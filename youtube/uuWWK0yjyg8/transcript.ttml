<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:54.510" style="s2">with a host of information on what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">would consider to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.510" end="00:06:59.490" style="s2">the most comprehensive nootropic stack</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:02.100" style="s2">ever made and what actually happens to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.490" end="00:07:02.790" style="s2">be circulating in my bloodstream and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.100" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">my brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.790" end="00:07:09.090" style="s2">right now so my guest today is Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:11.610" style="s2">schmuck dan berger and i just love that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.090" end="00:07:13.830" style="s2">last name because any name that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.610" end="00:07:16.410" style="s2">multi syllabic that i can say well</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.830" end="00:07:18.750" style="s2">without butchering it I&#39;ll take it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:21.630" style="s2">Daniel schmuck didn&#39;t burger I almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.750" end="00:07:22.890" style="s2">butchered at that time Daniel has</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.630" end="00:07:24.540" style="s2">actually been studying health and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.890" end="00:07:26.010" style="s2">neurology for quite some time he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.540" end="00:07:28.680" style="s2">originally afflicted with some</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.010" end="00:07:31.320" style="s2">neurological and autoimmune illnesses</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.680" end="00:07:32.640" style="s2">that he&#39;ll fill us in on but I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.320" end="00:07:34.650" style="s2">able to get him fixed with allopathic</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.640" end="00:07:36.150" style="s2">medicine or complementary medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.650" end="00:07:39.330" style="s2">so he really took a deep dive into</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.150" end="00:07:42.900" style="s2">physiology and pathology and became a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.330" end="00:07:45.330" style="s2">real academic of mind-body medicine a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.900" end="00:07:47.340" style="s2">student of mind-body medicine and he has</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.330" end="00:07:50.220" style="s2">a huge background now in everything from</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.340" end="00:07:53.040" style="s2">psychedelics to nootropics to meditation</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.220" end="00:07:56.190" style="s2">to psychology to all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.040" end="00:07:58.710" style="s2">tools for evolving states and stages of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.190" end="00:08:01.560" style="s2">consciousness and evolving the human</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.710" end="00:08:03.000" style="s2">cognitive experience and he brings all</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.560" end="00:08:06.660" style="s2">this together along with a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.000" end="00:08:08.490" style="s2">scientific research on his website which</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.660" end="00:08:11.160" style="s2">i will link to in the show notes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.490" end="00:08:14.910" style="s2">called the neuro hacker collective and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.160" end="00:08:17.940" style="s2">the specific flavor of nootropic that he</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.910" end="00:08:20.070" style="s2">has created is called qualia and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.940" end="00:08:22.110" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna delve into that and probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.070" end="00:08:26.850" style="s2">take the deepest dive we&#39;ve ever taken</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.110" end="00:08:29.250" style="s2">into neuro hacking hacking the biology</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.850" end="00:08:30.750" style="s2">of your brain your cognition the problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.250" end="00:08:32.700" style="s2">with modern smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.750" end="00:08:35.040" style="s2">affecting your neurons in a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.700" end="00:08:37.860" style="s2">positive way building new brain cells</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.040" end="00:08:40.350" style="s2">and a whole lot more so Daniel thanks</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.860" end="00:08:42.030" style="s2">for coming on the show man Ben thanks</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.350" end="00:08:44.840" style="s2">for having me it&#39;s good to be here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.030" end="00:08:48.030" style="s2">no problem and you are down in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.840" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">Encinitas California right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.030" end="00:08:54.540" style="s2">correct yeah I like it the land of yoga</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:56.250" style="s2">pants and also Navy SEALs I suppose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.540" end="00:08:58.890" style="s2">kind of a weird place right Navy SEALs</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.250" end="00:09:01.080" style="s2">and yoga pants is the intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.890" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">both of those things you aren&#39;t wearing</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.080" end="00:09:05.880" style="s2">yoga pants and dressed up as a Navy SEAL</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:08.040" style="s2">with a trident are you yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.880" end="00:09:09.720" style="s2">private okay all right all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.040" end="00:09:11.870" style="s2">a little bit awkward but we&#39;ll uh we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.720" end="00:09:14.970" style="s2">leave that to everyone&#39;s imagination</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.870" end="00:09:18.300" style="s2">anyways so Daniel before we jump into</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.970" end="00:09:20.250" style="s2">this this whole idea of of nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.300" end="00:09:22.380" style="s2">and cognitive enhancement and and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.250" end="00:09:25.949" style="s2">nitty-gritty you know nuts and bolts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.380" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">how to do it um I&#39;m curious about what</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.949" end="00:09:29.250" style="s2">happened to you because I know you had</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:30.690" style="s2">some kind of an illness or something</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.250" end="00:09:32.339" style="s2">that kind of led you down this road but</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.690" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">what exactly was going on with you</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.339" end="00:09:35.339" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:38.069" style="s2">this a field that I&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.339" end="00:09:40.829" style="s2">interested in the capability for us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.069" end="00:09:43.649" style="s2">develop human potential in general and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.829" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">cognitive and psychological potential in</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.649" end="00:09:48.060" style="s2">specific as well as just kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:49.949" style="s2">cutting edge of personalized and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.060" end="00:09:51.899" style="s2">integrative medicine both on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.949" end="00:09:54.779" style="s2">diagnostic and therapeutic sides and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.899" end="00:09:57.569" style="s2">with my background orientation towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.779" end="00:10:00.259" style="s2">whole systems complex system science and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.569" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">integrating multiple disciplines and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.259" end="00:10:04.649" style="s2">approaches together that like I said</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">that had always been an area of deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.649" end="00:10:11.630" style="s2">interest but several years back I did</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:13.620" style="s2">start having a bunch of symptoms and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.630" end="00:10:16.470" style="s2">when I went and got traditional</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.620" end="00:10:18.380" style="s2">Diagnostics I had both autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.470" end="00:10:21.029" style="s2">rheumatic disease and signs of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.380" end="00:10:23.069" style="s2">neurodegenerative process and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.029" end="00:10:26.069" style="s2">specific things that I had going on did</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.069" end="00:10:28.410" style="s2">not have any kind of adequate treatment</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.069" end="00:10:30.209" style="s2">in allopathic medicine and there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.410" end="00:10:32.790" style="s2">even consistent success anywhere in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.209" end="00:10:35.370" style="s2">integrative medicine and so the answer</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.790" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">for me was to just start seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.370" end="00:10:38.850" style="s2">understand what tissues were being</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:41.970" style="s2">damaged by what chemicals what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.850" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">happening Chane and those causal</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.970" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">cascades that would lead to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:47.069" style="s2">happening what could be the you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:49.199" style="s2">Tier one deviations from homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.069" end="00:10:51.089" style="s2">they could lead to those kind of cascade</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.199" end="00:10:54.089" style="s2">and so that just meant starting to model</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.089" end="00:10:56.670" style="s2">out the systems in a more complex way</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.089" end="00:10:59.459" style="s2">where we don&#39;t silo between Neurology</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.670" end="00:11:01.230" style="s2">gastroenterology immunology etc because</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.459" end="00:11:04.110" style="s2">obviously I&#39;ve got brain access disorder</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.230" end="00:11:06.689" style="s2">can you know be affecting neurologic</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.110" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">tissues and so when we started to model</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.689" end="00:11:12.209" style="s2">that applying complex systems ontology a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:14.459" style="s2">lot of really novel insight started to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.209" end="00:11:16.980" style="s2">come about and it led to me figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.459" end="00:11:19.139" style="s2">how to do appropriate Diagnostics for</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.980" end="00:11:21.750" style="s2">myself of what was going on I found a</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.139" end="00:11:23.700" style="s2">number of key like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.750" end="00:11:26.610" style="s2">what you would call original cause and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.700" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">then also call Cascade insights and was</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.610" end="00:11:33.420" style="s2">able to actually reverse those both the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:35.100" style="s2">disease pathology as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.420" end="00:11:37.170" style="s2">underlying causes reverse the out of me</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.100" end="00:11:39.720" style="s2">and antibodies etc and then was able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.170" end="00:11:42.090" style="s2">do similar things for many friends that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.720" end="00:11:44.280" style="s2">had also had diagnoses that had no</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.090" end="00:11:47.250" style="s2">formal treatment and this led to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.280" end="00:11:49.380" style="s2">series of insights about not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.250" end="00:11:51.710" style="s2">nootropics or neuropsychopharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.380" end="00:11:53.640" style="s2">but the future of medicine as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.710" end="00:11:56.790" style="s2">how do we do a better job of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.640" end="00:11:58.650" style="s2">understanding what health is in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.790" end="00:12:00.900" style="s2">whole system resilience and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.650" end="00:12:05.280" style="s2">diseases in terms of decreased</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.900" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">resilience and pathophysiology and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.280" end="00:12:09.000" style="s2">the future of adequate integrative</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:11.520" style="s2">personalized medicine could look like</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.000" end="00:12:13.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of big words man I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.520" end="00:12:14.910" style="s2">curious in terms of like the specific</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.080" end="00:12:18.060" style="s2">nitty gritties like well what are a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.910" end="00:12:19.740" style="s2">couple examples of you know the thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.060" end="00:12:21.090" style="s2">things that you did like like when</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.740" end="00:12:22.620" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about autoimmune issues</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.090" end="00:12:25.470" style="s2">or neurological dysfunction where you</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.620" end="00:12:28.589" style="s2">just like you know drinking bone broth</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.470" end="00:12:31.020" style="s2">and following like like an autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.589" end="00:12:34.440" style="s2">diet where your nating you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.020" end="00:12:36.390" style="s2">nightshades and and dairy and soy or</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.440" end="00:12:38.430" style="s2">were you like where you were you poem</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.390" end="00:12:39.930" style="s2">like a lot of like fringe little little</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.430" end="00:12:41.910" style="s2">bio hacks or i know what you call neuro</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.930" end="00:12:43.530" style="s2">hacks out and if so like what workup</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.910" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">we&#39;re just a couple of things that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.530" end="00:12:47.970" style="s2">did that that kind of like affected some</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">really significant change well you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.970" end="00:12:51.839" style="s2">how sometimes you talked to integrative</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:56.790" style="s2">doctors or bio hackers that really focus</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.839" end="00:12:59.550" style="s2">on mold or yeast or GI parasites or</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.790" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">pathogens or dysbiosis or methylation</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.550" end="00:13:04.530" style="s2">disorders from genetic predispositions</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:07.140" style="s2">or HPA access disorders or Lyme&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.530" end="00:13:08.760" style="s2">disease or heavy metal toxicity or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.140" end="00:13:11.130" style="s2">like how do you put all of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.760" end="00:13:13.589" style="s2">together of all forms of toxicity all</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.130" end="00:13:15.240" style="s2">forms of deficiency all forms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.589" end="00:13:17.220" style="s2">pathogenicity code imbalance because</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.240" end="00:13:19.500" style="s2">you&#39;re obviously going to treat Lyme</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.220" end="00:13:21.000" style="s2">disease in terms of actual Borrelia in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.500" end="00:13:22.589" style="s2">the blood very differently then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.000" end="00:13:23.670" style="s2">gonna treat a mucosal infection or</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.589" end="00:13:26.100" style="s2">you&#39;re going to treat heavy metal</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.670" end="00:13:28.650" style="s2">toxicity and and so the key for me was</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.100" end="00:13:30.930" style="s2">actually in numerating the entire space</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.650" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">of all the things that could be involved</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.930" end="00:13:34.920" style="s2">doing complex diagnostics across the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:35.220" style="s2">whole space and then rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.920" end="00:13:38.029" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.220" end="00:13:40.439" style="s2">a shotgun approach have very targeted</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.029" end="00:13:41.910" style="s2">therapy that factored exactly what was</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.439" end="00:13:43.170" style="s2">going on for me that would be totally</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.910" end="00:13:45.209" style="s2">different than was my month or someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.170" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">else that had the same disease diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.209" end="00:13:51.629" style="s2">because you can have multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:53.730" style="s2">deviations from balance deviations from</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.629" end="00:13:57.420" style="s2">homeostasis that can lead to the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.730" end="00:13:58.740" style="s2">kind of disease disorder so I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.420" end="00:14:00.839" style="s2">specific kinds of treatments from</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.740" end="00:14:02.610" style="s2">mucosal infections weird infections I</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.839" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">had in my gut from international travel</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.610" end="00:14:07.829" style="s2">and that was both meds so Alinea and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.829" style="s2">ivermectin and you know a number of kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.829" end="00:14:13.439" style="s2">of normal and not very common</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.829" end="00:14:16.709" style="s2">anti-parasitic anti bacterial meds and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.439" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">lot of supplements that were both</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.709" end="00:14:23.579" style="s2">addressing mucosal function addressing</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">infection directly and so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.579" end="00:14:26.790" style="s2">like an example of dealing with GI</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:29.639" style="s2">infection where we were dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.790" end="00:14:31.819" style="s2">other mucosal infection like things in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.639" end="00:14:35.550" style="s2">sinuses then there were specific</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.819" end="00:14:38.129" style="s2">anti-infectious and biofilm killing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.550" end="00:14:41.220" style="s2">biofilm breaking things that I did</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.129" end="00:14:44.339" style="s2">intranasally a lot of IV therapies IV</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.220" end="00:14:48.809" style="s2">chelation glutathione etc for aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.339" end="00:14:51.029" style="s2">toxicity and ozone ultraviolet lights</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.809" end="00:14:54.180" style="s2">for some humeral infections openness of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.029" end="00:14:55.860" style="s2">things but it it wasn&#39;t just like all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.180" end="00:14:58.470" style="s2">the integrative things it was very</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.860" end="00:15:00.449" style="s2">specifically targeted towards what order</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.470" end="00:15:02.309" style="s2">of operations make sense on what things</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.449" end="00:15:04.019" style="s2">that are here right right that makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.309" end="00:15:05.339" style="s2">sense so so you you were not just like</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.019" end="00:15:07.110" style="s2">throwing everything in the kitchen sink</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.339" end="00:15:09.019" style="s2">at your body and some like desperate</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.110" end="00:15:11.100" style="s2">attempt to fix yourself you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.019" end="00:15:12.839" style="s2">I&#39;m assuming doing like blood and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.100" end="00:15:15.209" style="s2">biomarker testing as you went along</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.839" end="00:15:17.550" style="s2">researching a lot of this stuff yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.209" end="00:15:19.470" style="s2">started with comprehensive Diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.550" end="00:15:21.209" style="s2">across the whole spectrum of things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.470" end="00:15:22.829" style="s2">could be involved and then said okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.209" end="00:15:24.930" style="s2">does this make sense if we look at my</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.829" end="00:15:26.819" style="s2">medical history when certain symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.930" end="00:15:29.879" style="s2">started when I was exposed to certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.819" end="00:15:32.819" style="s2">things I look at the the whole landscape</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.879" end="00:15:35.009" style="s2">of biometrics now and an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.819" end="00:15:36.779" style="s2">of how causation could occur do I kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.009" end="00:15:39.209" style="s2">of have a story of when these exposures</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.779" end="00:15:41.540" style="s2">likely happened when these kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.209" end="00:15:45.569" style="s2">know exposures to toxins infections etc</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.540" end="00:15:46.860" style="s2">injuries stresses and then if you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.569" end="00:15:48.420" style="s2">put a picture together then you can get</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.860" end="00:15:50.520" style="s2">a sense of okay what would</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.420" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">project plan for reversing the speed</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.520" end="00:15:56.010" style="s2">obviously if you&#39;ve got some kind of say</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:57.930" style="s2">GI mucosal infection that is causing</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.010" end="00:16:00.180" style="s2">continuous inflammation to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.930" end="00:16:01.050" style="s2">bloodstream or allowing toxicity go into</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.180" end="00:16:02.370" style="s2">the bloodstream you&#39;re gonna want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.050" end="00:16:05.490" style="s2">address that before trying to address</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.370" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">the blood side most of the time so order</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.490" end="00:16:09.540" style="s2">of operations etc that&#39;s just all things</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:12.840" style="s2">you would factor if you&#39;re doing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.540" end="00:16:14.700" style="s2">comprehensive treatment yeah and I know</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.840" end="00:16:17.190" style="s2">that today we&#39;re gonna focus a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.700" end="00:16:18.930" style="s2">and kind of like the like the nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.190" end="00:16:20.370" style="s2">status of things alright like like like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.930" end="00:16:22.110" style="s2">nutrients that you could put into your</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.370" end="00:16:23.850" style="s2">body to assist with nervous system and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.110" end="00:16:25.650" style="s2">with brain health and with even like</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.850" end="00:16:28.050" style="s2">building you know new neurons and things</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.650" end="00:16:30.810" style="s2">like that but in the show notes</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.050" end="00:16:32.640" style="s2">I&#39;m putting the shows over at Ben</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.810" end="00:16:35.160" style="s2">Greenfield fitness comm slash neuro</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.640" end="00:16:38.520" style="s2">hacker as in Walter so it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.160" end="00:16:40.500" style="s2">neuro hacker um but that&#39;s a phrase I</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.520" end="00:16:43.020" style="s2">hadn&#39;t really heard thrown around until</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.500" end="00:16:44.580" style="s2">I heard you use it I&#39;m Daniel and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.020" end="00:16:46.170" style="s2">just curious when it comes to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.580" end="00:16:47.730" style="s2">of neuro hacking before we delve into</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.170" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">the Nitty Gritty of what you know kinda</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.730" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">like a dream nootropic would look like</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:53.880" style="s2">but what exactly is neuro hacking I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:55.590" style="s2">how do you how do you find neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.880" end="00:16:58.140" style="s2">what is it that your company does from</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.590" end="00:16:59.340" style="s2">this neuro hacking standpoint like I</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.140" end="00:17:02.760" style="s2">said even though I&#39;ve been interested in</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.340" end="00:17:04.500" style="s2">the field of cognitive optimization for</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.760" end="00:17:06.449" style="s2">a long time one of the things that had</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.500" end="00:17:07.680" style="s2">me do a deep dive into it when I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.449" end="00:17:10.709" style="s2">wrestling with some of these issues</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.680" end="00:17:11.940" style="s2">myself is that some of the symptoms I</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.709" end="00:17:15.510" style="s2">was dealing with were cognitive decline</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.940" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">and my background and like my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.510" end="00:17:20.040" style="s2">work being cognitively engaging things</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:22.770" style="s2">that was more debilitating than than</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.040" end="00:17:24.060" style="s2">physical issues for sure and since I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.770" end="00:17:26.550" style="s2">gonna have to try and study and figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.060" end="00:17:28.650" style="s2">out an adequate approach since when</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.550" end="00:17:31.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t exist obviously I couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.650" end="00:17:33.720" style="s2">that well while having cognitive decline</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.110" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">so my first thing that I applied the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.720" end="00:17:38.190" style="s2">cognitive and what I had to was how do I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:39.330" style="s2">increase cognitive and words and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.190" end="00:17:41.910" style="s2">was a deep dive into the study of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.330" end="00:17:44.550" style="s2">cognition smart drugs nootropics etc</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.910" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">again applying complex systems models</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.550" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like well okay so what really is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:50.760" style="s2">being mediated by acetylcholine what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.020" end="00:17:52.650" style="s2">being mediated by catecholamines by</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.760" end="00:17:55.590" style="s2">glutamate by how do these systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.650" end="00:17:57.090" style="s2">interface you know etc getting a more</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:18:00.930" style="s2">detailed understanding and then seeing</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.090" end="00:18:02.360" style="s2">how to support that whole process now</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.930" end="00:18:04.590" style="s2">fast-forwarding</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.360" end="00:18:06.300" style="s2">one of the things we realized was that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.590" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">people who are dealing with chronic</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.300" end="00:18:10.560" style="s2">complex disease we&#39;re gonna have to do a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:13.850" style="s2">lot of things and that have some</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.560" end="00:18:16.110" style="s2">complication are also dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.850" end="00:18:18.690" style="s2">decreased cognitive function decreased</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.110" end="00:18:20.130" style="s2">energy and some you know emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.690" end="00:18:21.480" style="s2">difficulty that makes it hard to do what</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.130" end="00:18:24.030" style="s2">they need to so being able to support</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.480" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">those areas is hugely beneficial but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:27.900" style="s2">rest of treating their pathology but</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">then of course that&#39;s just relevant for</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.900" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">everyone right even at the other end of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:35.670" style="s2">the bell curve people who are looking</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:39.240" style="s2">for real optimization enhancement and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.670" end="00:18:42.330" style="s2">neuro hacking for us is you could almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.240" end="00:18:45.240" style="s2">think of it as a subset of biohacking</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.330" end="00:18:46.890" style="s2">but also kind of a Venn diagram with it</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.240" end="00:18:49.650" style="s2">where we&#39;re looking at hacking the mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.890" end="00:18:52.410" style="s2">brain interface what things can we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.650" end="00:18:54.090" style="s2">that enhance so we&#39;re not looking so</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.410" end="00:18:56.070" style="s2">much at athletic performance even though</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.090" end="00:18:58.290" style="s2">that can be a positive side effect we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.070" end="00:19:00.990" style="s2">looking at optimizing cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.290" end="00:19:04.170" style="s2">capability and psycho emotional state</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.990" end="00:19:07.410" style="s2">and predisposition okay got it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.170" end="00:19:10.350" style="s2">so when when we start to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.410" end="00:19:13.050" style="s2">delve into the actual nitty-gritty of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.350" end="00:19:16.590" style="s2">especially like the type of nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.050" end="00:19:19.140" style="s2">that you can put into your brain my</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.590" end="00:19:22.890" style="s2">first question is before we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.140" end="00:19:26.220" style="s2">individual ingredients the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.890" end="00:19:27.990" style="s2">that I&#39;m curious about because I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.220" end="00:19:30.570" style="s2">want to know how this works from an</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.990" end="00:19:32.340" style="s2">acute effect obviously when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.570" end="00:19:35.100" style="s2">takes like a handful of pills right I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.340" end="00:19:37.740" style="s2">get like a nootropic or some powder or</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.100" end="00:19:42.060" style="s2">some tincture or extract designed to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.740" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">know help your brain fire better um is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.060" end="00:19:47.100" style="s2">there an actual chronic change in brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:49.410" style="s2">structure I mean is there any evidence</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.100" end="00:19:53.610" style="s2">out there that you can do things like</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.410" end="00:19:56.250" style="s2">build new neurons or you know reset your</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.610" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">tolerance to things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.250" end="00:20:01.740" style="s2">caffeine or increase the production of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:04.200" style="s2">mitochondria or cell membranes or</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.740" end="00:20:07.770" style="s2">anything along those lines um what what</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.200" end="00:20:11.040" style="s2">can be done in the brain by putting the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.770" end="00:20:13.060" style="s2">right nutrients into it yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.040" end="00:20:14.500" style="s2">really important question</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.060" end="00:20:16.800" style="s2">when we think about smart drugs in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.500" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">general we oftentimes think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.800" end="00:20:22.900" style="s2">pharmaceuticals that are being used for</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:27.030" style="s2">off-label purposes like adderall or</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.900" end="00:20:29.830" style="s2">Ritalin or etc we&#39;ll notice that we get</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.030" end="00:20:31.900" style="s2">immediate lift in certain metrics like</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.830" end="00:20:35.110" style="s2">focus or concentration or you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.900" end="00:20:37.720" style="s2">something that&#39;s useful but those lifts</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.110" end="00:20:39.670" style="s2">not only usually are not lasting don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.720" end="00:20:40.780" style="s2">produce positive long-term effects but</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.670" end="00:20:44.500" style="s2">oftentimes you&#39;re producing negative</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.780" end="00:20:46.450" style="s2">long-term effects either because of side</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.500" end="00:20:47.950" style="s2">effects and other systems or even the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.450" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">system they&#39;re affecting they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.950" end="00:20:51.610" style="s2">affecting in a way that creates</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:53.110" style="s2">dependence and the primary way to think</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.610" end="00:20:54.790" style="s2">about this is if you have a regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.110" end="00:20:57.220" style="s2">system like say we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.790" end="00:20:59.310" style="s2">adderall you have a an endogenous system</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.220" end="00:21:03.130" style="s2">that&#39;s regulating dopamine levels and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.310" end="00:21:05.350" style="s2">catecholamine levels if I override that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.130" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">system through an external right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.350" end="00:21:09.340" style="s2">exhaustion is stimulate then I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">to create dependence upon that exotic</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.340" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">stimulus and that means down regulation</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:18.490" style="s2">one of our fundamental goals was how do</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:20.410" style="s2">we understand how the body&#39;s endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.490" end="00:21:22.060" style="s2">regulatory systems work and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.410" end="00:21:24.490" style="s2">override them work through those</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.060" end="00:21:26.170" style="s2">pathways where we can increase system</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.490" end="00:21:29.010" style="s2">resilience and robustness where if</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.170" end="00:21:31.060" style="s2">someone got off of whatever it was that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.010" end="00:21:33.820" style="s2">they were taking they would actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.060" end="00:21:35.830" style="s2">have lasting positives because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.820" end="00:21:37.540" style="s2">underlying regulatory systems had become</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.830" end="00:21:39.610" style="s2">more robust so that was a core goal for</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.540" end="00:21:42.220" style="s2">us and there&#39;s a number of ways of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.610" end="00:21:43.810" style="s2">happening so you&#39;ve got obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.220" end="00:21:47.170" style="s2">immediate effects that are usually going</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.810" end="00:21:49.620" style="s2">to be neurochemical neuro endocrine kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.170" end="00:21:51.610" style="s2">of effects changing people&#39;s levels of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.620" end="00:21:53.410" style="s2">neurotransmitters receptor site</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.610" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">modulation things like that in effect</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.410" end="00:21:58.120" style="s2">those fairly quickly you&#39;ve got a medium</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:22:00.030" style="s2">term effects which can come from things</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.120" end="00:22:02.380" style="s2">like decreasing inflammation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.030" end="00:22:04.450" style="s2">affecting say the phospholipid cell</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.380" end="00:22:07.180" style="s2">membrane to have more integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.450" end="00:22:08.500" style="s2">elasticity and then you&#39;ve got longer</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.180" end="00:22:10.270" style="s2">term effects like the ones that you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.500" end="00:22:12.700" style="s2">mentioning where you start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.270" end="00:22:16.020" style="s2">things like neurogenesis the development</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.700" end="00:22:18.700" style="s2">of new neurons new neural stem cells and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.020" end="00:22:22.330" style="s2">synaptogenesis the development of new</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.700" end="00:22:24.550" style="s2">synapses and both of those as a category</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.330" end="00:22:27.130" style="s2">of biogenesis right new biological</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.550" end="00:22:29.350" style="s2">structural development increased</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.130" end="00:22:30.670" style="s2">mitochondria within cells these are not</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.350" end="00:22:32.170" style="s2">going to be permanent because nothing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.670" end="00:22:34.900" style="s2">permanent and it&#39;s a continuous of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.170" end="00:22:36.430" style="s2">changing environment just like exercise</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.900" end="00:22:39.070" style="s2">and muscle development is not permanent</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.430" end="00:22:40.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s lasting meaning if you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.070" end="00:22:42.580" style="s2">then damaging those structures and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.840" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">you&#39;re continuing to support them there</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.580" end="00:22:49.270" style="s2">is lasting structural change so I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:50.950" style="s2">say with anaerobic or in general one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.270" end="00:22:53.590" style="s2">people&#39;s goals should be how do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.950" end="00:22:55.030" style="s2">create short-term immediate benefit</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.590" end="00:22:56.740" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for without creating</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.030" end="00:22:59.230" style="s2">meaningful side-effects or down</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.740" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">regulation how do we up regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.230" end="00:23:05.470" style="s2">regulatory systems for lasting benefit</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:07.000" style="s2">and how do we regulate structure in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.470" end="00:23:09.790" style="s2">way that&#39;s going to produce again</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.000" end="00:23:12.190" style="s2">regulatory lasting benefit when you look</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.790" end="00:23:14.860" style="s2">at things like you&#39;ve got the company</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.190" end="00:23:16.840" style="s2">neural stem that is in late-stage</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.860" end="00:23:19.800" style="s2">clinical trials for their product NSI</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.840" end="00:23:23.020" style="s2">189 it wasn&#39;t what&#39;s called neuro stem</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.800" end="00:23:26.230" style="s2">neural stem they&#39;re a boutique</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.020" end="00:23:29.380" style="s2">pharmaceutical company and they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.230" end="00:23:31.510" style="s2">originally working doing neural stem</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.380" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">cell injections for spinal cord injuries</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.510" end="00:23:36.460" style="s2">and ALS and they started figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:38.230" style="s2">some small molecules that made stem</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.460" end="00:23:44.140" style="s2">cells proliferate and their most famous</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.230" end="00:23:45.670" style="s2">one is a protocol NSI - 189 and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.140" end="00:23:48.700" style="s2">will probably become a pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.670" end="00:23:51.400" style="s2">drug but some people have already been</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.700" end="00:23:53.500" style="s2">using it as an atrophic and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.400" end="00:23:56.500" style="s2">its mechanism of action is neurogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.500" end="00:23:58.570" style="s2">right developing more neural stem cells</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.500" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">that increase gray matter density in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.570" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">hippocampus and then other areas and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:05.470" style="s2">it&#39;s been treating major depressive</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:07.660" style="s2">disorder and is this something that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.470" end="00:24:09.400" style="s2">people like would get prescribed by a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.660" end="00:24:11.650" style="s2">physician or is this like an injection</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.400" end="00:24:12.820" style="s2">into the brain or what is it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.650" end="00:24:14.020" style="s2">something that someone would get</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.820" end="00:24:15.940" style="s2">prescribed yet because it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.020" end="00:24:18.130" style="s2">finished FDA clearance but it probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.940" end="00:24:20.860" style="s2">will okay this is an example of one that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.130" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">is actually moving down that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.860" end="00:24:27.780" style="s2">pharmaceutical path but whether it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:31.330" style="s2">be used for say diabetic neuropathy or</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.780" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">anxiety or depression or Alzheimer&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.330" end="00:24:36.460" style="s2">you can help develop endogenously more</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:38.500" style="s2">neural stem cells that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.460" end="00:24:40.800" style="s2">very meaningful for lots of things what</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.500" end="00:24:43.710" style="s2">happens to be that there are nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.800" end="00:24:45.270" style="s2">are involved in our body&#39;s own process</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.710" end="00:24:47.190" style="s2">of doing that that can help in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.270" end="00:24:49.020" style="s2">direction and other kind of system</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.190" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">modulators so those are all things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.020" end="00:24:53.610" style="s2">we factor in the nootropics that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:55.110" style="s2">develop interesting so in retirement</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.610" end="00:24:57.540" style="s2">like new brain stem cells what about for</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.110" end="00:24:58.830" style="s2">people like TV eyes and you know head</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.540" end="00:25:00.840" style="s2">injuries and stuff like that I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.830" end="00:25:02.550" style="s2">gotten orbital fractures and TV eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.840" end="00:25:03.990" style="s2">concussions like they&#39;re going out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.550" end="00:25:07.080" style="s2">style when you talking about inducing</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.990" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">new brain stem cells or neurogenesis are</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.080" end="00:25:10.560" style="s2">you actually saying that that you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:12.350" style="s2">potentially like heal certain areas of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.560" end="00:25:17.640" style="s2">the brain yep</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.350" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">so when someone has a TBI a mild mild</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.640" end="00:25:20.490" style="s2">traumatic brain injury or severe</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:24.800" style="s2">traumatic brain injury the the first</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.490" end="00:25:28.350" style="s2">thing that has to happen is to protect</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.800" end="00:25:32.070" style="s2">ongoing damage so ongoing oxidative</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.350" end="00:25:33.690" style="s2">damage excitotoxin see any of the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.070" end="00:25:34.620" style="s2">of damage that can start to cascade and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.690" end="00:25:37.020" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about a head</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.620" end="00:25:39.780" style="s2">injury or a stroke or the no protection</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.020" end="00:25:42.990" style="s2">is a first goal and then beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.780" end="00:25:44.970" style="s2">where there has been actual damage to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.990" end="00:25:46.830" style="s2">neural networks then we want to see what</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.970" end="00:25:49.170" style="s2">can we do to help regenerate neural</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.830" end="00:25:52.380" style="s2">networks and you&#39;ve gotta know tropics</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.170" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">like amok see pean also known as mechs</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.380" end="00:25:58.710" style="s2">at all that have been used pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:26:00.930" style="s2">heavily off-label mostly for post stroke</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.710" end="00:26:03.680" style="s2">and other forms of traumatic brain</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.930" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">injury some of the russian peptides</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.680" end="00:26:09.000" style="s2">c-max and selling and some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:11.790" style="s2">common nootropics like some of the rasa</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.000" end="00:26:14.100" style="s2">Tam&#39;s and amp Atkins and new kept in</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.790" end="00:26:16.650" style="s2">particular have been found very both</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.100" end="00:26:19.190" style="s2">neuro protective and neurogenic and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.650" end="00:26:22.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve got things like lion&#39;s mane and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.190" end="00:26:24.750" style="s2">taurine and methyl b12 that are all</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.410" end="00:26:27.350" style="s2">neurogenic through normal endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.750" end="00:26:30.360" style="s2">processes so even though the field of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.350" end="00:26:32.280" style="s2">TBI treatment is only kind of scratching</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.360" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">the surface of these areas I do think in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.280" end="00:26:37.680" style="s2">the not-too-distant future we&#39;ll combine</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:41.100" style="s2">much better scan technologies like SPECT</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.680" end="00:26:44.460" style="s2">scans and better qejy along with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.100" end="00:26:46.140" style="s2">normal fMRI etc have a better picture of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.460" end="00:26:48.290" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and then have much</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.140" end="00:26:50.550" style="s2">better both protection and treatment</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.290" end="00:26:52.110" style="s2">capabilities yeah it actually is fun to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.550" end="00:26:53.330" style="s2">self quantify this stuff like I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.110" end="00:26:55.909" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.330" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">IIIi went down to Los Angeles and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.909" end="00:26:59.659" style="s2">visited this place called the peak brain</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:02.269" style="s2">Institute and spent about a week there</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.659" end="00:27:04.129" style="s2">learning how to how to do neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.269" end="00:27:07.489" style="s2">how to actually attach electrodes to my</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.129" end="00:27:08.840" style="s2">head and use this software in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.489" end="00:27:11.629" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re basically flying a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.840" end="00:27:13.399" style="s2">spaceship with your brain but you are</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.629" end="00:27:15.940" style="s2">being rewarded with audio and visual</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.399" end="00:27:18.950" style="s2">cues that encourage for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.940" end="00:27:20.869" style="s2">production of alpha or theta brainwaves</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.950" end="00:27:23.539" style="s2">or you know that decreased production</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.869" end="00:27:25.070" style="s2">like fast stressful beta brainwaves and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.539" end="00:27:26.989" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.070" end="00:27:29.419" style="s2">tried this type of brain training both</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.989" end="00:27:31.399" style="s2">with and without certain nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.419" end="00:27:33.350" style="s2">you know circulating in my system and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.399" end="00:27:34.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinct difference especially</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.350" end="00:27:37.669" style="s2">in the amount of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.820" end="00:27:40.460" style="s2">upregulated alpha or theta and decreased</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.669" end="00:27:42.289" style="s2">beta when you use a self quantification</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.460" end="00:27:44.409" style="s2">method like that obviously you know not</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.289" end="00:27:46.999" style="s2">everybody&#39;s gonna have like a whatever a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.409" end="00:27:48.769" style="s2">$3,000 piece of a you know electrode and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.999" end="00:27:50.809" style="s2">laptop they can do this with but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.769" end="00:27:51.710" style="s2">you know there&#39;s even there&#39;s even phone</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.809" end="00:27:53.299" style="s2">apps I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve played</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.710" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">around with a much Daniel but like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.299" end="00:27:57.559" style="s2">CNS tap test app where it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:27:59.570" style="s2">test your central nervous system by</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.559" end="00:28:01.519" style="s2">letting it keep track of how quickly you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.570" end="00:28:04.669" style="s2">can tap in a 60-second time frame or</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.519" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">like the like the n-back app on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.669" end="00:28:09.049" style="s2">iphone that just just allows you to test</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:10.850" style="s2">like your your short-term memory recall</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.049" end="00:28:12.889" style="s2">and and it really is interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.850" end="00:28:14.179" style="s2">you can see a distinct difference that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.889" end="00:28:16.850" style="s2">kind of goes above and beyond what you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.179" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">might get from say like a cup of coffee</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.850" end="00:28:23.929" style="s2">with this stuff well here&#39;s a real fun</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:25.519" style="s2">concept there obviously we are starting</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.929" end="00:28:26.869" style="s2">to get quantified self devices that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.519" end="00:28:30.009" style="s2">more available which is hugely</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.869" end="00:28:33.350" style="s2">beneficial because when when we can link</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.009" end="00:28:35.929" style="s2">assessment insights with whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.350" end="00:28:38.529" style="s2">doing you know in terms of influence</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.929" end="00:28:41.059" style="s2">then we get much better and shorter</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.529" end="00:28:43.309" style="s2">upregulation cycles in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.059" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">we&#39;re doing but we&#39;ve obviously got also</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.309" end="00:28:49.100" style="s2">hardware as it&#39;s becoming available so</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:51.049" style="s2">it&#39;s not 128 or 64 lead EEG but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.100" end="00:28:52.429" style="s2">Meuse is actually pretty neat for people</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.049" end="00:28:55.399" style="s2">being able to do neurofeedback on their</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.429" end="00:28:57.289" style="s2">own right and there&#39;s a few EEG</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.399" end="00:28:58.609" style="s2">neurofeedback devices that are starting</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.289" end="00:28:59.869" style="s2">to become commercially available that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.609" end="00:29:01.820" style="s2">are good enough that they&#39;re meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.869" end="00:29:03.769" style="s2">so these are all part of what we would</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.820" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">call the neuro hacking movement the both</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.769" end="00:29:09.770" style="s2">assessment and an influential tools</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:11.960" style="s2">and you notice I&#39;m not saying diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.770" end="00:29:16.040" style="s2">or treatment because we&#39;re not operating</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.960" end="00:29:17.420" style="s2">within the FDA medical space but these</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.040" end="00:29:19.430" style="s2">are all what we&#39;d call neural hacking</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.420" end="00:29:21.320" style="s2">tools that are meaningful and that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.430" end="00:29:23.030" style="s2">appreciate but when you mention that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.320" end="00:29:25.460" style="s2">were doing neurofeedback neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.030" end="00:29:28.340" style="s2">is not only helping you learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.460" end="00:29:30.620" style="s2">gain executive control of certain brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.340" end="00:29:33.170" style="s2">frequency states but the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.620" end="00:29:36.500" style="s2">that can be lastingly beneficial is you</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.170" end="00:29:38.060" style="s2">start having certain states be more</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.500" end="00:29:39.640" style="s2">common more baseline</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.060" end="00:29:42.230" style="s2">right and certain things that were</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.640" end="00:29:44.510" style="s2">common before saying xiety or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.230" end="00:29:46.550" style="s2">become less common less baseline that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.510" end="00:29:48.800" style="s2">corresponds with structural changes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.550" end="00:29:49.940" style="s2">so there but when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.800" end="00:29:52.520" style="s2">neurofeedback even though you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.940" end="00:29:54.890" style="s2">something on your scalp it&#39;s not doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.520" end="00:29:56.600" style="s2">any transcranial stem it&#39;s just reading</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.890" end="00:29:58.310" style="s2">and then you are using your own</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.600" end="00:30:02.780" style="s2">consciousness right you&#39;re using your</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.310" end="00:30:04.280" style="s2">own mind brain system to do different</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.780" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">things with your attention that actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.280" end="00:30:09.980" style="s2">leads to neuro plastic rewiring of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:13.370" style="s2">brain including development of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.980" end="00:30:15.620" style="s2">new neural networks and that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.370" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">also without EEG equipment that can</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.620" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">happen in when someone learns how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:21.770" style="s2">juggle or play drums or any new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">coordination tasks they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.770" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">having to develop new neural circuitry</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:30.110" style="s2">and now when you start mentioning adding</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:32.180" style="s2">something like nootropics in think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.110" end="00:30:33.860" style="s2">what happens if we&#39;re wanting someone if</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.180" end="00:30:35.960" style="s2">someone&#39;s wanting to do therapy to cure</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.860" end="00:30:37.370" style="s2">PTSD or they&#39;re wanting to do EEG</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.960" end="00:30:39.320" style="s2">neurofeedback to develop some new</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.370" end="00:30:41.180" style="s2">capabilities what if we could give them</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.320" end="00:30:43.160" style="s2">chemistry that actually made their brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.180" end="00:30:45.560" style="s2">more neural plastic first so it could</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.160" end="00:30:47.660" style="s2">change more with it per unit time of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.560" end="00:30:49.930" style="s2">doing that therapy and then we gave them</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.660" end="00:30:52.580" style="s2">other chemistry afterwards that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.930" end="00:30:55.850" style="s2">long-term potentiating that actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.580" end="00:30:58.100" style="s2">helped lock in that new learning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.850" end="00:31:01.370" style="s2">an example of sequencing so that could</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.100" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">look like micro dosing psilocybin before</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.370" end="00:31:06.230" style="s2">and doing something like silh tap</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.590" end="00:31:08.450" style="s2">afterwards and you get to balance that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.230" end="00:31:10.460" style="s2">plasticity make your synapses more</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.450" end="00:31:12.890" style="s2">susceptible to change and potentiation</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.460" end="00:31:15.080" style="s2">lock in the learning in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.890" end="00:31:16.340" style="s2">effective synaptic formation this would</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.080" end="00:31:18.530" style="s2">be an example of thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.340" end="00:31:20.899" style="s2">something kind of in a in a more</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.530" end="00:31:22.099" style="s2">comprehensive neuro hacking way</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.899" end="00:31:25.509" style="s2">yeah that that whole field of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.099" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">neuroplasticity is it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.509" end="00:31:29.570" style="s2">extremely interesting you know how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:31.580" style="s2">can strengthen or lessen existing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.570" end="00:31:33.950" style="s2">neuronal pathways or establish new</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.580" end="00:31:35.149" style="s2">neurons and and new connections which I</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.950" end="00:31:36.979" style="s2">know is is actually it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.149" end="00:31:38.869" style="s2">structural plasticity versus like</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.979" end="00:31:41.719" style="s2">building new pathways I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.869" end="00:31:43.489" style="s2">called synaptic plasticity but you make</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.719" end="00:31:45.080" style="s2">a good point right like like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.489" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">have to necessarily go out and spend</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.080" end="00:31:49.249" style="s2">thousands of dollars on neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:51.830" style="s2">software you can learn language you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.249" end="00:31:54.169" style="s2">you know play the ukulele you can tackle</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.830" end="00:31:55.639" style="s2">some some difficult interesting subject</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.169" end="00:31:57.859" style="s2">like like you know take take an online</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.639" end="00:32:00.379" style="s2">course of you to me or you know learn</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.859" end="00:32:01.639" style="s2">how to learn how to code and then you</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.379" end="00:32:03.259" style="s2">even mention you know something</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.639" end="00:32:04.729" style="s2">interesting even even like psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.259" end="00:32:07.009" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.729" end="00:32:09.619" style="s2">interesting topic i you know i&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.009" end="00:32:11.929" style="s2">psilocybin here and there and i have</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.619" end="00:32:14.029" style="s2">found that when i have used it the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.929" end="00:32:16.309" style="s2">situations in which I&#39;ve used psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.029" end="00:32:18.679" style="s2">in moderation with responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.309" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">with intention has actually resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.679" end="00:32:24.529" style="s2">the formation of intense memories that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:27.349" style="s2">are far brighter and more clear and more</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.529" end="00:32:29.450" style="s2">colorful than memories formed in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.349" end="00:32:31.339" style="s2">absence of something like psilocybin so</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.450" end="00:32:33.710" style="s2">yeah I think this this whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.339" end="00:32:36.830" style="s2">neuroplasticity is is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.710" end="00:32:38.629" style="s2">and I want to actually delve into some</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.830" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">of the ingredients that you can put into</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.629" end="00:32:42.019" style="s2">your body to make it more neural plastic</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:44.779" style="s2">but also to do things like you know shut</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.019" end="00:32:47.210" style="s2">down brain inflammation or provide the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.779" end="00:32:49.129" style="s2">brain with you know neuro vitamins etc</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.210" end="00:32:51.289" style="s2">but before I ask you about that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.129" end="00:32:52.669" style="s2">curious just just for fun do you you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.289" end="00:32:54.979" style="s2">know I was talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.669" end="00:32:56.690" style="s2">neurofeedback for example and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.979" end="00:32:58.969" style="s2">mentioned the Muse headband for</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.690" end="00:33:02.239" style="s2">meditation do you have anything that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.969" end="00:33:03.649" style="s2">do on a regular basis in kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.239" end="00:33:05.929" style="s2">the tech sector not necessarily like</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.649" end="00:33:08.869" style="s2">pills that you pop but but do you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.929" end="00:33:10.729" style="s2">like tDCS or electro stem or or anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.869" end="00:33:12.559" style="s2">along those lines to enhance your own</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.729" end="00:33:16.099" style="s2">neuroplasticity any any special bio</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.559" end="00:33:17.450" style="s2">hacks that you use frequently yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.099" end="00:33:21.889" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t just say for neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.450" end="00:33:24.830" style="s2">but for mind brain nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.889" end="00:33:27.349" style="s2">optimization comprehensively so right</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.830" end="00:33:31.099" style="s2">where I&#39;m sitting like within just a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.349" end="00:33:34.190" style="s2">reach of my seat I&#39;ve got the violate</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.099" end="00:33:37.100" style="s2">intranasal transcranial lasers</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.190" end="00:33:39.500" style="s2">and my I like that technology quite a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.100" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">lot it&#39;s actually and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.500" end="00:33:43.400" style="s2">interrupt you super quickly because this</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.140" style="s2">is the million dollar question Daniel do</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.400" end="00:33:47.300" style="s2">you have the one that that like wraps</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.140" end="00:33:49.610" style="s2">around your entire head and goes in your</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.300" end="00:33:52.070" style="s2">nose or are you an underachiever and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.610" end="00:33:54.470" style="s2">just have one that goes in your nose no</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.070" end="00:33:57.110" style="s2">no head and nose both how nice you do so</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.470" end="00:33:59.660" style="s2">you have that you have the noir oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.110" end="00:34:03.080" style="s2">oh that thing is an isn&#39;t but we have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.660" end="00:34:07.100" style="s2">bunch of other you know fun transcranial</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.080" end="00:34:09.500" style="s2">laser technologies so this is primarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.100" end="00:34:12.970" style="s2">focused on increasing cider ATP levels</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.500" end="00:34:16.610" style="s2">through specific frequencies of light</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.970" end="00:34:19.130" style="s2">and obviously transcranial transcranial</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.610" end="00:34:22.310" style="s2">an intranasal for increasing ATP in</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.130" end="00:34:25.640" style="s2">neurons which are obviously very energy</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.310" end="00:34:27.860" style="s2">intensive and so I think that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.640" end="00:34:29.630" style="s2">a brilliant technology there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.860" end="00:34:31.669" style="s2">forms of transcranial stem transcranial</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.630" end="00:34:32.679" style="s2">direct current is interesting I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.669" end="00:34:34.880" style="s2">careful with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.679" end="00:34:36.620" style="s2">transcranial alternating current is</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.880" end="00:34:39.350" style="s2">interesting transcranial magnetic deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.620" end="00:34:40.790" style="s2">stem and we&#39;ve even got friends who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.350" end="00:34:43.160" style="s2">at the pioneering edge of transcranial</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.790" end="00:34:45.980" style="s2">ultrasound at University of Arizona</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.160" end="00:34:49.220" style="s2">Stuart Hameroff slab and number of other</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.980" end="00:34:52.070" style="s2">places that are pioneering work with</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.220" end="00:34:54.230" style="s2">transcranial ultrasound to reverse beta</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.070" end="00:34:56.390" style="s2">amyloid and tau phosphorylation involved</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.230" end="00:34:58.100" style="s2">with Alzheimer&#39;s so there are some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.390" end="00:34:59.840" style="s2">those technologies that I used regularly</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.100" end="00:35:02.630" style="s2">that are here and there are other ones</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.840" end="00:35:06.080" style="s2">that I&#39;ve went and used very</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.630" end="00:35:07.580" style="s2">specifically for specific conditions or</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.080" end="00:35:08.750" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.580" end="00:35:10.490" style="s2">because I don&#39;t have the things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.750" end="00:35:11.870" style="s2">they&#39;re needed but we use them with</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.490" end="00:35:14.090" style="s2">other people that they are procure is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.870" end="00:35:15.590" style="s2">right right used appropriately they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.090" end="00:35:18.350" style="s2">really amazing you know for example that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.590" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">that a violet device I was speaking with</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.350" end="00:35:23.990" style="s2">a really intelligent neurosurgeon and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:26.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve had in the podcast few times named</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.990" end="00:35:28.190" style="s2">dr. Jack Cruz and we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.660" end="00:35:29.810" style="s2">the use of things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.190" end="00:35:32.540" style="s2">intranasal light therapy and the use of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.810" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">like that head band that neuro headband</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.540" end="00:35:37.630" style="s2">and you know one of the ideas behind</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:40.070" style="s2">that and it&#39;s stimulation of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.630" end="00:35:41.810" style="s2">cytochrome C oxidase I believe is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.070" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">this specific area that stimulates is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.810" end="00:35:45.830" style="s2">creates a little bit of free radical</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:47.090" style="s2">production and so some of this stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.830" end="00:35:48.380" style="s2">know it&#39;s not like you&#39;re you&#39;re hooked</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.090" end="00:35:50.029" style="s2">up to it 24/7 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.380" end="00:35:53.349" style="s2">like that device you&#39;re supposed to use</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.029" end="00:35:55.130" style="s2">about once every two to three days or</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.349" end="00:35:58.009" style="s2">you know like you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.130" end="00:36:01.160" style="s2">transcranial direct stimulation that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.009" end="00:36:04.849" style="s2">tDCS which is often done with a headband</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.160" end="00:36:07.039" style="s2">I actually I&#39;ve been trialing a device</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.849" end="00:36:10.099" style="s2">called the the neuroscience made by a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.039" end="00:36:11.779" style="s2">company called halo and it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.099" end="00:36:13.910" style="s2">intense form of magnetic stimulation</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.779" end="00:36:15.880" style="s2">that that massively ramps up the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.910" end="00:36:18.470" style="s2">activity in the motor cortex and so it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.880" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">will for example decrease your</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.470" end="00:36:22.039" style="s2">sensitivity to discomfort during</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">exercise when you use it prior to an</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.039" end="00:36:26.119" style="s2">exercise session or increase your</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:28.849" style="s2">ability to be able to rip more weight</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.119" end="00:36:30.769" style="s2">off the floor during a deadlift but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.849" end="00:36:32.869" style="s2">also you&#39;re supposed to take a good 8 to</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.769" end="00:36:33.650" style="s2">10 hours between any type of sessions</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.869" end="00:36:36.019" style="s2">with something like that just because</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.650" end="00:36:38.059" style="s2">it&#39;s such an intense you know ride so to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.019" end="00:36:39.799" style="s2">speak for your brain so yeah some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.059" end="00:36:42.910" style="s2">this stuff is interesting you just have</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.799" end="00:36:42.910" style="s2">to use it responsibly right</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.980" end="00:36:52.570" style="s2">I want to interrupt this podcast to tell</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.890" end="00:36:54.910" style="s2">you about a few people that you need to</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.119" end="00:44:37.559" style="s2">the the ability to form relationships</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.829" end="00:44:39.890" style="s2">and connections with and understand and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.559" end="00:44:42.119" style="s2">be empathetic to people all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.890" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">super interesting effects even like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.119" end="00:44:47.460" style="s2">know reduced procrastination and reduced</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:49.260" style="s2">anxiety you know unfortunately this this</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.460" end="00:44:52.859" style="s2">effect stayed with me until about 4:00</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.260" end="00:44:54.450" style="s2">a.m. in the morning but I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.859" end="00:44:56.910" style="s2">want to quit writing articles and go to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.450" end="00:44:58.920" style="s2">sleep at some point but you know very</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.910" end="00:45:01.710" style="s2">very similar to almost like modafinil</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.920" end="00:45:04.049" style="s2">without actually you know kicking my</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.710" end="00:45:06.359" style="s2">liver into the ditch as modafinil can do</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.049" end="00:45:09.630" style="s2">and so that was my introduction and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.359" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2">later on I discovered that there there</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.630" end="00:45:14.849" style="s2">is actually perhaps a slightly less less</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.900" end="00:45:17.970" style="s2">intensive version of this stuff called</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.849" end="00:45:20.040" style="s2">called qualia and so that was what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.970" end="00:45:22.859" style="s2">took this morning for example I want one</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.040" end="00:45:24.210" style="s2">in the one bottle that you take in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.859" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">morning on an empty stomach in another</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.210" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">bottle that you take with with breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:31.049" style="s2">or with food in your gut and so that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:33.900" style="s2">what I want to delve into into this</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.049" end="00:45:35.430" style="s2">quality of stuff so in terms of qualia</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.900" end="00:45:37.410" style="s2">first of all why do</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.430" end="00:45:41.309" style="s2">you call this specific nootropic a blend</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.410" end="00:45:44.339" style="s2">that you make qualia it was a fun</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.309" end="00:45:46.140" style="s2">process when it comes to naming quality</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.339" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">is actually a term coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.140" end="00:45:51.210" style="s2">philosophy of mind which means the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:53.910" style="s2">quality of what it is like to be you so</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.210" end="00:45:55.470" style="s2">your subjective experience is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.910" end="00:45:57.809" style="s2">physical universe is made up of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.470" end="00:45:59.880" style="s2">particles and four fields the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.809" end="00:46:02.819" style="s2">universe is made up of qualia thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.880" end="00:46:05.790" style="s2">emotions sensations and so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.819" end="00:46:09.030" style="s2">just enhancing memory or digit span or</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.790" end="00:46:11.099" style="s2">arithmetic processing capabilities we</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.030" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">were alluding to the idea of optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.099" end="00:46:15.180" style="s2">one&#39;s experience of existing subjective</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">experience of existence so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.180" end="00:46:18.300" style="s2">happens to know philosophy of mind then</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:19.589" style="s2">they like oh cool they use the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.300" end="00:46:20.940" style="s2">philosophy of mind term and if someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.589" end="00:46:23.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s just a cool sounding word</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.940" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">that sounds kind of like quality okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.609" end="00:46:29.130" style="s2">got it makes sense all right so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:31.650" style="s2">got one two three four five six I</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.130" end="00:46:35.730" style="s2">believe seven different kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.650" end="00:46:38.069" style="s2">categories of nootropic stimulants in in</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.730" end="00:46:39.300" style="s2">the ingredients of this formulation and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.069" end="00:46:41.190" style="s2">that kind of returns to I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.300" end="00:46:42.990" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about before how you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.190" end="00:46:44.910" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just focus on one specific</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.990" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">area of brain enhancement you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.910" end="00:46:51.089" style="s2">somehow get all the parts to to interact</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:52.170" style="s2">and so if I could I&#39;d like to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.089" end="00:46:53.160" style="s2">about the difference between some of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.170" end="00:46:56.130" style="s2">these things because I think some people</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.160" end="00:46:58.740" style="s2">may not understand what all needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.130" end="00:47:00.750" style="s2">in a a complete brain compound so first</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.740" end="00:47:02.549" style="s2">of all and one of the first categories</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.750" end="00:47:06.150" style="s2">that you have in here are are nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.549" end="00:47:11.730" style="s2">compounds what exactly is a nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.150" end="00:47:14.520" style="s2">compound yeah loosely the term is</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.730" end="00:47:16.200" style="s2">generally used to mean some chemical</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.520" end="00:47:18.990" style="s2">that can enhance some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.200" end="00:47:23.400" style="s2">cognitive function beyond someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.990" end="00:47:26.099" style="s2">traditional baseline without meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.400" end="00:47:28.920" style="s2">side effects so it&#39;s in Contra</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.099" end="00:47:30.119" style="s2">distinction to smart drugs which would</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.920" end="00:47:32.460" style="s2">enhance some aspect of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.119" end="00:47:35.819" style="s2">function but might have some side</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.460" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">effects or brain nutrients which aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.819" end="00:47:40.020" style="s2">gonna enhance brain function beyond</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:41.730" style="s2">baseline they&#39;re gonna make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.020" end="00:47:43.290" style="s2">you don&#39;t drop below baseline or if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.730" end="00:47:44.940" style="s2">already are helped bring it back up but</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.290" end="00:47:46.890" style="s2">they&#39;re part of the kind of normal</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.940" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">process and so of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.890" end="00:47:50.850" style="s2">interested in in neuro hacking in</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:52.440" style="s2">all of those categories but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.850" end="00:47:55.770" style="s2">general way to think about what a nut</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.440" end="00:47:58.200" style="s2">tropic is and that term arose from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.770" end="00:48:00.090" style="s2">scientists that develop piracetam which</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.200" end="00:48:03.180" style="s2">was the first racetam and kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.090" end="00:48:04.770" style="s2">beginning of the major family of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.180" end="00:48:06.690" style="s2">chemicals and then there are other</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.770" end="00:48:07.980" style="s2">families of chemicals and Perkins and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.690" end="00:48:09.750" style="s2">other things that are part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.980" end="00:48:12.210" style="s2">usually think of we think of nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.750" end="00:48:15.120" style="s2">okay so so nootropic in general isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.210" end="00:48:16.230" style="s2">something like you know vitamin B to</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.120" end="00:48:17.940" style="s2">replace some things that you&#39;re burning</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.230" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">through and you&#39;re thinking or or like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.940" end="00:48:22.950" style="s2">you know choline or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:25.710" style="s2">but these are actual chemicals that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.950" end="00:48:27.330" style="s2">would do things like assist with cell</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.710" end="00:48:30.060" style="s2">membrane formation in the brain or</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.330" end="00:48:31.650" style="s2">cerebral perfusion or the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.060" end="00:48:35.010" style="s2">endocrine regulation or something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.650" end="00:48:36.840" style="s2">that something like that okay got it now</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.010" end="00:48:38.280" style="s2">one of the things if I want I want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.840" end="00:48:39.570" style="s2">target in a few kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.280" end="00:48:42.090" style="s2">interesting nutrients that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.570" end="00:48:44.370" style="s2">really familiar with in your compound</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.090" end="00:48:48.120" style="s2">and and one of the things that you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.370" end="00:48:50.880" style="s2">as part of the the neurotropic blend in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.120" end="00:48:53.610" style="s2">here is called hardening HCL am i</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:56.550" style="s2">pronouncing that correctly yes toward me</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.610" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">okay what what exactly is hor Dineen so</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.550" end="00:49:01.400" style="s2">cordoning is interesting it is a barley</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:03.600" style="s2">grass extract so it is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.400" end="00:49:06.630" style="s2">synthesized as it&#39;s an extracted</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.600" end="00:49:10.110" style="s2">compound and it is a fairly selective</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.630" end="00:49:13.020" style="s2">mao-b inhibitor and so you&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.110" end="00:49:17.430" style="s2">used or at least heard of saline Deborah</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.020" end="00:49:21.720" style="s2">Nell which is a fairly selective</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.430" end="00:49:23.450" style="s2">chemical mao-b inhibitor that is as many</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.720" end="00:49:26.310" style="s2">people have associated with</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.450" end="00:49:28.860" style="s2">life-extension as well as probably one</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.310" end="00:49:31.230" style="s2">of the the best know tropic smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.860" end="00:49:33.270" style="s2">and then there are other chemicals in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.230" end="00:49:36.510" style="s2">that category that are newer like reseed</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.270" end="00:49:38.820" style="s2">Joleen this is a herbal version of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.510" end="00:49:43.640" style="s2">something like that less potent in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.820" end="00:49:46.470" style="s2">dosage that we use and specifically so a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.640" end="00:49:47.850" style="s2">MAO inhibitor is inhibiting an enzyme</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.470" end="00:49:48.990" style="s2">that breaks down certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.850" end="00:49:50.190" style="s2">neurotransmitters so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.990" end="00:49:51.780" style="s2">neurotransmitters can actually get</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.190" end="00:49:54.420" style="s2">across the synapse more effectively</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.780" end="00:49:56.190" style="s2">mao-a and then they OB are going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.420" end="00:49:58.050" style="s2">protect different neurotransmitters more</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.190" end="00:50:00.750" style="s2">selectively mao-b</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.050" end="00:50:01.950" style="s2">is an MOV inhibitor like this is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.750" end="00:50:05.310" style="s2">to protect</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.950" end="00:50:07.230" style="s2">primarily dopamine and then some of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.310" end="00:50:12.060" style="s2">associated catecholamines norepinephrine</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.230" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">epinephrine and phenyl alanine and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.060" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">main reason that we include this and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:23.970" style="s2">include a small dose is phenol ethyl</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:27.210" style="s2">amine which is a minor mono Ameen that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.970" end="00:50:28.650" style="s2">category of neurotransmitters it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.210" end="00:50:30.900" style="s2">of the most it&#39;s one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.650" end="00:50:32.250" style="s2">active ingredients in chocolate and in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.900" end="00:50:34.530" style="s2">blue-green algae that gives the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.250" end="00:50:37.290" style="s2">psychoactive effect that it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.530" end="00:50:40.350" style="s2">kind of a euphoric effect but it has an</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.290" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">extremely short half-life and so it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.350" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">usually degrades in minutes and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:48.660" style="s2">been a very common stack in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:53.310" style="s2">nootropic world the neuro happen world</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.660" end="00:50:56.360" style="s2">to stack something like cordoning there</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.310" end="00:50:59.010" style="s2">are many other natural mao-b inhibitors</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.360" end="00:51:00.420" style="s2">but to stack that whiffing lefel amine</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.010" end="00:51:02.520" style="s2">so that it actually has a longer</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.420" end="00:51:05.400" style="s2">half-life and some of the positive</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.520" end="00:51:08.550" style="s2">psycho stimulatory and euphoric effects</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.400" end="00:51:10.320" style="s2">actually last longer and so it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.550" end="00:51:12.560" style="s2">obviously going to affect dopamine which</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.320" end="00:51:15.900" style="s2">we&#39;re addressing through a number of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.560" end="00:51:18.810" style="s2">ingredients and pathways so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.900" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">gist with that okay okay got it and in</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.810" end="00:51:22.560" style="s2">addition to that that&#39;s that&#39;s blended</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:23.610" style="s2">with a bunch of other things that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.560" end="00:51:26.760" style="s2">think some people may have may have</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.610" end="00:51:28.500" style="s2">heard of before like phenyl ethyl amine</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.760" end="00:51:30.300" style="s2">which is you know like like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.500" end="00:51:32.670" style="s2">neurotransmitter I know it&#39;s also known</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.300" end="00:51:35.490" style="s2">as the the love drug but it increases</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.670" end="00:51:38.490" style="s2">like euphoria and an arousal and an</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.490" end="00:51:39.900" style="s2">excitation phosphatidylserine is another</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.490" end="00:51:41.820" style="s2">one I think a lot of people know about</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.900" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">as a way to like increase mental</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.820" end="00:51:45.210" style="s2">processing speed I&#39;ve talked about one</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:46.950" style="s2">that you have in there before called</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.210" end="00:51:49.410" style="s2">vinpocetine which they actually had some</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.950" end="00:51:51.090" style="s2">really interesting research on in in NFL</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.410" end="00:51:53.670" style="s2">football players to reduce you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.090" end="00:51:56.160" style="s2">speaking of TBI a lot of the issues with</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:52:01.160" style="s2">in a study I think that dr. Daniel</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.910" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">which you mentioned and then another</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:17.550" style="s2">that nootropic blend that you have that</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.540" end="00:52:19.170" style="s2">I wanted to ask you about is that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.550" end="00:52:20.760" style="s2">have a you have a little bit of caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.170" end="00:52:22.110" style="s2">in there it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.760" end="00:52:24.110" style="s2">caffeine by you noted that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.110" end="00:52:28.550" style="s2">bind the caffeine to something called a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.110" end="00:52:32.370" style="s2">serous stilbene what why do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.550" end="00:52:35.220" style="s2">yeah so we don&#39;t actually bind that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.370" end="00:52:38.220" style="s2">get it from one of our partners called</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.220" end="00:52:41.660" style="s2">chroma Dex that makes a patent product</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.220" end="00:52:44.820" style="s2">called pure energy pure energy is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.660" end="00:52:47.880" style="s2">pterostilbene which is a antioxidant</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.820" end="00:52:51.840" style="s2">that comes from the primary antioxidant</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.880" end="00:52:53.370" style="s2">in blueberries and certain other natural</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.840" end="00:52:55.950" style="s2">compounds and they&#39;re binding that to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.370" end="00:52:58.650" style="s2">caffeine and specifically there are many</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.950" end="00:53:00.540" style="s2">companies that make pterostilbene this</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.650" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">company chromatics has a version of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.540" end="00:53:06.380" style="s2">called peat taro pure that they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:09.780" style="s2">good clinical trials on showing its</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.380" end="00:53:11.790" style="s2">effectiveness in as a cerebral</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.780" end="00:53:14.550" style="s2">antioxidant it&#39;s very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.790" end="00:53:16.770" style="s2">resveratrol pterostilbene is a few of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.550" end="00:53:19.050" style="s2">the reasons that it is preferred to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.770" end="00:53:21.540" style="s2">resveratrol often is that it has a much</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.050" end="00:53:23.850" style="s2">longer half-life in the blood and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.540" end="00:53:25.620" style="s2">crosses the blood-brain barrier to be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.850" end="00:53:28.590" style="s2">cerebral antioxidant more effectively</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.620" end="00:53:32.190" style="s2">and when caffeine is bound to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.590" end="00:53:36.570" style="s2">pterostilbene the the pharmacodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.190" end="00:53:38.730" style="s2">of it are very interesting so it slows</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.570" end="00:53:42.390" style="s2">the rate of caffeine into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.730" end="00:53:44.280" style="s2">bloodstream and elongates the half-life</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.390" end="00:53:47.430" style="s2">pretty significantly it along gates the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.280" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">half-life of caffeine by that 25% and as</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.430" end="00:53:51.480" style="s2">you look at you know multiple having&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:54.270" style="s2">that means that after about six hours</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.480" end="00:53:56.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually got 50% more caffeine in</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.270" end="00:53:57.810" style="s2">the blood than you do from the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.250" end="00:54:00.150" style="s2">number of milligrams of caffeine not</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.810" end="00:54:02.570" style="s2">down to pterostilbene which means that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.150" end="00:54:06.510" style="s2">you have both more of a delayed onset</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.570" end="00:54:09.180" style="s2">more gradual slower and longer taper so</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.510" end="00:54:11.430" style="s2">you&#39;ve got more consistent peak plasma</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.180" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">levels of caffeine and so we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.430" end="00:54:17.310" style="s2">something that had both a longer effect</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:20.670" style="s2">and less of a crash afterwards and less</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.310" end="00:54:23.700" style="s2">of a you know stimulatory peak and this</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.670" end="00:54:25.620" style="s2">particular delivery mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.700" end="00:54:27.030" style="s2">caffeine was</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.620" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">the best one that we&#39;ve found for this</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.030" end="00:54:31.370" style="s2">purpose and you get the additional</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.810" style="s2">benefits of the pterostilbene which</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.370" end="00:54:36.090" style="s2">there there are many benefits of it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.810" end="00:54:38.010" style="s2">primarily this antioxidant is the main</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.090" end="00:54:39.900" style="s2">reason that&#39;s interesting you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.010" end="00:54:42.180" style="s2">been genetically tested for this and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.900" end="00:54:43.860" style="s2">a fast caffeine oxidizer which means the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.180" end="00:54:46.410" style="s2">caffeine is typically in and out of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.860" end="00:54:47.550" style="s2">bloodstream pretty quickly and that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.410" end="00:54:49.560" style="s2">one thing I noticed about this is it</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.550" end="00:54:51.270" style="s2">seems to like lengthen the half-life of</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.560" end="00:54:53.520" style="s2">caffeine like like without me getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.270" end="00:54:55.590" style="s2">like the the up and then the down I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.520" end="00:54:57.480" style="s2">never actually had caffeine bound to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.590" end="00:54:59.820" style="s2">something like Sarah still being before</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.480" end="00:55:01.380" style="s2">but really interesting effect and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.820" end="00:55:03.030" style="s2">for those of you who have tried caffeine</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.380" end="00:55:04.890" style="s2">all on its own I would recommend that</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.030" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">you you see what it feels like when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.890" end="00:55:08.850" style="s2">get it bound to this caffeine especially</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:11.490" style="s2">if you&#39;re a fast coffee metabolize or</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.850" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">like I am um but before we delve into</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.490" end="00:55:15.660" style="s2">some of these other things you know like</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.720" end="00:55:17.370" style="s2">like neuro vitamins and choline donors</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.660" end="00:55:20.310" style="s2">that you have in here kind of a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.370" end="00:55:22.470" style="s2">picture question for you Daniel what are</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.310" end="00:55:24.900" style="s2">some little-known effects that something</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.470" end="00:55:27.570" style="s2">like a nootropic can have that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.900" end="00:55:29.880" style="s2">might not know about I mean I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.570" end="00:55:31.260" style="s2">for example when I when I took that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.880" end="00:55:35.070" style="s2">god pill all of a sudden I had zero</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.260" end="00:55:37.980" style="s2">desire to procrastinate like I just I</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.070" end="00:55:39.360" style="s2">was ready to jump in to do anything you</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.980" end="00:55:41.880" style="s2">know I know for people who are you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.360" end="00:55:43.470" style="s2">progressing doing taxes or writing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.880" end="00:55:45.480" style="s2">article or cleaning out the desk drawer</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.470" end="00:55:47.340" style="s2">or whatever you know it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.480" end="00:55:50.520" style="s2">nootropics may have an effect there but</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.340" end="00:55:52.110" style="s2">are there other things besides limiting</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.520" end="00:55:55.170" style="s2">procrastination that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.110" end="00:55:58.500" style="s2">lesser-known effects of nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.170" end="00:56:00.930" style="s2">compounds sure leavening procrastination</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.500" end="00:56:02.670" style="s2">is actually really fun example because</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.930" end="00:56:05.640" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t one we intended when we were</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.670" end="00:56:07.560" style="s2">originally developing this formula and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.640" end="00:56:09.090" style="s2">earlier iteration to the formula it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.560" end="00:56:10.590" style="s2">one of the positive side effects that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.090" end="00:56:12.120" style="s2">we&#39;re like well that makes sense and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.590" end="00:56:15.540" style="s2">it&#39;s cool and particularly limiting</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.120" end="00:56:18.360" style="s2">procrastination on things that you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.540" end="00:56:20.220" style="s2">people found dreadful and odious and now</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.360" end="00:56:23.970" style="s2">they had just much more emotional</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.220" end="00:56:25.260" style="s2">neutrality and focus etc in them and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.970" end="00:56:28.230" style="s2">there&#39;s been a very interesting process</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.260" end="00:56:31.110" style="s2">to both hypothesize what things we would</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.230" end="00:56:33.600" style="s2">expect to be affected and then see what</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.110" end="00:56:34.680" style="s2">actually shows up and obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.600" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">going to depend on the particular</p>

<p begin="00:56:39.299" end="00:56:43.339" style="s2">something like aniracetam versus phenyl</p>

<p begin="00:56:50.669" end="00:56:55.769" style="s2">have more anxiety decreasing Enzi lytic</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.209" end="00:56:57.269" style="s2">effects and phenol press attempts and</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:29.549" style="s2">we were most interested by is people</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.649" end="00:57:32.069" style="s2">feeling less emotional upset less what</p>

<p begin="00:57:32.069" end="00:57:37.019" style="s2">that really is not helpful or warranted</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.279" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">without feeling numb so they actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.019" end="00:57:43.649" style="s2">feel more capable more available to</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:45.689" style="s2">positive experiences and negative</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.649" end="00:57:50.429" style="s2">feelings like you know sadness around</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.689" end="00:57:52.739" style="s2">authentic things but not being upset</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.429" end="00:57:53.849" style="s2">unnecessarily by stories they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.739" end="00:57:56.219" style="s2">generating because they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.849" end="00:57:57.749" style="s2">thinking more clearly and so much of our</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.219" end="00:57:59.789" style="s2">emotional process is not the result of</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.749" end="00:58:01.979" style="s2">what&#39;s happening it&#39;s the result of us</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.789" end="00:58:04.049" style="s2">not thinking through multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.979" end="00:58:05.849" style="s2">people&#39;s perspectives and generating</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.049" end="00:58:08.159" style="s2">negative meaning and as someone simply</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.849" end="00:58:10.619" style="s2">able to think more quickly and more</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.159" end="00:58:12.509" style="s2">clearly then they don&#39;t get poor</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.619" end="00:58:14.219" style="s2">thinking generating unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.509" end="00:58:16.519" style="s2">emotional drama and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.219" end="00:58:19.439" style="s2">that&#39;s proven one of the most fun</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.519" end="00:58:21.359" style="s2">experiences people have reported yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.439" end="00:58:23.399" style="s2">and I should know by the way when it</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.359" end="00:58:25.439" style="s2">comes to like vivid dreaming and lucid</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.399" end="00:58:27.209" style="s2">dreaming I don&#39;t recommend at least I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.439" end="00:58:29.669" style="s2">personally wouldn&#39;t take this stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.209" end="00:58:31.559" style="s2">the afternoon because I found that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.669" end="00:58:33.449" style="s2">really produces a very intense</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.559" end="00:58:35.039" style="s2">wakefulness effect what I have found is</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.449" end="00:58:36.209" style="s2">that later on in the day after it you</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.039" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">know you would think it&#39;s out of your</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.209" end="00:58:41.880" style="s2">system I still get a very intense amount</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:44.459" style="s2">of lucid dreaming and vivid dreaming on</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.880" end="00:58:45.539" style="s2">the days that I use this stuff so you</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.459" end="00:58:47.609" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t have to take it right</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.539" end="00:58:50.699" style="s2">before bed you know for example I know</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.609" end="00:58:52.229" style="s2">like alpha brain for example is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.699" end="00:58:53.220" style="s2">popular new topic out there that if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.229" end="00:58:55.410" style="s2">if you take it before</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.220" end="00:58:57.240" style="s2">bed it can cause some pretty intense</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.410" end="00:58:59.460" style="s2">lucid dreaming but this stuff seems to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.240" end="00:59:02.010" style="s2">cause it even if you take it in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.460" end="00:59:04.800" style="s2">morning yeah many of the compounds are</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.010" end="00:59:07.589" style="s2">gonna you know last in the bloodstream</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.800" end="00:59:09.450" style="s2">for a meaningful amount of time and or</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.589" end="00:59:10.650" style="s2">they&#39;re going to affect some processes</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.450" end="00:59:14.880" style="s2">that last for a meaningful amount of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.650" end="00:59:17.940" style="s2">time so this particular acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.880" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">esterase inhibition has a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.940" end="00:59:22.770" style="s2">half-life on it yeah interesting okay so</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got nootropic compounds you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.770" end="00:59:27.569" style="s2">know like like the like the hardening</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:28.890" style="s2">that we talked about and the sera still</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.569" end="00:59:31.079" style="s2">being bound with the caffeine and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.890" end="00:59:32.310" style="s2">then post up team and the huperzine a</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.079" end="00:59:35.400" style="s2">but then you also have these things you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.310" end="00:59:36.569" style="s2">call neuro vitamins and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.400" end="00:59:40.349" style="s2">difference between oral vitamin in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.569" end="00:59:42.390" style="s2">nootropic yeah so like we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.349" end="00:59:43.859" style="s2">earlier neuro vitamin basically we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.390" end="00:59:46.770" style="s2">just talking about vitamins that have</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.859" end="00:59:50.040" style="s2">some effect in the nervous system either</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.770" end="00:59:54.210" style="s2">in converting amino acids into</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.040" end="00:59:56.069" style="s2">neurotransmitters so specifically b6 +</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.210" end="00:59:59.099" style="s2">b6 in the phosphorylated version</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.069" end="01:00:01.470" style="s2">Paradoxal 5 phosphate and vitamin C are</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.099" end="01:00:03.660" style="s2">both critical for converting a phenyl</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.470" end="01:00:07.740" style="s2">alanine and tyrosine into dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.660" end="01:00:11.849" style="s2">converting tryptophan into serotonin and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.740" end="01:00:13.079" style="s2">so these are as for the definition of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.849" end="01:00:14.790" style="s2">vitamins these are things that one has</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.079" end="01:00:16.980" style="s2">to get dietarily the body can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.790" end="01:00:20.849" style="s2">synthesize them and they serve some kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.980" end="01:00:23.849" style="s2">of cofactor role in in some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.849" end="01:00:27.260" style="s2">process right some protein or chemical</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.849" end="01:00:29.940" style="s2">synthesis so we&#39;ve got vitamin D having</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.260" end="01:00:31.740" style="s2">so many important roles throughout the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.940" end="01:00:34.470" style="s2">whole body but particularly for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.740" end="01:00:37.349" style="s2">brain things like myelin synthesis and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.470" end="01:00:40.440" style="s2">we have a particular version of b1</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.349" end="01:00:43.109" style="s2">called a benefit I mean which has a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.440" end="01:00:46.170" style="s2">meaningful neuro protective function and</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.109" end="01:00:48.060" style="s2">specifically in peripheral neurons and a</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.170" end="01:00:51.770" style="s2">version of niacin which is another B</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.060" end="01:00:54.869" style="s2">vitamin niacinamide which helps with</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.770" end="01:00:58.109" style="s2">blood flow and cerebral perfusion but</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.869" end="01:00:59.700" style="s2">specifically nad production and b5 s</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.109" end="01:01:01.410" style="s2">role in acetylcholine and adrenal</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.700" end="01:01:04.680" style="s2">hormone production etc so these are all</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.410" end="01:01:06.630" style="s2">vitamins in particular forms and doses</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.680" end="01:01:09.210" style="s2">that are oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.630" end="01:01:10.859" style="s2">the limiting factor in some of the key</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.210" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">processes that we&#39;re seeking to support</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.859" end="01:01:14.940" style="s2">okay gotcha so so a lot of like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:17.549" style="s2">vitamin B compounds and in specific</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.940" end="01:01:19.589" style="s2">forms that I know are designed for their</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.549" end="01:01:21.479" style="s2">there are neuroprotective effects or</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.589" end="01:01:23.220" style="s2">their anti-inflammatory effects for</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.479" end="01:01:25.589" style="s2">neural tissue or cognitive impairment</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.220" end="01:01:26.759" style="s2">but in addition to the vitamin B complex</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.589" end="01:01:29.279" style="s2">I notice you&#39;ve got the vitamin D</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.759" end="01:01:31.309" style="s2">complex in there but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.279" end="01:01:35.700" style="s2">vitamin D it&#39;s vitamin D uniform called</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.309" end="01:01:39.720" style="s2">micro encapsulated cholecalciferol what</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.700" end="01:01:43.049" style="s2">is that so cholecalciferol just means</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.720" end="01:01:46.140" style="s2">vitamin d3 that&#39;s the scientific name</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.049" end="01:01:48.180" style="s2">for vitamin d3 and micro encapsulated</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.140" end="01:01:50.309" style="s2">micro encapsulation is a process in</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.180" end="01:01:52.470" style="s2">which you have some kind of chemical</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.309" end="01:01:54.299" style="s2">payload that is put in some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.470" end="01:01:57.539" style="s2">encapsulation that&#39;s designed to only</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.299" end="01:01:58.950" style="s2">break down or release at some target so</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.539" end="01:02:01.559" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s trying to get through stomach</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.950" end="01:02:04.170" style="s2">acid like an enteric microencapsulation</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.559" end="01:02:05.910" style="s2">and release in the intestines or move</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.170" end="01:02:09.329" style="s2">through a particular pH or whatever so</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.910" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a delivery mechanism and because</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.329" end="01:02:14.400" style="s2">vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:19.229" style="s2">oftentimes it&#39;ll be actually in a fat</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.400" end="01:02:21.410" style="s2">base but because we&#39;re these these for</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.229" end="01:02:24.150" style="s2">manufacturing reasons these particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.410" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">capsules are powdered then we needed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.150" end="01:02:28.950" style="s2">be able to take the d3 and and stabilize</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:30.869" style="s2">it make sure that it would deliver</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.950" end="01:02:35.009" style="s2">effectively so the micro encapsulation</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.869" end="01:02:37.499" style="s2">is usually something like alginate</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.009" end="01:02:39.630" style="s2">particular extract from algae or</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.499" end="01:02:42.719" style="s2">cellulose that&#39;s simply going to help</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.630" end="01:02:45.029" style="s2">better absorption and delivery of that</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.719" end="01:02:47.099" style="s2">nutrient so it essentially helps to take</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.029" end="01:02:48.599" style="s2">a vitamin that would mostly be fat</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.099" end="01:02:52.079" style="s2">soluble and allows it to be someone</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.599" end="01:02:55.289" style="s2">water soluble in this particular case</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.079" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">yes okay interesting all right so so</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.289" end="01:03:00.239" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your your nootropics and</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:02.130" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your neuro vitamins and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.239" end="01:03:04.940" style="s2">you also have something in there like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.130" end="01:03:06.930" style="s2">class of compounds called neuro</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.940" end="01:03:09.029" style="s2">anti-inflammatories and antioxidants</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.930" end="01:03:10.650" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s not rocket science to</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.029" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">know what would an anti-inflammatory or</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.650" end="01:03:14.940" style="s2">an antioxidant would do in the brain and</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:17.940" style="s2">and some of them they&#39;re relatively</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.940" end="01:03:19.380" style="s2">familiar again like care Seaton for</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.940" end="01:03:20.220" style="s2">example which I know has some really</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.380" end="01:03:22.020" style="s2">cool neural</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.220" end="01:03:23.220" style="s2">affective effects and curcumin which</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.020" end="01:03:24.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked about quite a bit on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.220" end="01:03:26.730" style="s2">show before in terms of its</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.630" end="01:03:29.790" style="s2">anti-inflammatory effects especially for</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.730" end="01:03:30.599" style="s2">neural tissue and in DHA and green tea</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.790" end="01:03:33.900" style="s2">extract</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.599" end="01:03:35.609" style="s2">and even bio pairing or black pepper</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.900" end="01:03:37.590" style="s2">extract which I which I know can help</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.609" end="01:03:39.300" style="s2">with the absorption and utilization of</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.590" end="01:03:45.290" style="s2">curcumin there&#39;s one in there also</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.300" end="01:03:51.090" style="s2">though called bio pqq um what is bio pqq</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.290" end="01:03:54.810" style="s2">yeah so pqq is a active version of coq10</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.090" end="01:03:56.880" style="s2">and so it has a number of important</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.810" end="01:04:00.450" style="s2">effects as a krebs cycle intermediary</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.880" end="01:04:03.480" style="s2">and support and ATP production and you</p>

<p begin="01:04:03.480" end="01:04:07.650" style="s2">you can use pqq they&#39;re progressively</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.460" end="01:04:09.720" style="s2">more potent for certain processes so</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.650" end="01:04:12.800" style="s2">we&#39;re using peak EQ and bio pqq is</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.720" end="01:04:16.020" style="s2">simply a patented brand that has had</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.800" end="01:04:18.990" style="s2">good clinical trials done on it so in</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.020" end="01:04:23.040" style="s2">general if there are companies that have</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.990" end="01:04:25.560" style="s2">made a nutraceutical and have patented a</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.040" end="01:04:28.170" style="s2">process on it that has strong clinical</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.560" end="01:04:30.540" style="s2">trials already done we will use that so</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.170" end="01:04:32.790" style="s2">that we know we have quality control and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.540" end="01:04:35.250" style="s2">can reference the clinical trials and</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.790" end="01:04:41.520" style="s2">you know that we&#39;re done specifically</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.250" end="01:04:44.520" style="s2">and so pqq does a number of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.520" end="01:04:47.580" style="s2">things it&#39;s involved in recycling</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.520" end="01:04:51.359" style="s2">glutathione it affects some growth</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.580" end="01:04:54.060" style="s2">factors it like nerve growth factor</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.359" end="01:04:55.220" style="s2">synth assists but the primary reason</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.060" end="01:04:57.180" style="s2">that we&#39;re using it does have</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.220" end="01:05:00.300" style="s2">anti-inflammatory effects and cytokine</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.180" end="01:05:03.420" style="s2">modulation primary reason is ATP support</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.300" end="01:05:05.700" style="s2">okay got it so you&#39;ve got that in there</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.420" end="01:05:09.030" style="s2">for specifically for ATP support I know</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.700" end="01:05:10.770" style="s2">for example like that&#39;s that&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.030" end="01:05:13.650" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s in the is it called the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.770" end="01:05:17.339" style="s2">upgraded upgraded anti-aging formula</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.650" end="01:05:18.359" style="s2">that bulletproof makes a pqq I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.339" end="01:05:21.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the one that is that other</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.359" end="01:05:24.359" style="s2">upgraded anti-aging or they&#39;re upgraded</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.510" end="01:05:25.920" style="s2">aging formula is oxaloacetate okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.359" end="01:05:27.690" style="s2">that&#39;s right then at the unfair</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.920" end="01:05:29.130" style="s2">advantage which is to buy an unfair</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.690" end="01:05:31.080" style="s2">advantage that&#39;s right unfair advantage</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.130" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">called bio pqq and speaking of which</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.080" end="01:05:33.960" style="s2">like I&#39;ve talked about this before I</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:36.450" style="s2">mean some of these names</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.960" end="01:05:37.920" style="s2">you know and and I love you know I love</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.450" end="01:05:39.390" style="s2">the products that bulletproof makes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.920" end="01:05:41.640" style="s2">a huge fan of their stuff I use their</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.390" end="01:05:43.260" style="s2">their brain octane and I use their their</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.640" end="01:05:45.690" style="s2">chocolate powder and their bars and all</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.260" end="01:05:47.430" style="s2">sorts of stuff but also you know when</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.690" end="01:05:50.010" style="s2">you look at words right like catchy</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.430" end="01:05:51.750" style="s2">phrases like unfair advantage or I mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.010" end="01:05:53.700" style="s2">heck even that the god pill phrases I</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.750" end="01:05:55.020" style="s2">threw around earlier there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.700" end="01:05:56.369" style="s2">an eyebrow that gets raised in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.020" end="01:05:58.770" style="s2">scientific community with stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.369" end="01:06:01.290" style="s2">this with claims like that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.770" end="01:06:03.560" style="s2">curious um in terms of like clinical</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.290" end="01:06:05.369" style="s2">research behind some of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.560" end="01:06:06.930" style="s2">ingredients that specifically be like</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.369" end="01:06:08.849" style="s2">combining all these greens into it into</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.930" end="01:06:11.430" style="s2">a cocktail like you guys are doing at</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.849" end="01:06:14.670" style="s2">neuro hacker collective is there actual</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.430" end="01:06:17.970" style="s2">clinical research behind this stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.670" end="01:06:20.190" style="s2">great I want to go up for one moment and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.970" end="01:06:22.080" style="s2">describe the process of why we brought</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.190" end="01:06:24.270" style="s2">these particular compounds together in</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.080" end="01:06:25.800" style="s2">these doses rather than other things and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.270" end="01:06:28.050" style="s2">is it simply a you know throw in</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.800" end="01:06:30.630" style="s2">everything but the kitchen sink because</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.050" end="01:06:33.000" style="s2">you mentioned a kind of trans</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.630" end="01:06:34.410" style="s2">reductionist whole systems approach the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.000" end="01:06:37.890" style="s2">first thing we did when we were looking</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.410" end="01:06:40.650" style="s2">at development of an entropic like this</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.890" end="01:06:43.230" style="s2">because we were doing specific nootropic</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.650" end="01:06:44.940" style="s2">chemistry with people in integrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.230" end="01:06:47.430" style="s2">medical clinical settings where we had</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.940" end="01:06:49.170" style="s2">their genetics and we had a huge amount</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.430" end="01:06:52.500" style="s2">of blood chemistry on them and could</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.170" end="01:06:54.270" style="s2">customize things like if they were under</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.500" end="01:06:56.690" style="s2">or over meth laters and which</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.270" end="01:06:59.730" style="s2">methylation gene mutations they had and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.690" end="01:07:02.190" style="s2">you know etc this obviously a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.730" end="01:07:05.720" style="s2">different process we wanted to see could</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.190" end="01:07:10.609" style="s2">we could we provide some aspect of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.720" end="01:07:12.750" style="s2">kind of benefit at scale that is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.609" end="01:07:14.790" style="s2">formula and there were some things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.750" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">were so specific like the way we would</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.790" end="01:07:20.190" style="s2">address the folate cycle and many other</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:22.859" style="s2">examples that we just really couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.190" end="01:07:25.560" style="s2">work with those axes without custom</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.859" end="01:07:27.930" style="s2">customized input but we found really</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.560" end="01:07:29.910" style="s2">happily to kind of are surprised that</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.930" end="01:07:31.140" style="s2">there were many things that we could</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.910" end="01:07:33.270" style="s2">work with were the people who kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.140" end="01:07:34.650" style="s2">self-selected being interested in</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.270" end="01:07:36.510" style="s2">something like cognitive enhancement we</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.650" end="01:07:38.790" style="s2">had a very high percentage of people</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.510" end="01:07:40.740" style="s2">that reported and on different</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.790" end="01:07:43.290" style="s2">performative tests responded very well</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.740" end="01:07:45.180" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what this is but what we</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.290" end="01:07:46.470" style="s2">started was saying when people are</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.180" end="01:07:47.369" style="s2">seeking cognitive enhancement what are</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.470" end="01:07:49.230" style="s2">they really seeking</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.369" end="01:07:51.720" style="s2">they probably don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.230" end="01:07:53.880" style="s2">arithmetic processing or digit span by</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.720" end="01:07:56.849" style="s2">themselves they care about a whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.880" end="01:07:59.069" style="s2">complex of cognitive and psychomotor</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.849" end="01:08:01.740" style="s2">things that come together that lead to a</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.069" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">certain set of experience or states and</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.740" end="01:08:05.960" style="s2">capabilities so it&#39;s like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:10.380" style="s2">induce creative productive flow States</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.960" end="01:08:13.259" style="s2">neuro chemically much more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.380" end="01:08:16.230" style="s2">and so it involves focus and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.259" end="01:08:18.120" style="s2">concentration and task switching and</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.230" end="01:08:20.670" style="s2">fluid intelligence and various aspects</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.120" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">of memory memory i/o and long-term</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.670" end="01:08:25.529" style="s2">memory short-term memory digit span etc</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:28.380" style="s2">along with things like Drive and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.529" end="01:08:32.549" style="s2">emotional resilience without creating</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.380" end="01:08:34.679" style="s2">irritability and anxiousness and etc so</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.549" end="01:08:37.080" style="s2">we&#39;re looking that whole complex of what</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.679" end="01:08:38.819" style="s2">side effects are often created by some</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.080" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">smart drugs from the tropics when people</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.819" end="01:08:41.940" style="s2">are pursuing some of the effects and</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:46.380" style="s2">what&#39;s additional effects are actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.940" end="01:08:50.389" style="s2">needed for a synergy of being able to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.380" end="01:08:53.009" style="s2">really meaningful work and feel</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.389" end="01:08:54.060" style="s2">optimized in the process and so we</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.009" end="01:08:56.699" style="s2">started with that kind of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.060" end="01:09:00.270" style="s2">modeling and we looked at for each of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.699" end="01:09:02.219" style="s2">those psycho-emotional cognitive states</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.270" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">or capabilities how they map to</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.219" end="01:09:06.299" style="s2">underlying physiology what&#39;s known about</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:09.359" style="s2">which neurotransmitters which hormones</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.299" end="01:09:12.089" style="s2">which underlying aspects of neural</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.359" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">structure etc are are associated and</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.089" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">this was from any various field of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:18.659" style="s2">integrative medicine or neuroscience etc</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:21.089" style="s2">so we started to model out the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.659" end="01:09:23.040" style="s2">physiologic processes that mediate those</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.089" end="01:09:26.250" style="s2">capabilities and then started to look at</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.040" end="01:09:29.089" style="s2">which chemicals affect those physiologic</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.250" end="01:09:32.069" style="s2">dynamics and then start to explore</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.089" end="01:09:34.679" style="s2">synergies between them and etc so we</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.069" end="01:09:38.009" style="s2">developed a nootropic database of about</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.679" end="01:09:39.900" style="s2">500 chemicals that affected the pathways</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.009" end="01:09:42.449" style="s2">we were looking at and so when we</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.900" end="01:09:44.130" style="s2">narrowed it down to 42 in here obviously</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.449" end="01:09:45.810" style="s2">we&#39;re including a lot of things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.130" end="01:09:48.900" style="s2">also not including a lot of things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.810" end="01:09:52.440" style="s2">including very specific dose ratios</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.900" end="01:09:55.170" style="s2">forms and so most of the ingredients</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.440" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">have clinical trials showing the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.170" end="01:09:59.159" style="s2">specific things they do and then we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:00.610" style="s2">a specific kind of process of hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.159" end="01:10:02.560" style="s2">generation of</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.610" end="01:10:04.900" style="s2">we are seeking to effect positive</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.560" end="01:10:08.110" style="s2">synergies and then we&#39;ve done about</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.900" end="01:10:10.150" style="s2">three years of you know preclinical data</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.110" end="01:10:12.400" style="s2">where we don&#39;t have where we haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.150" end="01:10:13.630" style="s2">formal placebo control etc and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:16.840" style="s2">just moving into doing clinical trials</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.630" end="01:10:17.890" style="s2">right now we have a partner in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.840" end="01:10:19.810" style="s2">neural biology department at Stanford</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.890" end="01:10:23.460" style="s2">that&#39;s helping with it and a number of</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.810" end="01:10:26.260" style="s2">other great science partners outside of</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.460" end="01:10:27.730" style="s2">neuro hacker as well as the team inside</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.260" end="01:10:30.130" style="s2">of neuro hacker and so we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.730" end="01:10:33.460" style="s2">engaging on our clinical trials we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.130" end="01:10:35.470" style="s2">also developing an online assessment app</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.460" end="01:10:37.270" style="s2">that can assess various cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.470" end="01:10:38.830" style="s2">capabilities like you&#39;re mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.270" end="01:10:40.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a few apps that do but again</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.830" end="01:10:43.030" style="s2">we&#39;re going for comprehensive &#39;ti and</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.210" end="01:10:46.180" style="s2">the can assess psycho structural and</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.030" end="01:10:47.680" style="s2">psycho kind of emotional states so that</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.180" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">people will be able to use that app to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.680" end="01:10:52.750" style="s2">test how this is working but also that</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:53.890" style="s2">they could test anything they could take</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.750" end="01:10:56.140" style="s2">other nootropics they could start</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.890" end="01:10:59.410" style="s2">meditating exercising and just really be</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.140" end="01:11:03.190" style="s2">able to have a available resource for</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.410" end="01:11:05.200" style="s2">tracking psycho cognitive effects better</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.190" end="01:11:06.490" style="s2">right right so it&#39;s basically like like</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.200" end="01:11:08.680" style="s2">a whole bunch of ingredients that have</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.490" end="01:11:11.410" style="s2">pretty good robust empirical basis for</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.680" end="01:11:12.730" style="s2">support and various degrees of</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.410" end="01:11:14.530" style="s2">laboratory and clinical research</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.730" end="01:11:16.600" style="s2">supporting their safety and their</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.530" end="01:11:19.510" style="s2">efficacy but in terms of like putting</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.600" end="01:11:21.130" style="s2">all this together I mean to be frank it</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.510" end="01:11:22.990" style="s2">sounds like it&#39;s still you know I</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.130" end="01:11:24.790" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually taken this and put it</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.990" end="01:11:26.410" style="s2">through like you know double-blind peer</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.790" end="01:11:27.550" style="s2">reviewed research quite yet you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.410" end="01:11:29.800" style="s2">kind of going off of each of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.550" end="01:11:31.390" style="s2">individualize ingredients yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.800" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">like I said we&#39;re in the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.390" end="01:11:35.290" style="s2">doing that but we haven&#39;t got all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:37.210" style="s2">results back yet but it&#39;ll be soon our</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.290" end="01:11:40.180" style="s2">first pilot trial will come back soon</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.210" end="01:11:41.680" style="s2">what we did in the you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.180" end="01:11:43.390" style="s2">preclinical phase was we had several</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.680" end="01:11:45.760" style="s2">hundred people for a few years going</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.390" end="01:11:47.710" style="s2">through the trials where they again this</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.760" end="01:11:49.840" style="s2">was not properly blinded but they were</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.710" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">using quantified mind or Cambridge&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.840" end="01:11:53.350" style="s2">online cognitive assessment or various</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:55.930" style="s2">cognitive assessments like that as well</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.350" end="01:12:00.280" style="s2">as structured subjective reporting and</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.930" end="01:12:03.040" style="s2">so we did get input on and specific data</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.280" end="01:12:04.990" style="s2">on what was changing and in what</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.040" end="01:12:07.870" style="s2">percentage of people and that was enough</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.990" end="01:12:10.660" style="s2">to develop it to kind of the place that</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.870" end="01:12:13.510" style="s2">we have and now moving into formal</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.660" end="01:12:14.530" style="s2">clinical process okay got it cool well I</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.510" end="01:12:17.560" style="s2">can speak</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.530" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">an N equals one experience that it it</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.560" end="01:12:22.540" style="s2">seems to work quite well for me and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:25.420" style="s2">suppose anyone else could try it as well</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.540" end="01:12:26.620" style="s2">oh and by the way again I&#39;ll mention the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.420" end="01:12:28.540" style="s2">show notes just so you guys know that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.620" end="01:12:30.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a phat discount on this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.540" end="01:12:32.410" style="s2">over in the show notes just go to Ben</p>

<p begin="01:12:39.640" end="01:12:42.820" style="s2">ahead and pick because you just said N</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.350" end="01:12:43.810" style="s2">equals one this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.820" end="01:12:46.390" style="s2">interesting things we asked about</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.810" end="01:12:48.940" style="s2">clinical trials in clinical trial says</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.390" end="01:12:51.970" style="s2">does this particular chemical compound</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.940" end="01:12:55.480" style="s2">process therapy do something across some</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.970" end="01:12:57.340" style="s2">randomized database more than the</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.480" end="01:12:59.770" style="s2">placebo does it&#39;s a it&#39;s a meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.340" end="01:13:01.330" style="s2">test but obviously some people are on</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.770" end="01:13:02.650" style="s2">one end of the bell curve effect and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.330" end="01:13:04.810" style="s2">some people are on the other end and</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.650" end="01:13:06.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of variables as to</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.810" end="01:13:08.200" style="s2">why that are just statistically averaged</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.520" end="01:13:10.750" style="s2">into that bell curve and when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.200" end="01:13:13.900" style="s2">trying to do personalized medicine where</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.750" end="01:13:15.400" style="s2">we would or personalized optimization</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.900" end="01:13:17.620" style="s2">where we would do something different</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.400" end="01:13:20.290" style="s2">for you than we would for anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.620" end="01:13:21.370" style="s2">then clinical trials are not there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.290" end="01:13:22.570" style="s2">still an important part of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.370" end="01:13:25.660" style="s2">overarching process but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.570" end="01:13:28.510" style="s2">adequate for N equals one optimization</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.660" end="01:13:31.390" style="s2">and so quality is our first product to</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.510" end="01:13:33.370" style="s2">go to market but more personalized</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.390" end="01:13:36.340" style="s2">versions of it moving towards full</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.370" end="01:13:38.740" style="s2">personalization and then not just</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.340" end="01:13:41.320" style="s2">quality but many different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.740" end="01:13:44.170" style="s2">neuro technologies coming together our</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.320" end="01:13:45.820" style="s2">goal is moving towards being able to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.170" end="01:13:48.670" style="s2">appropriate synthesis of all the</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.820" end="01:13:51.310" style="s2">biometrics and psycho metrics that</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.670" end="01:13:52.540" style="s2">someone has to gain better insights into</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.310" end="01:13:55.300" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in their system and</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.540" end="01:13:58.210" style="s2">personalized optimization recommendation</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.300" end="01:13:59.380" style="s2">which is an underlying AI problem and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.210" end="01:14:01.990" style="s2">that&#39;s really what no hacker collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.380" end="01:14:04.090" style="s2">is all about is how do we synthesize the</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.990" end="01:14:05.980" style="s2">entire space right vet first and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.090" end="01:14:07.720" style="s2">synthesize the space of everything</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.980" end="01:14:09.220" style="s2">that&#39;s actually meaningful to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.720" end="01:14:11.410" style="s2">affect people&#39;s cognitive psych</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.220" end="01:14:16.390" style="s2">emotional mind brain interactions and</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.410" end="01:14:18.820" style="s2">then based on the have about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.390" end="01:14:21.400" style="s2">actually going on for them personalize</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.820" end="01:14:24.700" style="s2">those recommendations mm-hmm got it cool</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.400" end="01:14:26.350" style="s2">I like it I&#39;m all about mini testing as</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.700" end="01:14:27.400" style="s2">you go through the stuff and again like</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.350" end="01:14:28.720" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got access</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.400" end="01:14:31.330" style="s2">- to some of those neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.720" end="01:14:33.850" style="s2">software or the the muse headband or you</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.330" end="01:14:35.200" style="s2">know and back training or CNS tap test</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.850" end="01:14:37.140" style="s2">or anything like that it&#39;s fun to play</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.200" end="01:14:39.640" style="s2">with this stuff in that vein as well um</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.140" end="01:14:40.990" style="s2">neural minerals you have neuro minerals</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.640" end="01:14:43.570" style="s2">in there as well like lithium orotate</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.990" end="01:14:44.500" style="s2">and magnesium three and eight and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.570" end="01:14:46.480" style="s2">zinc picolinate</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.500" end="01:14:48.850" style="s2">um one of the things I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.480" end="01:14:50.110" style="s2">about Daniel because I used magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.850" end="01:14:51.940" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve used it in the past for</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.110" end="01:14:53.500" style="s2">you know helping with sleep before bed</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.940" end="01:14:55.240" style="s2">or helping to have a nice smooth bowel</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.500" end="01:14:57.010" style="s2">movement the next morning you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.240" end="01:14:58.510" style="s2">form of magnesium called magnesium three</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.010" end="01:15:00.760" style="s2">and eight in there and most mostly what</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.510" end="01:15:03.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve used has been magnesium citrate why</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.760" end="01:15:05.680" style="s2">have you used magnesium three and eight</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.010" end="01:15:07.450" style="s2">as your primary form of a mineral and</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.680" end="01:15:09.730" style="s2">then kind of a bigger picture question</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.450" end="01:15:13.240" style="s2">why minerals in general as an inclusion</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.730" end="01:15:15.310" style="s2">in this compound yeah so magnesium three</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.240" end="01:15:17.530" style="s2">and eight is magnesium bound to</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.310" end="01:15:19.510" style="s2">threonine and just like magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.530" end="01:15:21.600" style="s2">citrate is bound the citric acid there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.510" end="01:15:24.430" style="s2">many different forms that you can bind</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.600" end="01:15:26.380" style="s2">magnesium to that will either have</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.430" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">better or worse absorption overall or</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.380" end="01:15:31.240" style="s2">more specific absorption targeting some</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:33.370" style="s2">of the many different things that mag</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.240" end="01:15:38.050" style="s2">needs and this would be true for any</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.370" end="01:15:40.180" style="s2">mineral and so mag teen which is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.050" end="01:15:42.040" style="s2">first connect patented version of</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.180" end="01:15:45.910" style="s2">magnesium three and eight had very</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.040" end="01:15:48.190" style="s2">interesting and very unique trials</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.910" end="01:15:49.720" style="s2">showing increased brain levels of</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.190" end="01:15:52.060" style="s2">magnesium specifically cerebrospinal</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.720" end="01:15:54.280" style="s2">fluid levels of magnesium that were</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.060" end="01:15:58.000" style="s2">tested in terms of double-blind placebo</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.280" end="01:15:59.380" style="s2">control and actually for this since we</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.000" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">were we weren&#39;t testing subjective</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.380" end="01:16:03.850" style="s2">effects they were testing specifically</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.600" end="01:16:06.340" style="s2">cerebrospinal fluid levels and placebo</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.850" end="01:16:08.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t matter that much but contesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.340" end="01:16:11.260" style="s2">it against other forms of magnesium and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.200" end="01:16:13.930" style="s2">found increased elevation of</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.260" end="01:16:16.540" style="s2">cerebrospinal magnesium levels that no</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.930" end="01:16:18.310" style="s2">other form of magnesium tested had been</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.540" end="01:16:21.820" style="s2">able to show so when we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.310" end="01:16:24.550" style="s2">specifically at magnesium&#39;s effect for</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.820" end="01:16:26.220" style="s2">neural health magnesium three and eight</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.550" end="01:16:28.810" style="s2">seems to be the best form magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.220" end="01:16:30.370" style="s2">currently known for increasing</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.810" end="01:16:32.410" style="s2">cerebrospinal and brain levels of</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.370" end="01:16:35.560" style="s2">magnesium now that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.410" end="01:16:37.840" style="s2">magnesium citrate or other forms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.560" end="01:16:40.000" style="s2">magnesium won&#39;t have additional benefits</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.840" end="01:16:40.739" style="s2">we think that topical magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.000" end="01:16:43.469" style="s2">magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.739" end="01:16:48.059" style="s2">oil is really beneficial because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.469" end="01:16:50.099" style="s2">actually got rate limiting factors in</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.059" end="01:16:51.749" style="s2">terms of just GI absorption of magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.099" end="01:16:55.230" style="s2">in any form so going through other</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.749" end="01:16:58.019" style="s2">mechanisms is good but this one is is</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.230" end="01:16:59.760" style="s2">very interesting and it seems to be from</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.019" end="01:17:02.550" style="s2">everything we know so far unique and</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.760" end="01:17:05.099" style="s2">it&#39;s neurologic benefits yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.550" end="01:17:06.960" style="s2">minerals in general are basically to to</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.099" end="01:17:08.969" style="s2">do things like modulate you know some of</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.960" end="01:17:11.909" style="s2">the cytokines and the e okosan oit&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.969" end="01:17:14.159" style="s2">that are created during neuro normal</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.909" end="01:17:14.969" style="s2">neural processing and I know there are</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.159" end="01:17:17.239" style="s2">there are other things that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.969" end="01:17:19.559" style="s2">necessary for like redox reactions and</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.239" end="01:17:21.210" style="s2">cellular neural metabolism and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.559" end="01:17:22.889" style="s2">the other things you&#39;d mean minerals for</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.210" end="01:17:24.690" style="s2">I just don&#39;t see them in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.889" end="01:17:26.610" style="s2">nootropic compounds and especially this</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.690" end="01:17:28.619" style="s2">form of magnesium I&#39;m totally on board</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.610" end="01:17:30.150" style="s2">with you I use in addition to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.619" end="01:17:32.579" style="s2">magnesium citrate that I mentioned like</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.150" end="01:17:35.159" style="s2">a transdermal topical magnesium</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.579" end="01:17:36.239" style="s2">especially on sore muscles but I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.159" end="01:17:38.639" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that you guys have</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.239" end="01:17:41.909" style="s2">magnesium in this compound as well know</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.639" end="01:17:44.309" style="s2">not to get too too nitty gritty but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.909" end="01:17:46.349" style="s2">got a couple of other questions about</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.309" end="01:17:49.530" style="s2">ingredients than like a usage question</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.349" end="01:17:51.809" style="s2">for you amino acids you you have a whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.530" end="01:17:53.460" style="s2">broad spectrum of amino acids in there</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.809" end="01:17:55.199" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s it&#39;s much of a</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.460" end="01:17:58.469" style="s2">secret any longer that amino acids are</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.199" end="01:18:00.179" style="s2">used as neurotransmitter precursors and</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.469" end="01:18:01.949" style="s2">so if you&#39;re low in protein low in amino</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.179" end="01:18:03.570" style="s2">acids especially if you&#39;re vegan or</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.949" end="01:18:05.400" style="s2">vegetarian and I know amino acids are</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.570" end="01:18:08.070" style="s2">crucial but then you also have something</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.400" end="01:18:10.289" style="s2">in there called choline donors choline</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.070" end="01:18:12.360" style="s2">donors why is it that someone want to</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.289" end="01:18:14.670" style="s2">include a choline donor when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.360" end="01:18:16.920" style="s2">taking something like a blend of amino</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.670" end="01:18:18.050" style="s2">acids and minerals and nootropics and</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.920" end="01:18:21.900" style="s2">things of that nature</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.050" end="01:18:23.360" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a number of different</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.900" end="01:18:25.079" style="s2">things we&#39;re trying to affect here so</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.360" end="01:18:28.769" style="s2">neurotransmitters are one of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.079" end="01:18:30.510" style="s2">significant effects specifically for you</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.769" end="01:18:34.820" style="s2">know the immediate effects and affecting</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.510" end="01:18:36.719" style="s2">things like ngf and BDNF for us</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.820" end="01:18:38.010" style="s2">neurogenesis are some of the longer-term</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.719" end="01:18:40.860" style="s2">effects there&#39;s many different pathways</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.010" end="01:18:42.690" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to affect one of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.860" end="01:18:45.900" style="s2">neurotransmitters that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.690" end="01:18:47.699" style="s2">meaningfully involved in memory and</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.900" end="01:18:51.840" style="s2">cognitive function is the acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.699" end="01:18:54.030" style="s2">pathway and so we have various choline</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.840" end="01:18:54.569" style="s2">donors which are actually providing the</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.030" end="01:18:56.549" style="s2">coal</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.569" end="01:19:00.149" style="s2">that gets acetylated into acetyl choline</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.549" end="01:19:02.489" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice we also have acetyl donors</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.149" end="01:19:04.799" style="s2">both in the acetyl carnitine and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.489" end="01:19:07.559" style="s2">acetyl tyrosine where the amino acid has</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.799" end="01:19:09.299" style="s2">its own benefit and we&#39;re making sure</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.559" end="01:19:10.229" style="s2">that the acetyl groups aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.299" end="01:19:13.849" style="s2">be the rate limiting factor for</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.229" end="01:19:16.439" style="s2">acetylcholine production and then the</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.849" end="01:19:19.769" style="s2">the rest of that acetylcholine pathway</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.439" end="01:19:21.780" style="s2">involves things like you know b5 is</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.769" end="01:19:24.510" style="s2">involved in the actual production of</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.780" end="01:19:27.059" style="s2">acetylcholine the acetylcholine esterase</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.510" end="01:19:29.909" style="s2">inhibitors like huperzine a make sure</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.059" end="01:19:31.679" style="s2">that the acetylcholine and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.909" end="01:19:34.229" style="s2">presynaptic neuron can actually get</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.679" end="01:19:36.659" style="s2">across the synapse effectively and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.229" end="01:19:37.949" style="s2">the NMDA modulator so new pepped in</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.659" end="01:19:41.069" style="s2">particular but there&#39;s a few other</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.949" end="01:19:43.469" style="s2">things increase the postsynaptic neurons</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.069" end="01:19:45.089" style="s2">ability to receive and process the</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.469" end="01:19:48.059" style="s2">acetylcholine all of this is part of</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.089" end="01:19:51.179" style="s2">what we call a comprehend see the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.059" end="01:19:52.709" style="s2">choline pathway support and the various</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.179" end="01:19:55.859" style="s2">different choline donors so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.709" end="01:19:58.549" style="s2">like city choline and alpha GPC and</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.859" end="01:20:01.469" style="s2">central Phenix seen but also things like</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.549" end="01:20:03.089" style="s2">uridine uridine has a number of</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.469" end="01:20:05.579" style="s2">interesting effects but it one of them</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.089" end="01:20:08.179" style="s2">is that it does convert into city</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.579" end="01:20:11.069" style="s2">choline we have this blend because</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.179" end="01:20:12.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve got various peak plasma times and</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.069" end="01:20:13.409" style="s2">you when you want a more kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.030" end="01:20:15.059" style="s2">consistent peak plasma over a longer</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.409" end="01:20:17.459" style="s2">period of time you factor that and</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.059" end="01:20:20.129" style="s2">you&#39;ve also got kind of differential</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.459" end="01:20:21.629" style="s2">delivery where both alpha GPC and city</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.129" end="01:20:24.689" style="s2">choline are gonna affect peripheral</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.629" end="01:20:26.599" style="s2">nerves more than central phenoxy ins</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.689" end="01:20:31.010" style="s2">effect on central nervous system and so</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.599" end="01:20:31.010" style="s2">this is all part of what we would call</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.129" end="01:20:35.579" style="s2">acetylcholine precursors and support</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.299" end="01:20:36.869" style="s2">okay got it so so it&#39;s the same reason I</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.579" end="01:20:38.819" style="s2">mean you you hear about things like</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.869" end="01:20:41.489" style="s2">choline turnover and about how you can</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.819" end="01:20:42.749" style="s2">get excessively fatigued if you try to</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.489" end="01:20:44.639" style="s2">get your brain to fire too quickly</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.749" end="01:20:48.479" style="s2">without replenishing it with things like</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.639" end="01:20:49.530" style="s2">alpha GPC or choline and all you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.479" end="01:20:51.239" style="s2">is you&#39;ve taken a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.530" end="01:20:53.249" style="s2">different forms of choline like the side</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.239" end="01:20:55.559" style="s2">of choline and the central Phenix scene</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.249" end="01:20:57.149" style="s2">and the alpha GPC and put them all</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.559" end="01:20:59.579" style="s2">together in there so you&#39;re essentially</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.149" end="01:21:00.749" style="s2">just like covering all the choline bases</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.579" end="01:21:02.949" style="s2">although all that would be called the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.749" end="01:21:05.690" style="s2">cholinergic bases</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.949" end="01:21:09.550" style="s2">right now there&#39;s obviously many famous</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.690" end="01:21:11.449" style="s2">forms of choline like dmae or</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.550" end="01:21:12.949" style="s2">phosphatidylcholine or whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.449" end="01:21:15.170" style="s2">we&#39;re not using in here for various</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.949" end="01:21:17.599" style="s2">reasons and then the specific doses</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.170" end="01:21:19.639" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice that the city choline or</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.599" end="01:21:21.860" style="s2">the alpha GPC are lower doses than if</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.639" end="01:21:23.449" style="s2">people were using those by themselves</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.860" end="01:21:25.849" style="s2">because we&#39;re looking at the entire</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.449" end="01:21:29.869" style="s2">choline load to not make people over</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.849" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">cholinergic factoring all of them so yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.869" end="01:21:36.369" style="s2">this I would say it&#39;s 101 of no tropics</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:39.199" style="s2">to look at the acetylcholine pathway and</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.369" end="01:21:42.050" style="s2">whenever someone starts to do a racetam</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.199" end="01:21:46.639" style="s2">of some kind or racetam like compound</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.050" end="01:21:49.070" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a NMDA modulator for</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.639" end="01:21:52.219" style="s2">a single choline uptake the first kind</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.070" end="01:21:55.310" style="s2">of this principle of stacking is usually</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.219" end="01:21:57.170" style="s2">have some form of choline donor that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.310" end="01:21:59.239" style="s2">bound to it so something like central</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.170" end="01:22:01.369" style="s2">phenoxy NAND new pep together is a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.239" end="01:22:03.099" style="s2">classic stack but then as you start to</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.369" end="01:22:06.800" style="s2">add</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.099" end="01:22:08.840" style="s2">uridine and b5 and huperzine a you just</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.800" end="01:22:10.610" style="s2">get a more comprehensive effect right</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.840" end="01:22:12.020" style="s2">and I know in many cases you know people</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.610" end="01:22:13.670" style="s2">will like to consume you know a</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.020" end="01:22:15.590" style="s2">nootropic compound like this with a</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.670" end="01:22:16.880" style="s2">fatty rich meal you know to help out</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.590" end="01:22:19.130" style="s2">with some of those choline precursors</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.880" end="01:22:20.900" style="s2">and absorption in general you know like</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.130" end="01:22:22.219" style="s2">have it with eggs or have it you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.900" end="01:22:23.719" style="s2">like in my case with out with a little</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.219" end="01:22:26.690" style="s2">smoothie with some coconut milk and</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.719" end="01:22:28.369" style="s2">seeds and nuts but the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.690" end="01:22:31.489" style="s2">and I think kind of the unique thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.369" end="01:22:33.770" style="s2">about this qualia supplement is there</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.489" end="01:22:36.020" style="s2">are two bottles that you get when you</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.770" end="01:22:39.199" style="s2">buy it you get a what&#39;s called a step 1</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.020" end="01:22:41.810" style="s2">and a step 2 and only step 2 is to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.199" end="01:22:44.300" style="s2">taken with food I&#39;m curious what why&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.810" end="01:22:46.489" style="s2">you why&#39;d you switch things up as far as</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.300" end="01:22:49.849" style="s2">as far as the bottling goes in the need</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.489" end="01:22:53.510" style="s2">for step 1 and step 2 yeah it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.849" end="01:22:55.090" style="s2">originally that way in terms of before</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.510" end="01:22:57.889" style="s2">it was productized and we were in</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.090" end="01:22:59.929" style="s2">development but as you notice there</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.889" end="01:23:01.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of ingredients and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.929" end="01:23:03.860" style="s2">significant quantity on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.610" end="01:23:07.599" style="s2">ingredients so there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.860" end="01:23:10.639" style="s2">total grams so average dose being three</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.599" end="01:23:14.599" style="s2">step one and five relatively large</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.639" end="01:23:16.429" style="s2">tablets of step two now that was just</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.599" end="01:23:19.749" style="s2">what it actually took to get the</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.429" end="01:23:23.539" style="s2">kind of effects we were looking for and</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.749" end="01:23:26.179" style="s2">so part of the reason that we split it</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.539" end="01:23:28.579" style="s2">up it has to do with GI absorption</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.179" end="01:23:31.360" style="s2">specifically so there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.579" end="01:23:33.769" style="s2">compounds that actually absorb faster</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.360" end="01:23:35.449" style="s2">without food because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.769" end="01:23:37.639" style="s2">competing for absorption site in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.449" end="01:23:38.719" style="s2">intestines and they&#39;re the compounds</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.639" end="01:23:40.099" style="s2">that are going to start producing the</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.719" end="01:23:42.559" style="s2">immediate effects that people usually</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.099" end="01:23:45.229" style="s2">want to notice quickly so most of those</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.559" end="01:23:47.889" style="s2">are in step one and step two are things</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.229" end="01:23:51.650" style="s2">that either absorb better with food or</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.889" end="01:23:54.499" style="s2">could otherwise create nausea if not</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.650" end="01:23:56.360" style="s2">taken with food and so when the whole</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.499" end="01:23:59.090" style="s2">thing was combined you either take it</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.360" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">all with lower absorption on the things</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.090" end="01:24:03.769" style="s2">that are in step one and slower</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:05.900" style="s2">immediate kind of effects or run a risk</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.769" end="01:24:07.999" style="s2">of nausea taking it all not with food</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.900" end="01:24:10.820" style="s2">and decreased absorption on something so</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.999" end="01:24:12.499" style="s2">this was the best way that we could</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.820" end="01:24:15.260" style="s2">support absorption of the whole stack</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.499" end="01:24:17.209" style="s2">okay got it so you take basically the</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.260" end="01:24:18.079" style="s2">the rule is on this stuff and then this</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.209" end="01:24:20.119" style="s2">is the way diving usually works</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.079" end="01:24:22.459" style="s2">perfectly you know I I know that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.119" end="01:24:24.530" style="s2">dosages vary widely you guys have dosage</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.459" end="01:24:25.760" style="s2">recommendations on your website and on</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.530" end="01:24:28.880" style="s2">the back of the bottle but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.760" end="01:24:31.070" style="s2">taking four to five of step one when I</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.880" end="01:24:33.139" style="s2">get up in the morning and then later on</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.070" end="01:24:35.269" style="s2">with breakfast anywhere between</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.139" end="01:24:39.199" style="s2">depending on the the day&#39;s level of</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.269" end="01:24:40.820" style="s2">activity three to five of the step two</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.199" end="01:24:42.139" style="s2">with actually I think it took four this</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.820" end="01:24:44.090" style="s2">morning because I knew I&#39;d be talking to</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.139" end="01:24:46.340" style="s2">you and when I talked to smart people I</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.090" end="01:24:50.510" style="s2">I need some kind of advantage to be able</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.340" end="01:24:52.039" style="s2">to keep up with with with you guys so so</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.510" end="01:24:54.559" style="s2">yeah that that&#39;s interesting the one-two</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.039" end="01:24:55.909" style="s2">combo approach the doses are obviously</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.559" end="01:24:57.800" style="s2">going to be very different based on</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.909" end="01:25:00.260" style="s2">people&#39;s sensitivity based on their body</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.800" end="01:25:02.630" style="s2">weight based on the desired level of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.260" end="01:25:04.789" style="s2">effect they want to have based on if</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.630" end="01:25:07.249" style="s2">they have used other know tropics or</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.789" end="01:25:09.380" style="s2">stimulants and in the past where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.249" end="01:25:11.300" style="s2">actually you know maybe created certain</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.380" end="01:25:13.309" style="s2">kinds of dependence so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.300" end="01:25:15.679" style="s2">factors that are involved we have a</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.309" end="01:25:17.179" style="s2">ratio that is based on if it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.679" end="01:25:18.949" style="s2">split into one and two if it was one</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.179" end="01:25:21.349" style="s2">stack what would it be and so three of</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.949" end="01:25:25.030" style="s2">step one and five of step two represents</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.349" end="01:25:29.520" style="s2">that ratio and kind of average dosage</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.030" end="01:25:31.770" style="s2">and people can either start there and</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.520" end="01:25:33.810" style="s2">adjust accordingly or if there are</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.770" end="01:25:36.660" style="s2">sensitivity concerns to start on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.810" end="01:25:39.350" style="s2">lowest side and then progressively move</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.660" end="01:25:42.630" style="s2">up as they feel comfortable with it and</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.350" end="01:25:44.910" style="s2">one of the reasons you might use less of</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.630" end="01:25:48.720" style="s2">step two is that many of the coaling</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.910" end="01:25:50.790" style="s2">donors are in there and there are some</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.720" end="01:25:53.940" style="s2">people that are much more sensitive to</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.790" end="01:25:55.080" style="s2">getting over cholinergic and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.940" end="01:25:57.000" style="s2">one of those aspects where you really</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.080" end="01:25:58.230" style="s2">want to get into personalization some</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.000" end="01:25:59.670" style="s2">people really don&#39;t need much than weave</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.230" end="01:26:02.580" style="s2">calling donors at all and other people</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.670" end="01:26:04.860" style="s2">benefit from higher doses profoundly and</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.580" end="01:26:08.270" style="s2">so one of the things that we are working</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.860" end="01:26:10.950" style="s2">on and we&#39;ll be developing and releasing</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.270" end="01:26:14.280" style="s2">soon are before we get to full</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.950" end="01:26:18.000" style="s2">customization based off of genetics and</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.280" end="01:26:19.710" style="s2">clinical chemistry we are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.000" end="01:26:21.960" style="s2">doing kind of phenotype specific</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.710" end="01:26:23.760" style="s2">versions that look at in general under</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.960" end="01:26:25.710" style="s2">or over methylating under or over</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.760" end="01:26:30.240" style="s2">cholinergic under over catecholamine</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.710" end="01:26:33.240" style="s2">Uruk and this will provide better</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.240" end="01:26:36.540" style="s2">effects for more people but these are</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.240" end="01:26:38.610" style="s2">steps got it got it I&#39;m in a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.540" end="01:26:40.410" style="s2">the questions is this okay like if if</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.610" end="01:26:42.450" style="s2">somebody competes in like a sanction</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.410" end="01:26:45.090" style="s2">Organization sport like like a wada</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.450" end="01:26:45.960" style="s2">sanctions board or you saw the sanction</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.090" end="01:26:46.910" style="s2">supporters sent you know something</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.960" end="01:26:49.350" style="s2">sanctioned by the world anti-doping</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.910" end="01:26:51.750" style="s2">Association or you know the Olympics or</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.350" end="01:26:53.310" style="s2">something like that um there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.750" end="01:26:56.790" style="s2">a whole like cocktail you know whole</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.310" end="01:26:58.470" style="s2">shotgun of stuff in here um is it</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.790" end="01:27:00.710" style="s2">actually safe like is acceptable to take</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.470" end="01:27:05.430" style="s2">if you&#39;re competing in a sport like that</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.710" end="01:27:07.710" style="s2">very possibly not so for instance</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.430" end="01:27:10.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a small dose of DHEA and I know</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.710" end="01:27:13.080" style="s2">DHEA is on the banned list for a number</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.830" end="01:27:14.700" style="s2">of organizations and sports it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.080" end="01:27:18.180" style="s2">for other organizations and sports so</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.700" end="01:27:20.250" style="s2">this is not something that we keep an</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.180" end="01:27:22.170" style="s2">updated list on on our website so I</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.250" end="01:27:24.480" style="s2">would say anyone who is being tested</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.170" end="01:27:26.580" style="s2">should look at what the banned list</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.480" end="01:27:27.780" style="s2">ingredients are for them and then check</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.580" end="01:27:31.200" style="s2">to make sure this is right for them</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.780" end="01:27:33.840" style="s2">again we will in the future have</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.200" end="01:27:35.880" style="s2">versions that don&#39;t have DHEA don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.840" end="01:27:38.490" style="s2">caffeine but when we were wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.880" end="01:27:41.160" style="s2">release you know an initial product that</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.490" end="01:27:42.550" style="s2">would be the most well tolerated and</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.160" end="01:27:44.320" style="s2">effective across the largest</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.550" end="01:27:48.070" style="s2">number of people this was the best</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.320" end="01:27:51.010" style="s2">starting place so this is not going this</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.070" end="01:27:53.260" style="s2">is not going to as far as we would have</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.010" end="01:27:55.630" style="s2">any reason to believe show up on any</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.260" end="01:27:58.929" style="s2">kind of illegal narcotics drug testing</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.630" end="01:28:01.000" style="s2">there are no illegal narcotics but as</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.929" end="01:28:03.309" style="s2">far as anti-doping one should look into</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.000" end="01:28:05.699" style="s2">that themselves yeah I actually think</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.309" end="01:28:08.500" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of sad because like DHEA is</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.699" end="01:28:10.239" style="s2">it&#39;s not an anabolic steroid it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.500" end="01:28:11.980" style="s2">act like an anabolic steroid it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.239" end="01:28:13.570" style="s2">free of side effects it doesn&#39;t produce</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.980" end="01:28:16.119" style="s2">any of the negative side effects of an</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.570" end="01:28:19.449" style="s2">anabolic steroid and I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.119" end="01:28:21.309" style="s2">understand why wada would would ban</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.449" end="01:28:23.739" style="s2">something like that that you find in</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.309" end="01:28:26.349" style="s2">freakin like raw butter and cod liver</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.739" end="01:28:28.480" style="s2">oil and red palm oil and pumpkin seeds</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.349" end="01:28:29.920" style="s2">and ghee I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.480" end="01:28:32.290" style="s2">interesting that they would that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.920" end="01:28:33.969" style="s2">would straight-up say something like</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.290" end="01:28:35.590" style="s2">that when I know they&#39;re trying to keep</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.969" end="01:28:38.440" style="s2">people from using a cocktail of</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.590" end="01:28:41.199" style="s2">potentially dangerous anabolic agents</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.440" end="01:28:42.790" style="s2">but to me that the DHEA part of things</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.199" end="01:28:45.670" style="s2">is a bit silly especially when you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.790" end="01:28:48.429" style="s2">folks can can wander into Walgreens and</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.670" end="01:28:50.710" style="s2">get you know enormous amounts of DHEA</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.429" end="01:28:52.630" style="s2">just right off the shelf and make a lot</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.710" end="01:28:56.349" style="s2">of a lot of folks don&#39;t really realize</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.630" end="01:28:57.790" style="s2">that sometimes sometimes the the Olympic</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.349" end="01:29:00.159" style="s2">anti-doping laboratories in the world</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.790" end="01:29:02.710" style="s2">anti-doping agencies and you know some</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.159" end="01:29:04.389" style="s2">of these agencies they they they paint</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.710" end="01:29:07.030" style="s2">with a really really broad brush and</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.389" end="01:29:10.630" style="s2">annoyingly broad brush sometimes so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.030" end="01:29:13.630" style="s2">kind of interesting but I&#39;ll go ahead pH</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.630" end="01:29:15.639" style="s2">a is the precursor in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.630" end="01:29:19.000" style="s2">endogenous steroid pathways and a block</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.639" end="01:29:21.309" style="s2">steroid pathways the precursor to most</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.000" end="01:29:24.130" style="s2">of the androgens testosterone and other</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.309" end="01:29:27.130" style="s2">androgens and so I don&#39;t know what their</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.130" end="01:29:28.900" style="s2">process in coming up with including the</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.130" end="01:29:31.300" style="s2">HEA was but if it was simply just saying</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.900" end="01:29:34.000" style="s2">this is part of the you know conversion</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.300" end="01:29:36.010" style="s2">pathway to testosterone you know you can</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.000" end="01:29:38.920" style="s2">see how they would come up with it but</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.010" end="01:29:41.739" style="s2">yeah I agree especially in terms of dose</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.920" end="01:29:44.349" style="s2">dependence we see various degrees of</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.739" end="01:29:47.559" style="s2">adrenal fatigue so commonly and there is</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.349" end="01:29:49.179" style="s2">this pregnenolone steal preferential</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.559" end="01:29:51.190" style="s2">shunting of the precursor to both</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.179" end="01:29:52.960" style="s2">cortisol and DHEA the hormone</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.190" end="01:29:55.630" style="s2">pregnenolone moving to cortisol whenever</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.960" end="01:29:56.530" style="s2">there is you know chronic ongoing stress</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.630" end="01:29:59.380" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.530" end="01:30:04.140" style="s2">almost everyone and so elevated cortisol</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.380" end="01:30:07.770" style="s2">to DHEA ratio is common enough and</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.140" end="01:30:10.270" style="s2">damaging enough that some DHEA was</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.770" end="01:30:12.940" style="s2">included in the stack for general HPA</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.270" end="01:30:14.380" style="s2">support yeah yeah interesting I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.940" end="01:30:15.850" style="s2">I&#39;m all in favor of it as a supplement</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.380" end="01:30:17.920" style="s2">but you know like like for me for</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.850" end="01:30:19.570" style="s2">example because I know I know now people</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.920" end="01:30:22.510" style="s2">are like jump with you the microphones</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.570" end="01:30:24.340" style="s2">asking you know how I can be competing</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.510" end="01:30:26.050" style="s2">and using something that has DHEA in it</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.340" end="01:30:29.560" style="s2">you know with good conscience the fact</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.050" end="01:30:31.270" style="s2">is I would never use anything that</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.560" end="01:30:33.160" style="s2">contains a bad substance leading up to a</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.270" end="01:30:35.530" style="s2">race and in many cases you&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.160" end="01:30:37.030" style="s2">things that are banned for in season</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.530" end="01:30:38.830" style="s2">competition are taking right before a</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.030" end="01:30:41.320" style="s2">race are not banned for things like like</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.830" end="01:30:45.970" style="s2">offseason use so there&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.320" end="01:30:49.030" style="s2">consideration as well now obviously 42</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.970" end="01:30:53.440" style="s2">different freakin ingredients in this</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.030" end="01:30:55.480" style="s2">stuff so it it&#39;s it kind of returns full</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.440" end="01:30:57.820" style="s2">circle to what we talked about in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.480" end="01:30:59.590" style="s2">very beginning Daniel how a big part of</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.820" end="01:31:01.180" style="s2">this is to rather than just putting</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.590" end="01:31:03.190" style="s2">caffeine in your body or rather just</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.180" end="01:31:04.690" style="s2">putting say like Mon daffodil in your</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.190" end="01:31:07.660" style="s2">body or rather just than just putting</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.690" end="01:31:09.550" style="s2">like you know coleus forskohlii or silt</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.660" end="01:31:11.650" style="s2">up or oxytocin or any of these other</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.550" end="01:31:14.350" style="s2">things in your body basically you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.650" end="01:31:16.960" style="s2">developing more of like a full systems</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.350" end="01:31:18.820" style="s2">approach but one one more kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.960" end="01:31:22.240" style="s2">big-picture question I have for you is</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.820" end="01:31:25.900" style="s2">it seems as though neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.240" end="01:31:28.030" style="s2">collective your website is kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.900" end="01:31:30.190" style="s2">poised to go above and beyond just</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.030" end="01:31:33.550" style="s2">creating some kind of like a like a</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.190" end="01:31:36.340" style="s2">super powerful nootropic and if you were</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.550" end="01:31:37.990" style="s2">to name say like the the biggest one or</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.340" end="01:31:39.730" style="s2">two things that you have coming down the</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.990" end="01:31:41.140" style="s2">pipeline that you think are going to</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.730" end="01:31:42.760" style="s2">kind of like flip the industry on its</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.140" end="01:31:44.110" style="s2">head when it comes to cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.760" end="01:31:45.280" style="s2">enhancement is there anything in</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.110" end="01:31:47.530" style="s2">particular that you guys are developing</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.280" end="01:31:49.000" style="s2">and your deep dark secret Batman</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.530" end="01:31:51.349" style="s2">laboratories that you want to let people</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.000" end="01:31:55.130" style="s2">know about</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.349" end="01:31:57.679" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re working both internally in</p>

<p begin="01:33:50.989" end="01:33:55.909" style="s2">like when you were asking about TBI</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.159" end="01:33:58.130" style="s2">earlier someone can have an event where</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.909" end="01:34:00.349" style="s2">there&#39;s some you know mild traumatic</p>

<p begin="01:34:10.910" end="01:34:14.030" style="s2">of symptoms that could occur so say</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.320" end="01:34:15.620" style="s2">anxiety is one of the possibilities</p>
