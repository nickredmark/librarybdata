<p begin="00:07:29.770" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">awareness because it&#39;s discarded for</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.300" end="00:07:36.039" style="s2">lack of relevance and anyway the point</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:37.539" style="s2">is that the world outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.039" end="00:07:40.090" style="s2">immediate sphere we rely on information</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.539" end="00:07:42.969" style="s2">imparted to us by other people in the</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.969" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">books newspapers films etc etc and so a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.659" end="00:07:56.159" style="s2">range of perspectives is necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:58.930" style="s2">example if you ask a police investigator</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.159" end="00:08:00.580" style="s2">at the scene of a crime they ask a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.930" end="00:08:02.199" style="s2">witnesses to describe what they&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.580" end="00:08:03.669" style="s2">they will get a dozen different witness</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.199" end="00:08:06.069" style="s2">accounts it doesn&#39;t mean anyone&#39;s lying</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.669" end="00:08:07.900" style="s2">or deceptive in any way it just means</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.069" end="00:08:10.870" style="s2">different people see things differently</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.900" end="00:08:12.940" style="s2">and so in order to construct any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.870" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">reliable view of the world you need a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.940" end="00:08:18.550" style="s2">variety of information and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:21.250" style="s2">this being the matrix my contention is</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.550" end="00:08:23.830" style="s2">that that does not happen so by deciding</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.250" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">what we are told and more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.830" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">what we are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:31.090" style="s2">told by distorting and manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:33.399" style="s2">information by narrowing ranges of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.090" end="00:08:36.490" style="s2">opinion and perspectives our thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.399" end="00:08:40.120" style="s2">our opinions our imaginations even our</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.490" end="00:08:44.430" style="s2">very worldview can be surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.120" end="00:08:47.649" style="s2">easily controlled and so a free open</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.430" end="00:08:51.579" style="s2">unrestricted unconsolidated flow of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.649" end="00:08:53.410" style="s2">information is therefore essential for</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.579" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">the smooth functioning of the society</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.410" end="00:08:57.070" style="s2">and so what I really want to look at is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:08:59.019" style="s2">two main things for the rest of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.070" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">video I want to look at how the media</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.019" end="00:09:02.740" style="s2">industry has consolidated over the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:04.420" style="s2">few decades and how the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.740" end="00:09:06.339" style="s2">information has been concentrated into</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.420" end="00:09:08.500" style="s2">ever fewer and fewer and fewer hands a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.339" end="00:09:09.730" style="s2">familiar story if you remember the story</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.500" end="00:09:10.899" style="s2">if you remember what&#39;s happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.730" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">banking industry over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.899" end="00:09:15.490" style="s2">decades in the second part of this in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:17.160" style="s2">another video which will come fairly</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.490" end="00:09:20.170" style="s2">shortly I&#39;m going to look at how</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.160" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">dissenting voices people who stubbornly</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.170" end="00:09:26.699" style="s2">refused to be silent have been silenced</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:26.699" style="s2">anyway</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.380" end="00:10:14.300" style="s2">so like I said back in the day the media</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.180" end="00:10:15.890" style="s2">in the US was subsidized and there were</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.300" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">thousands and thousands of radio</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.890" end="00:10:20.900" style="s2">stations and newspapers each town had</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:22.670" style="s2">its own radio station at least one its</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.900" end="00:10:25.520" style="s2">own newspaper at least one bigger towns</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.670" end="00:10:26.900" style="s2">had quite a few TV starts to change</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.520" end="00:10:28.279" style="s2">everything because they realized that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.900" end="00:10:30.050" style="s2">they could start making money out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.279" end="00:10:34.010" style="s2">advertising on a scale that they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.050" end="00:10:38.540" style="s2">unable to on radio or on newspapers and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.010" end="00:10:41.170" style="s2">so the larger company started lobbying</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.540" end="00:10:44.450" style="s2">Congress to allow consolidation and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.170" end="00:10:49.010" style="s2">1934 the Communications Act was signed</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.450" end="00:10:50.600" style="s2">and this gave away basically publicly</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.010" end="00:10:52.490" style="s2">owned airways to a few large</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.600" end="00:10:55.370" style="s2">corporations and this is the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.490" end="00:10:58.730" style="s2">of the networks in the u.s. this was NBC</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.370" end="00:11:01.010" style="s2">CBS and ABC becoming national networks</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.730" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">and this was simply given to him this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.010" end="00:11:04.610" style="s2">was publicly owned Airways publicly</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:06.920" style="s2">owned transmitters etc which was just</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.610" end="00:11:08.950" style="s2">given away to companies to now make</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.920" end="00:11:10.940" style="s2">profits from their advertising revenues</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.950" end="00:11:12.529" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s quite an extraordinary thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.940" end="00:11:13.730" style="s2">just given away creating a privately</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.529" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">owned monopoly has a publicly owned</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.730" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">infrastructure but at least it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:21.290" style="s2">regulated there were laws in place which</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:24.350" style="s2">prevented anyone network opening too</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.290" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">much in terms of local radio stations</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.350" end="00:11:29.029" style="s2">and TV stations and so on so that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:30.770" style="s2">no one company could define the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.029" end="00:11:32.600" style="s2">discourse and similarly there were</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.770" end="00:11:34.490" style="s2">barriers against any one company owning</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.600" end="00:11:37.880" style="s2">the TV and the radio and the newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.490" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">in any one town not to mention all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.880" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">of other restrictions based on their</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:42.110" style="s2">practices you know they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:44.300" style="s2">advertise much during children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.110" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">programming I had to get equal airtime</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.300" end="00:11:49.100" style="s2">to political candidates from different</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:50.330" style="s2">parties they when they leave their lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.100" end="00:11:51.800" style="s2">they had to show themselves to be fit</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.330" end="00:11:54.230" style="s2">proper responsible people to hold an</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.800" end="00:11:55.550" style="s2">heir license so you know there were many</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.230" end="00:11:57.830" style="s2">restrictions placed on their practices</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.550" end="00:11:59.300" style="s2">this all starts to change under Ronald</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.970" end="00:22:59.610" style="s2">going a good example of this is the</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.610" end="00:23:01.950" style="s2">you remember a couple of years later</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.690" end="00:23:02.520" style="s2">there were riots on the streets of</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.809" end="00:23:11.880" style="s2">but after the 2008 crash as of now not</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.429" end="00:23:20.580" style="s2">we are sending a message as a society</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.030" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">assumption that it&#39;s okay for them to</p>

<p begin="00:25:57.900" end="00:26:03.570" style="s2">question that that&#39;s okay secondly have</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.500" end="00:26:06.360" style="s2">a look at the audience&#39;s reaction to a</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.429" end="00:26:14.040" style="s2">mouthed they are look how they get</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.440" end="00:26:17.460" style="s2">cameras out to start filming it this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.040" end="00:26:20.520" style="s2">how unused we have become to people just</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.460" end="00:26:23.970" style="s2">talking plain and simple truth on the</p>
