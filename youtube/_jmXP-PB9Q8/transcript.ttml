<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.709" style="s2">I am a somatic psychotherapist and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.040" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">been studying psychology for 19 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.709" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">and four years ago and met you and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:27.230" style="s2">you took up my Monday nights for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">past four years and and a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.230" end="00:02:33.709" style="s2">weekends and I discovered circling to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:35.870" style="s2">I first started circling as a way to I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.709" end="00:02:39.049" style="s2">looked at it as a way to be more human</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.870" end="00:02:42.260" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t circling in a way to improve</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.049" end="00:02:45.319" style="s2">my capacity as a therapist but I found</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.260" end="00:02:47.709" style="s2">that that it did over time by learning</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.319" end="00:02:50.540" style="s2">how to relate more deeply and thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.709" end="00:02:52.280" style="s2">personally it just naturally started</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.540" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">influencing my work as a therapist and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.280" end="00:02:58.459" style="s2">I&#39;ll often tell my clients I&#39;ll let them</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:00.829" style="s2">know specifically what I&#39;m doing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.459" end="00:03:02.389" style="s2">terms of direct relating and telling</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.829" end="00:03:04.760" style="s2">them where I&#39;m drawing this from then</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.389" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s very powerful especially in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.760" end="00:03:09.379" style="s2">working with couples but also just in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:12.409" style="s2">working with individuals and relating</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.379" end="00:03:15.500" style="s2">with the space between us right you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.409" end="00:03:18.590" style="s2">what I mean I have lots of memories of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.500" end="00:03:22.940" style="s2">you having this inquiry about I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.590" end="00:03:25.669" style="s2">about being a therapist and then being</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.940" end="00:03:27.849" style="s2">involved in circling and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.669" end="00:03:30.590" style="s2">intensity and an intense inquiry about</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.849" end="00:03:33.650" style="s2">what is you know what is being a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.590" end="00:03:36.349" style="s2">therapist versus circling and how do</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.650" end="00:03:38.660" style="s2">they connect and how do they how does</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.349" end="00:03:40.519" style="s2">one enhance the other and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.660" end="00:03:42.079" style="s2">really really big inquiry for you for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.519" end="00:03:44.449" style="s2">while and it&#39;s remember having lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.079" end="00:03:47.290" style="s2">conversations with you about that and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.449" end="00:03:50.120" style="s2">would imagine knowing that you are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.290" end="00:03:51.949" style="s2">being who is in a constant state of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.120" end="00:03:52.849" style="s2">wonder and inquiry about the way the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.949" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">universe works</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.849" end="00:03:57.620" style="s2">I would imagine we&#39;d be very sad if</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:01.099" style="s2">there&#39;s any final conclusions on that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.620" end="00:04:04.099" style="s2">but I&#39;m also still I&#39;m still curious</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.099" end="00:04:06.500" style="s2">about like how that is and how a circle</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.099" end="00:04:10.940" style="s2">circling is affected you as a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.500" end="00:04:17.329" style="s2">and but also just you know before we go</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.940" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">into that I recall meeting you salt at</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.329" end="00:04:22.460" style="s2">an event at a mutual friend&#39;s house who</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:24.830" style="s2">did these kind of social little</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.460" end="00:04:26.780" style="s2">gatherings with with dinner but that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.830" end="00:04:27.110" style="s2">kind of structured that was designed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.780" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.110" end="00:04:32.689" style="s2">together like a deeper sense of relating</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:34.699" style="s2">and that&#39;s that he invited me to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.689" end="00:04:38.120" style="s2">and take it even deeper through bringing</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.699" end="00:04:39.409" style="s2">circle into the event and I remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.120" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">having it just a really cool connection</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.409" end="00:04:45.469" style="s2">with you and just remembering you being</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">impressed by what was happening really a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.469" end="00:04:50.539" style="s2">particular way and then then I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:55.069" style="s2">started seeing you once or twice a week</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.539" end="00:04:57.319" style="s2">for the rest of my life sense about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.069" end="00:04:59.030" style="s2">what was the thing that you saw if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.319" end="00:05:00.889" style="s2">can recall the thing that spoke to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.030" end="00:05:04.849" style="s2">about certain point that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.889" end="00:05:07.460" style="s2">good launch into just a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.849" end="00:05:09.500" style="s2">circling and what I do and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.460" end="00:05:11.719" style="s2">involvement with it and then we can jump</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.500" end="00:05:14.060" style="s2">to the other stuff mm-hmm yeah well that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.719" end="00:05:18.349" style="s2">was at Scott Herman&#39;s house and thank</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.060" end="00:05:20.740" style="s2">you Scott and I remember when you showed</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.349" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">up after I had been in a few of those</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.740" end="00:05:26.719" style="s2">conversations with him and the group of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:29.930" style="s2">people you you brought a depth a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.719" end="00:05:33.110" style="s2">quickness to the depth of inquiry and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.930" end="00:05:35.300" style="s2">remember being both in enjoying your</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.110" end="00:05:39.259" style="s2">presence I had an instant sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.300" end="00:05:40.819" style="s2">trusting your intention but I know I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.259" end="00:05:42.860" style="s2">listening for trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.819" end="00:05:44.810" style="s2">are you doing how do you how are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.860" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">going deep and because I know some we</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.810" end="00:05:48.199" style="s2">can go too deep too fast with some</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:51.529" style="s2">people and open things up too much and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.199" end="00:05:54.199" style="s2">and so I was actually listening for that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.529" end="00:05:56.719" style="s2">for quite a while and then but I just I</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.199" end="00:06:00.020" style="s2">gradually started to realize that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.719" end="00:06:02.779" style="s2">took about a year of just participating</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.020" end="00:06:06.969" style="s2">without directly knowing what circling</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.779" end="00:06:10.279" style="s2">was only through experience of of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.969" end="00:06:12.650" style="s2">trusting the inquiry and extrapolating</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.279" end="00:06:15.460" style="s2">out the parts and but that first meeting</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.650" end="00:06:19.129" style="s2">I remember being both impressed and very</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.460" end="00:06:20.900" style="s2">curious about what how you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.129" end="00:06:23.029" style="s2">what you were doing what what you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.900" end="00:06:28.009" style="s2">seeing and how you were coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.029" end="00:06:32.500" style="s2">your questions and I like the look that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.009" end="00:06:32.500" style="s2">you that you gave what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.000" end="00:06:43.169" style="s2">what was he doing yeah I did</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.680" end="00:06:47.220" style="s2">because you and I had worked together</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.169" end="00:06:50.850" style="s2">for personally cook Co counseling for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.220" end="00:06:55.080" style="s2">long time so I learned directly over and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.850" end="00:06:58.949" style="s2">over that you you have a way of getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.080" end="00:07:01.650" style="s2">my experience in a way nobody has to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.949" end="00:07:04.139" style="s2">that extent a lot of you know my really</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.650" end="00:07:05.669" style="s2">good friends can go in and out of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.139" end="00:07:07.530" style="s2">they don&#39;t always want me to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.669" end="00:07:09.990" style="s2">pain I feel so they might try to talk me</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:03.630" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I take from</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.310" end="00:08:28.259" style="s2">makes almost senses to in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.870" end="00:08:30.539" style="s2">attachment does it it like because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.259" end="00:08:32.279" style="s2">my understanding of attachment at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.539" end="00:08:37.469" style="s2">in when they talk about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.279" end="00:08:39.209" style="s2">couples is and I&#39;m I&#39;m actually in in a</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.209" end="00:08:43.229" style="s2">Brianne we&#39;ve been seeing an attachment</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.159" end="00:08:46.020" style="s2">therapist for a little bit under a year</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.229" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">and I&#39;ve really really really enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.020" end="00:08:50.910" style="s2">and learned so much I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:53.410" style="s2">learned a lot about actually what I do</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:08:54.819" style="s2">circling more</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.410" end="00:09:01.720" style="s2">oddly about the way that she works with</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.819" end="00:09:04.269" style="s2">us and like the thing that why that</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:06.639" style="s2">automatically brings me to the to what</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.269" end="00:09:10.079" style="s2">how that might lead to something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.639" end="00:09:13.449" style="s2">the experience of secure attachment is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.079" end="00:09:15.790" style="s2">secure attachment from a couples</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.449" end="00:09:18.220" style="s2">perspective from a romantic partnership</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.790" end="00:09:22.660" style="s2">perspective it is it&#39;s kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.220" end="00:09:24.129" style="s2">it&#39;s like how I was told is that when</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.660" end="00:09:27.689" style="s2">you&#39;re in a securely attached</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.129" end="00:09:31.870" style="s2">relationship right one is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.689" end="00:09:33.310" style="s2">attachment for adult relationships isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.870" end="00:09:36.129" style="s2">something that you&#39;re supposed to grow</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.310" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s something that through</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.129" end="00:09:42.100" style="s2">maturity you grow in your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">have it which is which is goes so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.100" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">through those against so much cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:49.689" style="s2">conditioning that I know that I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:52.839" style="s2">that is been actually surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.689" end="00:09:55.750" style="s2">relieving to realize that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.839" end="00:09:58.300" style="s2">fundamental human need they have one</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.750" end="00:10:01.959" style="s2">place in the universe in this case the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.300" end="00:10:06.040" style="s2">relationship where there is no ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.959" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">where I know that I am loved and cared</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.040" end="00:10:11.620" style="s2">for I&#39;m accepted even when I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:13.420" style="s2">shitty right that there is one person in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.620" end="00:10:16.449" style="s2">the universe with absolutely without</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.420" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">without a doubt will reassure me will</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.449" end="00:10:24.610" style="s2">get me will understand me will accept me</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:27.220" style="s2">and that when we have that that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.610" end="00:10:29.949" style="s2">changes our orientation in with</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.220" end="00:10:31.509" style="s2">everything else like me that I have that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.949" end="00:10:34.149" style="s2">secure attachments to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.509" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">open then go out and tolerate more and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.149" end="00:10:40.990" style="s2">more ambiguity in in the world because</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:42.689" style="s2">the world is ambiguity so if I have more</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.990" end="00:10:45.639" style="s2">tolerance of ambiguity that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.689" end="00:10:49.329" style="s2">deeply affect how I my relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.639" end="00:10:51.220" style="s2">risk you know and in the stress that all</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.329" end="00:10:54.699" style="s2">the things that are involved with being</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.220" end="00:10:56.709" style="s2">successful in the world if I know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.699" end="00:11:00.129" style="s2">that at the end of the day if when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.709" end="00:11:04.870" style="s2">come home I can come home and deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.129" end="00:11:07.209" style="s2">relax and not have to worry about being</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.870" end="00:11:10.389" style="s2">with another and being deeply secure</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.209" end="00:11:11.110" style="s2">attached in the in the most closin sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.389" end="00:11:14.410" style="s2">of the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.110" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">so with getting someone&#39;s world it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.410" end="00:11:20.740" style="s2">you&#39;re getting someone&#39;s world in order</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:22.540" style="s2">to change them at all that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.740" end="00:11:25.269" style="s2">getting someone&#39;s world right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.540" end="00:11:26.829" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s getting them to try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.269" end="00:11:29.379" style="s2">have a different world than they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.829" end="00:11:30.490" style="s2">having so it&#39;s like it fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.379" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">getting someone&#39;s world is not only</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.490" end="00:11:36.839" style="s2">understanding them but uh but but</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:40.569" style="s2">understanding them in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.839" end="00:11:46.059" style="s2">implicit of not only do I want to do I</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.569" end="00:11:48.339" style="s2">want to get you but I want to get what</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.059" end="00:11:50.439" style="s2">has you experience what your experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.339" end="00:11:53.079" style="s2">is what feels like to experience what</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.439" end="00:11:56.139" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing to see what is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.079" end="00:11:59.170" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing and why you would see it</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.139" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">that way not only just like not only</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.170" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">just understand you but just deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:06.040" style="s2">accept you so fully where you&#39;re at such</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:09.459" style="s2">that like perhaps maybe I even</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.040" end="00:12:12.999" style="s2">understand and and get you more than you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.459" end="00:12:15.009" style="s2">even know that there is to get so so in</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.999" end="00:12:16.740" style="s2">that kind of immediacy that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.009" end="00:12:19.299" style="s2">acceptance that kind of closeness</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.740" end="00:12:20.889" style="s2">it&#39;s where when I started to have that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.299" end="00:12:23.889" style="s2">my relationship with with this</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.889" end="00:12:26.799" style="s2">attachment therapist that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.889" end="00:12:30.490" style="s2">seeing I&#39;m like I&#39;m like wow this</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.799" end="00:12:34.029" style="s2">reminds me a lot of circling and I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.490" end="00:12:35.709" style="s2">add about this somatic aspect of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.029" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">you described in terms of feeling a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.709" end="00:12:42.879" style="s2">secure base and going out to the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:44.999" style="s2">so I see it as it&#39;s a process of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.879" end="00:12:48.309" style="s2">an externalized secure base and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.999" end="00:12:50.889" style="s2">we&#39;re always re internalized thing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.309" end="00:12:53.769" style="s2">growing our own sense of secure base</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.889" end="00:12:56.259" style="s2">that ideally happens in childhood but</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.769" end="00:12:59.619" style="s2">for at least 50% of the population it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.259" end="00:13:01.749" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and what I&#39;ve read and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.619" end="00:13:05.049" style="s2">experienced and the good news is that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.749" end="00:13:07.899" style="s2">can be it can be grown as adults even if</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.049" end="00:13:10.990" style="s2">you&#39;ve never experienced it before and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.899" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">think the process of feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.990" end="00:13:17.470" style="s2">connections to your partner and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.999" style="s2">leaving the house or turning towards of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.470" end="00:13:20.199" style="s2">the world I think all day long I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.999" end="00:13:20.590" style="s2">there would be moments when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.199" end="00:13:23.590" style="s2">turning</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.590" end="00:13:27.130" style="s2">back towards the secure base internally</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.590" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">and externally because we like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.130" end="00:13:30.940" style="s2">premise that we can only focus on one</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:32.950" style="s2">thing at a time even if you know our</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.940" end="00:13:34.930" style="s2">attention is diffuse there&#39;s still one</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.950" end="00:13:37.330" style="s2">point of reference even if it&#39;s back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.930" end="00:13:39.970" style="s2">forth really quickly and so just having</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.330" end="00:13:41.950" style="s2">that as you know we&#39;re looking out</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.970" end="00:13:44.670" style="s2">towards the world taking risks the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.950" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">challenges turning back feeling safe</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.670" end="00:13:51.400" style="s2">mirrors that process of the baby</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:55.000" style="s2">crawling away from the parent and back</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.400" end="00:13:58.150" style="s2">again and when when the child is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.000" end="00:14:01.690" style="s2">when the parent or primary caregiver is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.150" end="00:14:03.340" style="s2">not a secure place but an insecure one</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.690" end="00:14:06.010" style="s2">when that when a child turns back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.340" end="00:14:09.250" style="s2">sees the parent distracted or angry</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.010" end="00:14:11.770" style="s2">agitated if there&#39;s all this ambivalence</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.250" end="00:14:14.710" style="s2">I get set up you know there&#39;s a need for</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.770" end="00:14:19.180" style="s2">it but then also the fear of going</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.710" end="00:14:22.570" style="s2">towards it find oh so you&#39;re what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:24.430" style="s2">saying is like that the person it could</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.570" end="00:14:26.980" style="s2">be actually set up to where the person</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.430" end="00:14:29.530" style="s2">that I my nervous system is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.980" end="00:14:31.630" style="s2">move towards and to attach that it could</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.630" end="00:14:36.960" style="s2">person becomes I turn towards them and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.420" end="00:14:39.730" style="s2">feel threatened and I want to move away</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.960" end="00:14:42.520" style="s2">but you&#39;re caught because you need them</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.730" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">on it to survive as a as an infant and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.520" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">so you feel both and that I think gets</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">recreated where we know the person we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:54.610" style="s2">going to be attached to will have that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:57.460" style="s2">kind of challenge where we expect I</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.610" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">think on unconsciously right just</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.460" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">appreciating the conundrum of that one</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:06.490" style="s2">oh my god like so what I both need right</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:08.590" style="s2">I moved toward right but wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.490" end="00:15:13.150" style="s2">there are threats oh I need to move away</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.590" end="00:15:16.650" style="s2">but I need them I need you do that times</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.150" end="00:15:18.760" style="s2">rather with enough people enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.650" end="00:15:22.170" style="s2">generations you&#39;ll probably end up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.760" end="00:15:22.170" style="s2">something like Burning Man</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:31.980" style="s2">this is Colonel and like cheer and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.200" end="00:15:34.360" style="s2">he&#39;ll bond it Tyson</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.980" end="00:15:37.470" style="s2">well I&#39;ve never been so I wouldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.360" end="00:15:40.120" style="s2">but um but it sounds wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.470" end="00:15:43.270" style="s2">what you I wrote that is number nine I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.120" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">made up these nine bullet points I I</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.270" end="00:15:46.510" style="s2">went through all the writing I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:47.790" style="s2">last year or when I was gathered when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.510" end="00:15:49.960" style="s2">was just writing on what I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.790" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">experiencing and circling and learning</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.960" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">from you and and then I wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:57.070" style="s2">article that my brother helped me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:59.440" style="s2">edit he put it in the shape that it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.070" end="00:16:02.140" style="s2">so my original writing is 14 pages it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.440" end="00:16:03.880" style="s2">nothing like the article that people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.140" end="00:16:06.490" style="s2">enjoying and I&#39;m really grateful to him</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.880" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">for helping me to put it in that way but</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.490" end="00:16:14.250" style="s2">here I have more more clinical</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">explanation of aspects of circling and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.250" end="00:16:22.420" style="s2">so giving of worlds is is the number</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:25.960" style="s2">nine number one I say is the emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.420" end="00:16:27.340" style="s2">sovereignty and subjectivity and direct</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.960" end="00:16:31.090" style="s2">experience I have all that lumped into</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.340" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">one and so the way circling teaches us</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.090" end="00:16:36.750" style="s2">to keep returning to sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:39.490" style="s2">experience to keep drawing from direct</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.750" end="00:16:44.500" style="s2">knowledge of subjective experience all</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.490" end="00:16:48.510" style="s2">that goes together and sorry I write</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.500" end="00:16:52.930" style="s2">that and so this is number one a reading</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.510" end="00:16:54.490" style="s2">but uh you know subjective reality is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.930" end="00:16:56.980" style="s2">understood to mean each person&#39;s unique</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.490" end="00:16:59.980" style="s2">intelligence that we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.980" end="00:17:03.130" style="s2">about objective reality but subjective</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.980" end="00:17:06.010" style="s2">through the senses direct knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.130" end="00:17:08.500" style="s2">then once we learn to trust that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.010" end="00:17:10.150" style="s2">just a continual unfolding I don&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.500" end="00:17:12.070" style="s2">I&#39;m angry in this moment I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.150" end="00:17:14.100" style="s2">be angry forever but in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.070" end="00:17:16.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a wisdom in my anger and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.100" end="00:17:19.560" style="s2">trusting that there&#39;s it&#39;s okay to hang</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.420" end="00:17:22.630" style="s2">out there in relationship with you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.560" end="00:17:26.079" style="s2">that that I&#39;m making the correlation</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.630" end="00:17:31.000" style="s2">that the the sense of sovereignty is our</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:32.200" style="s2">Homebase just like the secure base and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.000" end="00:17:35.740" style="s2">so that that&#39;s something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.200" end="00:17:38.200" style="s2">experiencing when when we&#39;re circling we</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.740" end="00:17:40.930" style="s2">keep experiencing that over and over so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.200" end="00:17:42.460" style="s2">your thing is it&#39;s like that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.930" end="00:17:43.620" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is sovereignty I want</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.460" end="00:17:45.100" style="s2">to make sure I&#39;m getting a versa</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.620" end="00:17:47.169" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.100" end="00:17:49.860" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying the sovereignty is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.169" end="00:17:52.870" style="s2">essentially being grounded in and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.860" end="00:17:54.910" style="s2">knowing one that I have an interior or</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.870" end="00:17:57.789" style="s2">&#39;ti an internal experience and a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.910" end="00:17:59.980" style="s2">subjective experience that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.789" end="00:18:02.620" style="s2">that there&#39;s lots of experiences out</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.980" end="00:18:05.890" style="s2">there but I know which one&#39;s mind right</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.620" end="00:18:08.830" style="s2">now it&#39;s located am I getting it yep and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.890" end="00:18:11.860" style="s2">that and not only that I know that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.830" end="00:18:13.750" style="s2">have a subjectivity but what I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.860" end="00:18:15.640" style="s2">you say is is with sovereigns do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.750" end="00:18:19.750" style="s2">mean that that there&#39;s a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.640" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">trust or a sense of validity I have in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.750" end="00:18:26.260" style="s2">my in being sovereign about my</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:27.909" style="s2">subjectivity like so so like is it like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.260" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">I give myself permission to feel what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.909" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">feel experience what I experienced and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:37.720" style="s2">what I heard you say is that I trust</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:39.700" style="s2">that there&#39;s an innate intelligence to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.720" end="00:18:41.950" style="s2">that experience that even though even if</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.700" end="00:18:44.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily like it for</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.950" end="00:18:46.600" style="s2">example even if I&#39;m not exactly sure why</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.200" end="00:18:50.470" style="s2">I&#39;m angry or my anger doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.600" end="00:18:54.039" style="s2">necessarily make sense to my mind in</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.470" end="00:18:56.530" style="s2">sovereignty there&#39;s a trust in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.039" end="00:19:00.159" style="s2">it is and I&#39;m experiencing and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.530" end="00:19:01.929" style="s2">intrinsically bad exactly you know and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.159" end="00:19:03.909" style="s2">in Monday nights circling and the drop</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.929" end="00:19:05.140" style="s2">in circles we have I hear over and over</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.909" end="00:19:07.539" style="s2">and over and over especially when people</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.140" end="00:19:10.140" style="s2">are trying to understand the circling</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.539" end="00:19:12.460" style="s2">process and struggling in they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.140" end="00:19:14.500" style="s2">you know I want to I want to speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.460" end="00:19:17.980" style="s2">correctly or I want to I want to get it</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.500" end="00:19:20.470" style="s2">right or I&#39;m feeling disconnected I</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.980" end="00:19:24.159" style="s2">don&#39;t know why but we keep slowing it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.470" end="00:19:26.770" style="s2">down and just just being with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.159" end="00:19:30.760" style="s2">process I said I heard you say that last</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.770" end="00:19:32.110" style="s2">night to someone he said to you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.760" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">referenced what you heard and then he</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.110" end="00:19:35.049" style="s2">said any you don&#39;t know why and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:37.659" style="s2">there sounds like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.049" end="00:19:40.299" style="s2">important to that and just are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.659" end="00:19:43.330" style="s2">mirroring that stayed with an unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.299" end="00:19:47.140" style="s2">experience and why it&#39;s different than</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.330" end="00:19:49.140" style="s2">psychotherapy is a lot of psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.140" end="00:19:53.429" style="s2">is relational there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.140" end="00:19:56.530" style="s2">therapy so I&#39;m not knocking therapy like</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.429" end="00:19:58.020" style="s2">it Beck&#39;s you&#39;re one of them right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.530" end="00:20:01.320" style="s2">not knocking myself</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.020" end="00:20:04.260" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that in traditional therapy</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.320" end="00:20:05.790" style="s2">there&#39;s as far as I know not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.260" end="00:20:09.870" style="s2">emphasis on present moment experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.790" end="00:20:13.380" style="s2">which is number two and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.870" end="00:20:15.000" style="s2">there is generally the effort or to help</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.380" end="00:20:16.530" style="s2">somebody to feel to grow their</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.000" end="00:20:19.400" style="s2">self-esteem and trust their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.530" end="00:20:21.960" style="s2">experience but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.400" end="00:20:25.320" style="s2">gathered doesn&#39;t happen as directly as</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.960" end="00:20:27.540" style="s2">we do it encircling because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.320" end="00:20:29.100" style="s2">keep coming back directly we&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.540" end="00:20:32.130" style="s2">the past and if you spend a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.100" end="00:20:33.150" style="s2">time in the past that can happen there</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.130" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">too I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.150" end="00:20:39.450" style="s2">psychotherapy is for developing secure</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:41.250" style="s2">attachment but in a lot of ways it</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.450" end="00:20:44.330" style="s2">happens in a very different way because</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.250" end="00:20:49.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not an equal relationship and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.330" end="00:20:54.120" style="s2">it&#39;s more of parent child&#39;s recreation</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.170" end="00:20:57.720" style="s2">then then peer-to-peer recreation right</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.120" end="00:20:59.730" style="s2">let&#39;s secure attach attach feeling so so</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.720" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">we have sovereignty and present moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.730" end="00:21:07.650" style="s2">experience as being what we consistently</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:09.540" style="s2">return to to feel how connected how</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.650" end="00:21:12.420" style="s2">close or distant and you feel and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.540" end="00:21:15.210" style="s2">distance is not made wrong we just keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.420" end="00:21:16.500" style="s2">noticing that we feel distant but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.210" end="00:21:19.950" style="s2">still sitting here in the room in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.500" end="00:21:23.160" style="s2">circle and so in some we&#39;re still in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.950" end="00:21:25.950" style="s2">relationship like what I&#39;m liking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.160" end="00:21:28.050" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is is that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.950" end="00:21:32.520" style="s2">almost like I what I&#39;m almost getting is</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.050" end="00:21:38.309" style="s2">that there&#39;s an inherent trust maybe or</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.520" end="00:21:40.440" style="s2">faith in something that is as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.309" end="00:21:42.059" style="s2">can tell is probably one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.440" end="00:21:44.940" style="s2">things in the universe that are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.059" end="00:21:48.900" style="s2">actually in our arguable right which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.940" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">my experience right I&#39;m feeling I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.900" end="00:21:53.390" style="s2">thinking what I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:58.500" style="s2">experiencing what I&#39;m experiencing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.390" end="00:22:00.690" style="s2">if I describe it just as it is one is I</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.500" end="00:22:03.510" style="s2">have to I actually have to look to find</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.690" end="00:22:05.429" style="s2">it it&#39;s a perception right I like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.510" end="00:22:07.169" style="s2">way you do that I know I&#39;ve learned that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.429" end="00:22:09.179" style="s2">from other people and my teacher bill</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.169" end="00:22:10.830" style="s2">Boeing but but somehow when when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.179" end="00:22:12.030" style="s2">first taught me that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.830" end="00:22:14.610" style="s2">because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.030" end="00:22:17.580" style="s2">express their these I have to look you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.610" end="00:22:19.050" style="s2">know it really got to me yeah yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.580" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">have to thought as you don&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.050" end="00:22:23.130" style="s2">know what you&#39;re experiencing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">there&#39;s something about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.130" end="00:22:28.800" style="s2">something about that combination of one</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:31.170" style="s2">one is I&#39;m the only one that can share</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.800" end="00:22:34.020" style="s2">it share about it because I&#39;m it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.170" end="00:22:37.560" style="s2">subjective experience no one well no one</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.020" end="00:22:41.190" style="s2">no one else will ever occupy my subject</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.560" end="00:22:43.700" style="s2">right and so I am in fact the authority</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.190" end="00:22:47.340" style="s2">over my experience yet at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.700" end="00:22:50.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m making it up it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.340" end="00:22:53.160" style="s2">I look and I find out that my leg is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.670" end="00:22:55.170" style="s2">hurting and I find out that my belly</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.160" end="00:22:58.620" style="s2">feels full and they find out that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.170" end="00:23:00.900" style="s2">angry so in certain sense it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.620" end="00:23:02.790" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s really interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.900" end="00:23:05.850" style="s2">you when you look into the mystery of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.790" end="00:23:08.340" style="s2">this that my subjectivity on one hand is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.850" end="00:23:10.620" style="s2">the one thing that only I have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.340" end="00:23:13.560" style="s2">authority over yet I have to look to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.620" end="00:23:17.220" style="s2">find out what it is that&#39;s just trippy</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.560" end="00:23:20.070" style="s2">right so that so to have because I know</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.220" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">in circling we do emphasize agency right</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.070" end="00:23:25.950" style="s2">and sovereignty as it&#39;s kind of bedrock</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:28.770" style="s2">you could say like like that&#39;s that like</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.950" end="00:23:30.900" style="s2">that&#39;s home base in encircling it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.770" end="00:23:33.540" style="s2">place that we always return to it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.900" end="00:23:36.660" style="s2">place that we speak from we listen from</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.540" end="00:23:40.560" style="s2">and and we share from is continually</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.660" end="00:23:43.850" style="s2">owning our own personal experience and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.560" end="00:23:47.400" style="s2">describing it as our own right versus</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.850" end="00:23:49.830" style="s2">you know projecting it on you or blaming</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.400" end="00:23:55.170" style="s2">you for it or it is simply owning what</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.830" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like to be myself with you and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.170" end="00:24:02.190" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of that that&#39;s bedrock and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:05.130" style="s2">that ownership is based on acceptance we</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.190" end="00:24:09.000" style="s2">can&#39;t own what we don&#39;t accept and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.130" end="00:24:11.250" style="s2">that&#39;s number three is acceptance and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.000" end="00:24:13.920" style="s2">think that that I write that the power</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.250" end="00:24:16.020" style="s2">of acceptance is I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.920" end="00:24:17.970" style="s2">greatest healing powers there is and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.020" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">circling is promoting that over and over</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.970" end="00:24:22.380" style="s2">and over because even in the moment if</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:25.400" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling triggered by someone in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.380" end="00:24:27.830" style="s2">circle and having trouble with what</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.400" end="00:24:30.260" style="s2">opening that practice for me would be to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.830" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">can accept that I&#39;m not accepting what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.260" end="00:24:35.090" style="s2">happening so you go to some level of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:38.090" style="s2">practicing acceptance of present moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.090" end="00:24:42.560" style="s2">reality and circling just keeps doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.090" end="00:24:43.820" style="s2">that over and over again so it&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.560" end="00:24:46.180" style="s2">you try to make sure I&#39;m getting what</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.820" end="00:24:50.180" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.180" end="00:24:53.300" style="s2">so acceptance yeah that isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.180" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">interesting like that week it&#39;s strange</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.300" end="00:24:57.140" style="s2">we&#39;re such peculiar creatures right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:25:01.970" style="s2">like I can have this pain in my wrist</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.140" end="00:25:04.100" style="s2">right and I can in it&#39;s undeniable I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.970" end="00:25:06.380" style="s2">feeling it right now I&#39;m like you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.100" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like throbbing right there and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.380" end="00:25:10.580" style="s2">kind of has this like it close my eyes I</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:13.930" style="s2">kind of picture it as red and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.580" end="00:25:18.740" style="s2">of it&#39;s exactly the way that it is right</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.930" end="00:25:23.930" style="s2">but I can actually have it like that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.740" end="00:25:29.870" style="s2">then not accept it that weird like or I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.930" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">can accept it so it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.870" end="00:25:34.460" style="s2">acceptance and you think at that point</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:38.030" style="s2">to what acceptance is is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.460" end="00:25:40.730" style="s2">like acceptance isn&#39;t given given with</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.030" end="00:25:44.420" style="s2">experience yeah way I participate with</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.730" end="00:25:46.550" style="s2">my experience yeah I think possible it</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.420" end="00:25:48.530" style="s2">seems that wouldn&#39;t be possible if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.550" end="00:25:51.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t accept it yeah it&#39;s being in</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.530" end="00:25:55.450" style="s2">disagreement about with fighting with</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.110" end="00:25:59.240" style="s2">reality about about the way reality is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.450" end="00:26:01.300" style="s2">and then I translate that oh I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.240" end="00:26:04.760" style="s2">hear what you said there I said</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.300" end="00:26:10.730" style="s2">disagreeing with reality usually reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.760" end="00:26:14.630" style="s2">seems to win it&#39;s bigger and stronger</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.730" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">and faster and so but I I just I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.630" end="00:26:21.650" style="s2">musing on the way that these practices</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.740" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">might relate to feeling secure</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.650" end="00:26:25.430" style="s2">attachment or how they would affect</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:28.360" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s anxiously or avoiding lis</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.430" end="00:26:30.710" style="s2">attached and one thing I wrote is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.360" end="00:26:32.510" style="s2">hearing that hearing you say that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.710" end="00:26:36.740" style="s2">noticed I&#39;m feeling anxious and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.510" end="00:26:38.870" style="s2">thought you wouldn&#39;t mind holding me</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.740" end="00:26:43.400" style="s2">during the interview would you can we do</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.870" end="00:26:45.170" style="s2">but here you reach through and hold me</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.400" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">during the interview I was really</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.170" end="00:26:50.660" style="s2">anxious when you talked it like that oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:53.540" style="s2">yes okay I&#39;m holding one my heart beats</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.660" end="00:26:56.420" style="s2">to you sure but what I&#39;m what I notice</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.540" end="00:27:00.130" style="s2">is I think I&#39;m generalizing but for</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.420" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">somebody who is anxiously attached it um</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.130" end="00:27:04.220" style="s2">the end for someone who&#39;s avoidant lis</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">attached they&#39;re being met right where</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.220" end="00:27:08.360" style="s2">they are so I I think that for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:12.250" style="s2">anxious attachment there can be thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.360" end="00:27:14.420" style="s2">of are we connected what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.250" end="00:27:16.190" style="s2">basically around that are we still</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.420" end="00:27:18.650" style="s2">connected you still like me are we still</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.190" end="00:27:20.660" style="s2">in relationship and what I notice about</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.650" end="00:27:22.340" style="s2">circling is we&#39;re already answering</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.660" end="00:27:24.920" style="s2">those questions before we even have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.340" end="00:27:27.500" style="s2">ask so it&#39;s not the same as asking for</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.920" end="00:27:31.670" style="s2">reassurance we&#39;re doing it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.500" end="00:27:33.230" style="s2">that&#39;s spontaneous and we can ask we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.670" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">just say when I said that what happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.230" end="00:27:38.630" style="s2">for you and often people are already</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:41.540" style="s2">answering it before we even have to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.630" end="00:27:45.559" style="s2">anything and so it it changes the space</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.540" end="00:27:47.870" style="s2">between two or more people so that what</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.559" end="00:27:51.380" style="s2">usually doesn&#39;t even get addressed at</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.870" end="00:27:54.550" style="s2">all in at work or parties or even among</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.380" end="00:27:58.460" style="s2">close friends I have this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.550" end="00:28:00.890" style="s2">often with friends of mine how good</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.460" end="00:28:02.620" style="s2">friends of ours can&#39;t we can&#39;t relate we</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.890" end="00:28:04.940" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.620" end="00:28:07.130" style="s2">well actually I&#39;m jumping to the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.940" end="00:28:10.550" style="s2">one which is withholding where people</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.130" end="00:28:13.160" style="s2">withhold deep experiences between good</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.550" end="00:28:14.570" style="s2">friends and so and don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.160" end="00:28:15.429" style="s2">people are actually experiencing so</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.570" end="00:28:18.950" style="s2">let&#39;s go together</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.429" end="00:28:23.030" style="s2">um I mean they&#39;re just kind of all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.950" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">are part of being a way encircling but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.030" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">think they still can parse it out</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:28.670" style="s2">because we&#39;re continually withholding</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.290" style="s2">something there&#39;s something I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.670" end="00:28:31.640" style="s2">telling you right now about what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.290" end="00:28:33.950" style="s2">experiencing but it might not be</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.640" end="00:28:36.710" style="s2">relevant but right there&#39;s always some</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.950" end="00:28:38.150" style="s2">level of experience and circling is</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.710" end="00:28:40.160" style="s2">inviting it and I love that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.150" end="00:28:44.660" style="s2">there&#39;s not pressure I think there can</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.160" end="00:28:47.300" style="s2">be it can be more confident the way we</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.660" end="00:28:50.660" style="s2">practice on Monday nights tends to not</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.300" end="00:28:52.580" style="s2">generally be we&#39;re not pulling or</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.660" end="00:28:54.019" style="s2">digging you know it&#39;s just an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.580" end="00:28:57.559" style="s2">and when you&#39;re ready as you&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.019" end="00:29:00.250" style="s2">you can try it out and you know people</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.559" end="00:29:03.529" style="s2">take big risks with that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.250" end="00:29:06.890" style="s2">invitation yeah so they just want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.529" end="00:29:09.230" style="s2">make sure that we&#39;re tracking for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.890" end="00:29:16.309" style="s2">people watching and for me so number one</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.230" end="00:29:19.309" style="s2">was what so number one was number one is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.309" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">sovereignty sovereignty okay in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.309" end="00:29:28.510" style="s2">present moment an acceptance and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:33.350" style="s2">for is withholding so um sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.510" end="00:29:35.000" style="s2">present moment acceptance and what was</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.350" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">the other one withholding and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.000" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">withholding okay gotcha yeah so we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:43.730" style="s2">the practice of revealing with holes</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:46.580" style="s2">yeah the present moment acceptance and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.730" end="00:29:51.260" style="s2">practicing sharing with holds so like by</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.580" end="00:29:53.630" style="s2">withhold what I&#39;m hearing you say is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.260" end="00:29:55.669" style="s2">like you could say that like isn&#39;t with</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.630" end="00:29:57.799" style="s2">what I with hold are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.669" end="00:30:01.549" style="s2">cuz on some level it seems like anytime</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.799" end="00:30:04.850" style="s2">I share something subjectively right</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.549" end="00:30:06.769" style="s2">I could withhold that information right</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.850" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">so when I share something subjective</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.769" end="00:30:14.450" style="s2">that I don&#39;t have to that I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:16.519" style="s2">not I&#39;m not withholding I&#39;m sharing a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.450" end="00:30:18.169" style="s2">withhold is that is that what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.519" end="00:30:21.139" style="s2">in the most basic level or do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.169" end="00:30:21.980" style="s2">something more specifically like sharing</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.139" end="00:30:23.510" style="s2">something that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.980" end="00:30:26.299" style="s2">yeah sharing something that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.510" end="00:30:29.750" style="s2">because I think it in general in our</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.299" end="00:30:32.659" style="s2">culture we don&#39;t tend to reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.750" end="00:30:35.539" style="s2">deeper fears and that&#39;s what perpetuates</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.659" end="00:30:38.990" style="s2">I think it perpetuates anxious and avoid</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.539" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">an attachment people will feel in</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.990" end="00:30:41.389" style="s2">relationship with people I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:43.639" style="s2">what you&#39;re thinking I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.389" end="00:30:45.710" style="s2">you think of what I just did or said and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.639" end="00:30:48.200" style="s2">and I&#39;ve literally attached well just</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.710" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">avoid I don&#39;t care I don&#39;t care what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.200" end="00:30:52.970" style="s2">think I&#39;m just gonna stay away from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:55.100" style="s2">intimacy and yeah that&#39;s saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.970" end="00:30:56.929" style="s2">afraid I&#39;m afraid of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.100" end="00:30:58.309" style="s2">thinking I mean we wouldn&#39;t say like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.929" end="00:31:01.460" style="s2">know maybe not quite like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.309" end="00:31:02.870" style="s2">nuance tactful ways to share experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.460" end="00:31:05.780" style="s2">but that&#39;s what takes practice and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.870" end="00:31:07.880" style="s2">practicing that and circling so</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.780" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">so I just really got it when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.880" end="00:31:13.370" style="s2">about like from the anxious attachment</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:16.400" style="s2">perspective which is my understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.370" end="00:31:17.930" style="s2">like so my understanding of what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.400" end="00:31:19.610" style="s2">attachment theory is you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.930" end="00:31:23.630" style="s2">there&#39;s like you know if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.610" end="00:31:27.280" style="s2">graph right and on this this side is</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.630" end="00:31:31.700" style="s2">avoidant and this side is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.280" end="00:31:35.240" style="s2">anxious if the middle like if the middle</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.700" end="00:31:37.940" style="s2">between the two points is secure the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.240" end="00:31:42.350" style="s2">people&#39;s people can fall more on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.940" end="00:31:45.650" style="s2">anxious side of attachment to avoidant</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.350" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">side of attachment it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.650" end="00:31:49.850" style="s2">people usually like like to have fun</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:52.670" style="s2">bike like usually like hooking up with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.850" end="00:31:55.670" style="s2">deer if you&#39;re in a habit tendency</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.670" end="00:31:57.260" style="s2">towards avoidant attachment those people</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.670" end="00:31:58.760" style="s2">usually like to have a lot of fun by</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.260" end="00:32:05.030" style="s2">getting involved with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.760" end="00:32:09.130" style="s2">anxiously attached that like so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.030" end="00:32:09.130" style="s2">mating they can go on for years right</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.700" end="00:32:16.550" style="s2">you saying is that is that through</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.510" end="00:32:20.170" style="s2">sharing with holes right through sharing</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.550" end="00:32:21.830" style="s2">my especially if for example I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.170" end="00:32:24.580" style="s2">speaking for the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.830" end="00:32:27.950" style="s2">listening to this like if for example</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.580" end="00:32:29.390" style="s2">I&#39;m somebody who is anxiously attached</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.950" end="00:32:31.370" style="s2">and I&#39;m in a relationship with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.390" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">who&#39;s an avoidant attached somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.370" end="00:32:37.040" style="s2">who&#39;s attachment of weight and part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:40.100" style="s2">being a anxious attached the more</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.040" end="00:32:42.290" style="s2">anxious I am the more apt I am to try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.100" end="00:32:45.470" style="s2">reach you like I think that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.290" end="00:32:48.020" style="s2">what I&#39;ve heard people talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.470" end="00:32:49.130" style="s2">like what I&#39;ve read in the therapy that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.020" end="00:32:51.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve done stuff like that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.130" end="00:32:53.390" style="s2">basically what I hear is people with</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.620" end="00:32:55.040" style="s2">anxious attachment this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.390" end="00:32:57.050" style="s2">basically what they&#39;re almost always</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.040" end="00:32:57.560" style="s2">saying when they&#39;re anxious are you</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.050" end="00:32:59.240" style="s2">there</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.610" end="00:33:23.179" style="s2">system right it is this is what I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.260" end="00:33:26.570" style="s2">appreciate it and like I just so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.179" end="00:33:28.790" style="s2">appreciated this about being in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.570" end="00:33:31.429" style="s2">and working on this stuff it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.790" end="00:33:34.250" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit more well I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.429" end="00:33:36.440" style="s2">on the disorganized spectrum which is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.250" end="00:33:40.570" style="s2">whole other thing there&#39;s other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.440" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s my favorite flavor if anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.570" end="00:33:46.820" style="s2">more towards of the avoidant so but what</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:49.400" style="s2">I didn&#39;t realize is that when my partner</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.820" end="00:33:51.140" style="s2">would get would get anxious I had no</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.400" end="00:33:54.260" style="s2">idea she was anxious because she would</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.140" end="00:33:55.970" style="s2">be in a rage I thought she was mad and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.260" end="00:34:00.230" style="s2">coming after me so therefore I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.970" end="00:34:01.910" style="s2">whoa like like I don&#39;t know of course</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.230" end="00:34:04.250" style="s2">which which which is fueled by</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.910" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">justification for withdrawing but</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.250" end="00:34:09.560" style="s2">actually when I found out underneath all</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:12.440" style="s2">of that realizing what was going on for</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.560" end="00:34:14.960" style="s2">her she was actually I&#39;m mentally</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.440" end="00:34:17.570" style="s2">terrified and like to her nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.960" end="00:34:20.179" style="s2">not to a rational mind right to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.570" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">rational mind she could you know make</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.179" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">sense of all that but the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:28.609" style="s2">actually counts to us how we feel she</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:31.960" style="s2">felt as if her life was on the line</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.609" end="00:34:34.280" style="s2">so she was her age were actually on</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.960" end="00:34:36.109" style="s2">calls for help</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.280" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">she&#39;s basically saying I&#39;m dying and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.109" end="00:34:42.649" style="s2">need you and I&#39;ll never forget like when</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:44.990" style="s2">I really really got that like I it</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.649" end="00:34:49.010" style="s2">really it really transformed the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.990" end="00:34:51.530" style="s2">that I related you her her calls to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.010" end="00:34:53.869" style="s2">connect if you will right and she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.530" end="00:34:56.359" style="s2">the more so the my understanding is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.869" end="00:35:00.770" style="s2">the more that we can actually read the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.359" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">signals not necessarily the typography</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.770" end="00:35:11.980" style="s2">or the surface of what&#39;s being said</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:11.980" style="s2">right if somebody really disrespects</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.600" end="00:35:20.090" style="s2">unda mental and much more vulnerable in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.580" end="00:35:21.800" style="s2">primordial really and I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.090" end="00:35:24.380" style="s2">when I could start to tune into that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.800" end="00:35:27.830" style="s2">level it wasn&#39;t like I had to have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.380" end="00:35:30.470" style="s2">bunch of thoughts about giving her what</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.830" end="00:35:33.080" style="s2">she needed it was like there was in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.470" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">listen ervis system responds like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.080" end="00:35:40.550" style="s2">oh you&#39;re hurting Oh like it wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:42.890" style="s2">I had to come up with a strategy yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.550" end="00:35:44.990" style="s2">you can really be permeable and feel it</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.890" end="00:35:47.000" style="s2">that was my experience right and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.990" end="00:35:49.150" style="s2">really right like it doesn&#39;t we can if</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.000" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">we didn&#39;t get that stuff from your kid</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.150" end="00:35:54.050" style="s2">yeah and get it when were adults and it</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:57.109" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take that long I&#39;m interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.050" end="00:35:58.820" style="s2">like you just need a few experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.109" end="00:36:00.920" style="s2">you stir your nervous system starts to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.820" end="00:36:03.470" style="s2">notice a difference like start to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.920" end="00:36:05.990" style="s2">anticipate something else right basic</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.470" end="00:36:07.910" style="s2">ways to express what&#39;s happening you</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.990" end="00:36:11.810" style="s2">know different options and as you were</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.910" end="00:36:15.830" style="s2">describing that I I just again come back</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.810" end="00:36:18.740" style="s2">to circling the way that the emphasis is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.830" end="00:36:20.900" style="s2">on the way we listen and so just having</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.740" end="00:36:23.900" style="s2">what I&#39;m proposing in general is just</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.900" end="00:36:26.119" style="s2">the basic and agreements that we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.900" end="00:36:28.250" style="s2">for the way we listen which is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.119" end="00:36:29.900" style="s2">practice unto itself and the way we</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.250" end="00:36:33.590" style="s2">express and communicate as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.900" end="00:36:36.500" style="s2">practice unto itself but the process of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.590" end="00:36:38.780" style="s2">listening for the deeper communication</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.500" end="00:36:41.660" style="s2">that I think is another thing a crime</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.780" end="00:36:43.250" style="s2">Allari aspect of the ways we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.660" end="00:36:45.470" style="s2">constantly missing each other is we</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.250" end="00:36:48.890" style="s2">focus too much on the words even when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.470" end="00:36:50.150" style="s2">intend to use right speech and express</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.890" end="00:36:52.609" style="s2">as well as we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.150" end="00:36:54.410" style="s2">it&#39;s still very simple or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.609" end="00:36:57.530" style="s2">happening side and we don&#39;t practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.410" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">really trying to hear what is the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.530" end="00:37:02.510" style="s2">experience and that&#39;s what I just heard</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:04.339" style="s2">you describing what you&#39;ve been doing is</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.510" end="00:37:05.990" style="s2">learning to hear the deeper message and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.339" end="00:37:07.670" style="s2">then circling we&#39;re just doing that over</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.990" end="00:37:10.099" style="s2">and over and over again and listening</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.670" end="00:37:11.480" style="s2">for the deeper message and I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.099" end="00:37:13.070" style="s2">that it&#39;s like what I really just got</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.480" end="00:37:14.510" style="s2">this is great thanks Ricky you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.070" end="00:37:18.290" style="s2">helping me kind of understand my</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.510" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">relationship we did not tell me about</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.290" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">that part I thought we were just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:27.020" style="s2">talk about sort of learn something about</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:29.290" style="s2">myself here tricky but the but I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.020" end="00:37:34.130" style="s2">learning things I just got really was</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.290" end="00:37:36.589" style="s2">yeah it was it was me for one sharing</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.130" end="00:37:38.720" style="s2">more from the deeper place and also when</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.589" end="00:37:39.850" style="s2">she couldn&#39;t for me to listen more</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.720" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.850" end="00:37:44.980" style="s2">what that actually like that as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:46.900" style="s2">thinking about it I can&#39;t I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.980" end="00:37:49.570" style="s2">I could I don&#39;t think I can fake that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.900" end="00:37:54.910" style="s2">actually have to sink deeper into myself</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.570" end="00:37:56.860" style="s2">and listen from a deeper place for that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.910" end="00:38:00.730" style="s2">for me to be able to perceive what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.860" end="00:38:02.680" style="s2">deeper in her which this is where which</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.730" end="00:38:06.310" style="s2">brings us back to where I think circling</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.680" end="00:38:09.700" style="s2">is could be a real you could say</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.310" end="00:38:11.320" style="s2">practicing around around that because</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.700" end="00:38:14.830" style="s2">you could say that like a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.320" end="00:38:16.120" style="s2">circling is in my understanding is you</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.830" end="00:38:18.490" style="s2">know we talk about what you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.120" end="00:38:21.820" style="s2">the precepts is is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.490" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">communicate is is to share from share</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.820" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">from our own experience you know agentic</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:30.070" style="s2">ly with sovereignty like owning our own</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:34.990" style="s2">experience sharing it and disclosing it</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.070" end="00:38:36.850" style="s2">with the intent to relate and that but</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.990" end="00:38:39.370" style="s2">here&#39;s the other part like the mastery</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.850" end="00:38:41.860" style="s2">part right like like extra credit points</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.370" end="00:38:45.100" style="s2">like uber like Jedi kind of mind trick</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.860" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">type of stuff I think actually the real</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.100" end="00:38:50.440" style="s2">the real training and circling is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:52.690" style="s2">just sharing your own experience or</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.440" end="00:38:55.810" style="s2">sharing and owning your own experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.690" end="00:38:59.050" style="s2">but listening to what the other says as</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.810" end="00:39:01.690" style="s2">them sharing their experience even if</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.050" end="00:39:03.670" style="s2">they&#39;re telling me what to do or proving</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.690" end="00:39:06.490" style="s2">a point or saying something on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.670" end="00:39:08.470" style="s2">surface that&#39;s yet really really intense</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.490" end="00:39:11.710" style="s2">and opinionated and then one level I</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.470" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">could easily take offense to but I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.710" end="00:39:17.560" style="s2">maybe like a master like more mastery or</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:20.590" style="s2">a more in-depth way of listening would</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.560" end="00:39:22.600" style="s2">be able to actually perceive you always</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.590" end="00:39:25.450" style="s2">on some level disclosing error</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.600" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">experience no matter how you share it</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.450" end="00:39:31.360" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s actually given</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:33.130" style="s2">is given that so much of what my</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.360" end="00:39:36.610" style="s2">understanding of secure attachment is</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.130" end="00:39:41.140" style="s2">about is about a nervous system very</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.610" end="00:39:44.920" style="s2">close in pre reflective level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.140" end="00:39:46.690" style="s2">experience yeah so if I can to in my you</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.920" end="00:39:49.480" style="s2">could say my sensorial my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.690" end="00:39:52.099" style="s2">perceive my Brazil &#39;ti to listen my</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.480" end="00:39:55.400" style="s2">ability to feel to sense into somebody</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.099" end="00:39:59.299" style="s2">the more clothes in I can feel myself</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.400" end="00:40:02.630" style="s2">and thus feel close into your own</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.299" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">nervous system the more I can respond to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.630" end="00:40:06.769" style="s2">not only what you say but all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:08.869" style="s2">different levels of what you say at</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.769" end="00:40:10.369" style="s2">least in a way such that I can check it</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.869" end="00:40:16.190" style="s2">out with you and find out if it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.369" end="00:40:18.859" style="s2">true for you so so number five and six</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.190" end="00:40:21.349" style="s2">you had already been referring to number</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.859" end="00:40:24.949" style="s2">five is Sharon impact and number six is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.349" end="00:40:28.789" style="s2">assuming positive intent and you were in</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.949" end="00:40:30.729" style="s2">the way you were describing yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.789" end="00:40:34.940" style="s2">know listening for the deeper messages</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.729" end="00:40:37.069" style="s2">to listen to I think to listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.940" end="00:40:38.150" style="s2">depth looks as well one really means to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.069" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">be saying only and is really</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.150" end="00:40:42.440" style="s2">experiencing has everything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:45.949" style="s2">assuming positive intent that that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.440" end="00:40:48.799" style="s2">in even when they sound it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.949" end="00:40:52.549" style="s2">to understand their expression you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.799" end="00:40:54.559" style="s2">be connect more directly to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.549" end="00:40:57.739" style="s2">imagining and assuming and in their</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.559" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">heart and the core of who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.739" end="00:41:02.690" style="s2">to me that is the developing of a secure</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:05.180" style="s2">base inside that trust and showing each</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.690" end="00:41:08.719" style="s2">other that deep respect and then the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.180" end="00:41:11.329" style="s2">other one about sharing impact is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.719" end="00:41:13.400" style="s2">are you already saying about referencing</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.329" end="00:41:17.390" style="s2">experience as that&#39;s happening so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.400" end="00:41:19.519" style="s2">just keep sharing it takes away the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.390" end="00:41:21.019" style="s2">mystery and it opens up a deeper mystery</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.519" end="00:41:22.819" style="s2">because most of what we think other</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.019" end="00:41:25.279" style="s2">people are experiencing with us is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.819" end="00:41:27.829" style="s2">what&#39;s happening it really shifts a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.279" end="00:41:30.229" style="s2">reality so fundamentally to make this a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.829" end="00:41:31.849" style="s2">regular part of communication as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.229" end="00:41:33.920" style="s2">matter of fact I would say like one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.849" end="00:41:36.410" style="s2">the one of the things I hear what people</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.920" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">get right off the bat a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.410" end="00:41:44.559" style="s2">are shocked at how little they knew what</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:48.589" style="s2">other people were actually experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.559" end="00:41:51.589" style="s2">and how and conversely how little they</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.589" end="00:41:54.769" style="s2">knew how much they were assuming about</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.589" end="00:41:56.089" style="s2">other people&#39;s experience and itself is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.769" end="00:41:58.509" style="s2">just that other people have an</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.089" end="00:42:01.150" style="s2">experience that&#39;s beyond what I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.509" end="00:42:03.799" style="s2">what I had already anticipate or think</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.150" end="00:42:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of remarkable like because</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.799" end="00:42:08.030" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things I always</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.360" end="00:42:10.010" style="s2">like to emphasize encircling is that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.030" end="00:42:13.310" style="s2">know you I&#39;m really really being with</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.010" end="00:42:17.330" style="s2">you right you will always outlive my</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.310" end="00:42:19.010" style="s2">conception of you mmm-hmm and and if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.330" end="00:42:22.220" style="s2">really being me I will always have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.010" end="00:42:23.600" style="s2">concept of you for you to outlive and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.220" end="00:42:25.070" style="s2">that&#39;s why we talk about like how I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.600" end="00:42:28.700" style="s2">always like to really emphasize that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.070" end="00:42:30.500" style="s2">circling is an I thou practice right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.700" end="00:42:33.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a term from Martin Buber</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.500" end="00:42:35.030" style="s2">and basically what he what he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.080" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">about and I it&#39;s really the only I thou</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.030" end="00:42:41.150" style="s2">practice that I know that that I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:45.050" style="s2">is it is explicitly a a practice with</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.150" end="00:42:46.940" style="s2">that a which when I when I relate when</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.050" end="00:42:49.430" style="s2">as he would say is like to be a human</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.940" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">being is to always be in a relation</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.430" end="00:42:53.840" style="s2">right I&#39;m in a relationship with my</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:56.900" style="s2">environment with other people the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.840" end="00:43:00.650" style="s2">society my body is a relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.900" end="00:43:04.960" style="s2">organs to itself creating holes and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.650" end="00:43:08.090" style="s2">given given the particular you could say</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:11.270" style="s2">resolution that human beings live acts</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.090" end="00:43:15.230" style="s2">right and we are able to perceive each</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.270" end="00:43:18.470" style="s2">other and in our world that we&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.230" end="00:43:21.980" style="s2">in a relationship with or constitute the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.470" end="00:43:23.660" style="s2">world as an it or thou what bluebird</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.980" end="00:43:27.290" style="s2">would say is that when I relate to you</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.660" end="00:43:31.880" style="s2">or something as in it I&#39;m relating to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.290" end="00:43:34.610" style="s2">you or it as a means to my own end</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.880" end="00:43:37.550" style="s2">right so the point in other words like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.610" end="00:43:39.830" style="s2">I&#39;m late to that cook as a means to my</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.550" end="00:43:42.200" style="s2">own end up drinking right I relate to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.830" end="00:43:46.370" style="s2">the car is my that might means my own</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.200" end="00:43:47.870" style="s2">and of driving now you can also relate</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.370" end="00:43:49.970" style="s2">to other human beings and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.870" end="00:43:52.100" style="s2">this is most we call relating is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.970" end="00:43:55.700" style="s2">relating to other human beings as its</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.100" end="00:43:59.450" style="s2">you know you are you&#39;re a means to my</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.700" end="00:44:01.610" style="s2">own end of being approved of right or</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.450" end="00:44:05.900" style="s2">your your means to my own ends</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.610" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">of being liked right or your means of my</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.150" end="00:45:47.700" style="s2">universality it&#39;s like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.320" end="00:45:50.070" style="s2">universe being being experienced in one</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:54.030" style="s2">singular event in that encounter and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.070" end="00:45:57.960" style="s2">that&#39;s where I found that the real the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.030" end="00:46:01.050" style="s2">real beauty of circling comes through</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.960" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s those experiences that I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.050" end="00:46:08.910" style="s2">say have deepened me more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:10.530" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever experienced and I would I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.910" end="00:46:11.670" style="s2">this is just you know I mean even though</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.530" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a year</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.670" end="00:46:16.080" style="s2">and a half I hadn&#39;t I&#39;d put it on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.670" style="s2">shelf until this article came out and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.080" end="00:46:19.620" style="s2">it&#39;s gotten a great response and now</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.670" end="00:46:22.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about it again that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.620" end="00:46:25.110" style="s2">I&#39;m just imagining that what you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.200" end="00:46:27.990" style="s2">described again is the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.110" end="00:46:30.030" style="s2">what happens when is the results or when</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.990" end="00:46:31.179" style="s2">you feel securely attached to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.030" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">and another</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.179" end="00:46:39.859" style="s2">you have that that depth of experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:42.199" style="s2">where you&#39;re more I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.859" end="00:46:45.140" style="s2">more comfortable with the unknown more</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.199" end="00:46:48.499" style="s2">able to tolerate conflict and ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.140" end="00:46:51.679" style="s2">and as you always talk about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.499" end="00:46:53.779" style="s2">the measure of satisfaction and intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.679" end="00:46:55.880" style="s2">is comfort with anxiety because as you</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.779" end="00:46:58.519" style="s2">say we&#39;re always going to be anxious</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.880" end="00:47:00.259" style="s2">with the unknown and so we really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.519" end="00:47:03.559" style="s2">something you directed my attention to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.259" end="00:47:06.109" style="s2">is switching switching my focus to pay</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.559" end="00:47:08.689" style="s2">attention to how do I relate to my own</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.109" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">anxiety in relationship it&#39;s in a way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.689" end="00:47:13.759" style="s2">me it&#39;s in the way of intimacy with</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:15.979" style="s2">others and directly them how I</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.759" end="00:47:19.400" style="s2">understand that is the paradox of to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.979" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">human is to simultaneously want to like</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.400" end="00:47:25.429" style="s2">have a deep drive to realize my own kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:28.130" style="s2">of cosmic specialness as a single as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.429" end="00:47:32.900" style="s2">single individual and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.130" end="00:47:35.809" style="s2">want to merge with everything those</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.900" end="00:47:38.929" style="s2">things come together needs are met in</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.809" end="00:47:42.140" style="s2">one single racin ship if we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.929" end="00:47:44.959" style="s2">close it means on some level both those</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.140" end="00:47:47.329" style="s2">things are what I want and so for me to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.959" end="00:47:49.219" style="s2">be me for me to be closer to you and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.329" end="00:47:52.579" style="s2">become in a certain sense one with you</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.219" end="00:47:55.189" style="s2">is analogous with me risking being</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.579" end="00:47:58.069" style="s2">different than you right and taking that</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.189" end="00:48:02.749" style="s2">risk which always includes anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.069" end="00:48:05.569" style="s2">excitation courage and my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.749" end="00:48:08.269" style="s2">of like how we how we move away from</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.569" end="00:48:10.519" style="s2">anxiety which is circling you could say</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.269" end="00:48:13.519" style="s2">is the practice of not moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.519" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">that anxiety that intensity and actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.519" end="00:48:19.160" style="s2">moving towards it and growing versus</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:20.479" style="s2">like submitting or destroying or</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.160" end="00:48:22.369" style="s2">dominating the situation all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.479" end="00:48:25.579" style="s2">different things that we do to move away</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.369" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">from that moment yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.579" end="00:48:33.229" style="s2">one thing another so we have those those</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:36.619" style="s2">six and the seventh or seven and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.229" end="00:48:41.569" style="s2">the last two are the group experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.619" end="00:48:43.880" style="s2">and community and I surround most people</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.569" end="00:48:46.489" style="s2">have commented when they&#39;ve read what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.880" end="00:48:48.199" style="s2">wrote in that first article about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.489" end="00:48:51.140" style="s2">imagining I think what I&#39;m hearing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.199" end="00:48:52.699" style="s2">they&#39;re taking this theory that circling</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.140" end="00:48:55.489" style="s2">promotes the experience of secure</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.699" end="00:48:57.769" style="s2">attachment and they&#39;re overlaying the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.489" end="00:48:59.329" style="s2">process of psychotherapy on the circling</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.769" end="00:49:01.130" style="s2">and when some people have suggested well</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.329" end="00:49:04.189" style="s2">what happens if everyone in the circle</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.130" end="00:49:05.689" style="s2">is if no one is securely attached what</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.189" end="00:49:07.729" style="s2">happens if the facilitator isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.689" end="00:49:09.799" style="s2">securely attached and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.729" end="00:49:12.439" style="s2">suggesting is that doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.799" end="00:49:16.099" style="s2">not as long as we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.439" end="00:49:18.589" style="s2">agreements and our intention is to keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.099" end="00:49:20.479" style="s2">listening keep owning experience all</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.589" end="00:49:22.759" style="s2">everything else we&#39;ve talked about and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.479" end="00:49:24.679" style="s2">there&#39;s at least one person in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.759" end="00:49:27.799" style="s2">circle who can facilitate and slow</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.679" end="00:49:31.640" style="s2">things down we tend to we almost always</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.799" end="00:49:33.679" style="s2">I mean rarely have we not recovered from</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">having a certain kind of intensely occur</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.679" end="00:49:39.469" style="s2">and what I&#39;m noticing is so different</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:42.259" style="s2">from circling and psychotherapy is</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.469" end="00:49:44.959" style="s2">circling is not group therapy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.259" end="00:49:49.339" style="s2">very therapeutic when you have five or</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.959" end="00:49:53.269" style="s2">six people mirroring you to you instead</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.339" end="00:49:55.400" style="s2">of just one person you can choose which</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.269" end="00:49:57.349" style="s2">one feels right or maybe they all do and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.400" end="00:50:00.650" style="s2">often people reflect very different</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.349" end="00:50:02.359" style="s2">things that all fit in some way but to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.650" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">me there&#39;s it creates this holding</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.359" end="00:50:06.559" style="s2">environment the way Winnicott would</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:10.039" style="s2">describe the holding environment of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.559" end="00:50:13.099" style="s2">mother and child and and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.039" end="00:50:15.769" style="s2">that that is fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.099" end="00:50:19.539" style="s2">than group therapy where it could become</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.769" end="00:50:22.099" style="s2">more there can be more confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.539" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">there&#39;s that&#39;s a very important practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.099" end="00:50:26.269" style="s2">fundamentally but this is just something</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:29.569" style="s2">very different about the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.269" end="00:50:31.009" style="s2">relating yellen&#39;s you think I just</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.569" end="00:50:33.769" style="s2">simply say that the one thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.009" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">said about like you know what happens if</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.769" end="00:50:39.559" style="s2">everyone including the facilitator is</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:41.630" style="s2">securely attached like oh my god why am</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.559" end="00:50:44.059" style="s2">i leading the blind well it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.630" end="00:50:46.099" style="s2">like you say that is kind of like saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.059" end="00:50:49.929" style="s2">what happens if we all get together and</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.099" end="00:50:49.929" style="s2">meditate and one of us has a thought</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.949" end="00:50:57.770" style="s2">well I think what it does is partially</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.630" end="00:51:00.280" style="s2">anyways it points to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.770" end="00:51:02.540" style="s2">like that that the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.280" end="00:51:05.030" style="s2">presuppositions that are both implicit</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.540" end="00:51:06.590" style="s2">and explicit encircling is a structure</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.030" end="00:51:08.540" style="s2">with holes just like you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.590" end="00:51:10.550" style="s2">about it creates the holding environment</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.540" end="00:51:13.220" style="s2">if you vote for it for something like</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.550" end="00:51:14.840" style="s2">circling to happen and so that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.220" end="00:51:17.600" style="s2">really cool about and why it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.840" end="00:51:20.330" style="s2">practice right it&#39;s like it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.600" end="00:51:22.820" style="s2">you could say rules the game right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.330" end="00:51:24.530" style="s2">and just like any we&#39;re like you know if</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.820" end="00:51:25.580" style="s2">you change the rules of Monopoly you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.530" end="00:51:27.320" style="s2">have a different game</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.580" end="00:51:29.540" style="s2">you know circling has some underlying</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.320" end="00:51:33.650" style="s2">rules like owning your own experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.540" end="00:51:36.560" style="s2">you know and so those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.650" end="00:51:38.950" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s that we don&#39;t have to be not</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.560" end="00:51:38.950" style="s2">nuts</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.730" end="00:51:44.900" style="s2">access circles are where we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.500" end="00:51:47.330" style="s2">like we always recover where those</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.900" end="00:51:50.630" style="s2">experiences where people do actually are</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.330" end="00:51:53.900" style="s2">forthcoming and share dissonance maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.630" end="00:51:57.020" style="s2">maybe like really well and responsibly</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.900" end="00:51:58.970" style="s2">sometimes not so responsibility but with</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.020" end="00:52:00.950" style="s2">the commitment to just continually</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.970" end="00:52:03.230" style="s2">coming together getting shared reality</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.950" end="00:52:05.930" style="s2">owning our experience getting each</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.230" end="00:52:08.180" style="s2">others worlds being with what so which</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.930" end="00:52:11.990" style="s2">is really what the practice is is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.180" end="00:52:14.270" style="s2">practice is I like to say sitting in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.990" end="00:52:17.540" style="s2">question how profoundly can we be with</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.270" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">what is right and so if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.540" end="00:52:24.820" style="s2">just that like imagine imagine imagine</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:27.890" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re with somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.820" end="00:52:29.840" style="s2">you&#39;re just taking a walk right and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.890" end="00:52:34.310" style="s2">start talking to them and really where</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.840" end="00:52:36.980" style="s2">they&#39;re coming from is is is is is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.310" end="00:52:39.620" style="s2">relating to you from the question how</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.980" end="00:52:42.530" style="s2">profoundly can I be with what is with</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.620" end="00:52:45.290" style="s2">you right now imagine that like how that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.530" end="00:52:47.240" style="s2">walk would be right like um what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.290" end="00:52:49.910" style="s2">conversations could come up what would</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.240" end="00:52:51.830" style="s2">that feel like what kinds of things you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.910" end="00:52:55.430" style="s2">may talk about what kinds of silences</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.830" end="00:52:58.460" style="s2">you may have but I think that if we if</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.430" end="00:53:01.160" style="s2">we all started to live in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.460" end="00:53:03.050" style="s2">that was more of the come from in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.160" end="00:53:06.500" style="s2">relations and the way that we were</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.050" end="00:53:11.600" style="s2">relating rather than communicating in</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.500" end="00:53:14.840" style="s2">order to get what I want instead right</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.600" end="00:53:17.090" style="s2">Lading in order in rather his paying</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.840" end="00:53:18.560" style="s2">exquisite attention right and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.090" end="00:53:20.360" style="s2">sharing what so with your</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.560" end="00:53:24.620" style="s2">moment-by-moment with the intention to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.360" end="00:53:28.130" style="s2">relate and to be with what is I have a a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.620" end="00:53:31.070" style="s2">go feeling relationships really really</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.130" end="00:53:33.380" style="s2">different and may even be very very</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.070" end="00:53:35.210" style="s2">nourishing much more nourishing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.380" end="00:53:37.790" style="s2">process of actually getting to that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.210" end="00:53:39.740" style="s2">point is complex just if you just put</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.790" end="00:53:42.680" style="s2">out a list of that as a rule book and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.740" end="00:53:44.870" style="s2">people studied on their own some people</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.680" end="00:53:46.490" style="s2">can do it but many can&#39;t and it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.870" end="00:53:49.250" style="s2">something I even after studying</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.490" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">psychotherapy for two and half decades I</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.250" end="00:53:54.650" style="s2">still had to practice the sharing of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:56.750" style="s2">impact the revealing of experience on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.650" end="00:53:59.270" style="s2">you know personal level could is very</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.750" end="00:54:01.550" style="s2">challenging and so so just because</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.270" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">people might know and hear the word you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.550" end="00:54:08.630" style="s2">just said you just can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:11.690" style="s2">substitute the framework for actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.630" end="00:54:13.190" style="s2">doing and it just requires experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.690" end="00:54:16.340" style="s2">over and over and what I&#39;m imagining is</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.190" end="00:54:18.860" style="s2">that circling would be like homeopathy a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.340" end="00:54:21.110" style="s2">homeopathic experience for the secure</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.860" end="00:54:24.050" style="s2">attachment where because people</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.110" end="00:54:26.660" style="s2">experience more warmth and connection</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.050" end="00:54:28.250" style="s2">after we see it every Monday night after</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.660" end="00:54:29.570" style="s2">three hours people are from how they</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.250" end="00:54:32.060" style="s2">felt the beginning to the end of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.570" end="00:54:37.400" style="s2">evenings it&#39;s just consistently</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.060" end="00:54:39.110" style="s2">remarkably different and but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.400" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">imagining we could just do that over and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.110" end="00:54:42.440" style="s2">over and over and over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:43.610" style="s2">that and something starts to collect in</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.440" end="00:54:48.890" style="s2">remember system so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.610" end="00:54:52.460" style="s2">suggesting people try yeah I totally</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.890" end="00:54:56.090" style="s2">agree and if anything if anything the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.460" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">experience of circling I would say if</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.090" end="00:55:01.610" style="s2">anything it can begin to set a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:04.580" style="s2">precedence for what&#39;s possible and like</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.610" end="00:55:05.630" style="s2">you know if you think about it is I</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.580" end="00:55:07.400" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.630" end="00:55:08.840" style="s2">lately you know me and my kind of trippy</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.400" end="00:55:11.810" style="s2">thoughts that I have but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.840" end="00:55:14.870" style="s2">thinking about like but when me before</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.810" end="00:55:18.110" style="s2">went before Columbus you know about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.870" end="00:55:21.620" style="s2">the world was round you know what were</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.110" end="00:55:23.780" style="s2">people walking around talking how not</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.620" end="00:55:26.180" style="s2">round the earth was</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.780" end="00:55:28.520" style="s2">right like were they like having a</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.180" end="00:55:32.210" style="s2">relationship with like like how unwound</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.520" end="00:55:34.100" style="s2">it was they even called it round or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.210" end="00:55:36.980" style="s2">round it just was I don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.100" end="00:55:40.490" style="s2">they thought of it is flat but I bet</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.980" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">that once word got out that that it went</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.490" end="00:55:45.830" style="s2">all the way around I have a feeling once</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:48.920" style="s2">people realize that it was possible to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.830" end="00:55:52.550" style="s2">go west and end up back to where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.920" end="00:55:55.640" style="s2">were that that was possible would set a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.550" end="00:55:57.490" style="s2">precedence for what what made every so</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.640" end="00:56:01.670" style="s2">many other things possible and how</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.490" end="00:56:04.250" style="s2">across the ocean how the horizon looked</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.670" end="00:56:06.380" style="s2">and what meant to you so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.250" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">like these these deep experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.380" end="00:56:12.800" style="s2">people have it circling if anything if</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.750" style="s2">anything what it does is I think it sets</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.800" end="00:56:16.040" style="s2">of precedents for what&#39;s possible and if</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.750" end="00:56:19.310" style="s2">you set a precedent for what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.040" end="00:56:22.430" style="s2">it changes that like that&#39;s it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.310" end="00:56:25.580" style="s2">a change in their horizon right which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.430" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">what gives meaning right so it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.580" end="00:56:30.230" style="s2">just can&#39;t emphasize that enough that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:32.390" style="s2">even like even if you just go once right</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.230" end="00:56:34.850" style="s2">and you have that experience you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.390" end="00:56:36.500" style="s2">those kinds of experiences do do have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.850" end="00:56:37.220" style="s2">big impact and I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.500" end="00:56:40.520" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.220" end="00:56:42.920" style="s2">yeah I remember that you said that use</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.520" end="00:56:44.990" style="s2">that term the first time we were working</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.920" end="00:56:47.120" style="s2">together and you use that over and over</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.990" end="00:56:49.610" style="s2">and how much my horizon would change and</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.120" end="00:56:52.310" style="s2">you are the one that gave me that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.610" end="00:56:53.990" style="s2">visual and I like the way you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.310" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">referring to that because it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.990" end="00:56:59.150" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very profound well I will</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:03.500" style="s2">always refer to it until I finally catch</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.150" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">it I mean I&#39;ve been for years and I just</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.500" end="00:57:11.330" style="s2">well it won&#39;t it won&#39;t let me well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:12.290" style="s2">really fun to talk with you and let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.330" end="00:57:15.950" style="s2">it again sometime</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.290" end="00:57:20.080" style="s2">much love it&#39;s so great thank you for</p>
