<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.929" style="s2">that&#39;s when things start to line up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.159" end="00:00:06.480" style="s2">and the more you&#39;re in that space the</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">more they line up and so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:12.389" style="s2">if you&#39;re like really in that space</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:14.250" style="s2">how much do things line up I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">experiences where everything came</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.250" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">together you know and and and there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:24.650" style="s2">very very powerful experiences and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.490" end="00:00:27.420" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re also characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.650" end="00:00:29.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like everything turns into a</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.420" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">musical symphony where each part is</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.750" end="00:00:35.430" style="s2">exactly appropriate for that moment and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:37.469" style="s2">and I think music actually expresses</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.430" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">that which is partly why music produces</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.469" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">transcendent experiences you know I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:44.700" style="s2">think it is an intimation of Paradise</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that and you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.700" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">think about that psychologically you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:52.250" style="s2">know because it also makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">psychologically that your optimal</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.250" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">experiences are going to occur when</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">you&#39;re most United with yourself and but</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what see we don&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2">understand the relationship between our</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">consciousness and the world we&#39;re at our</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">best when we&#39;re integrated completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">and there is an effect of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">integration in principle on what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">would normally regard as external</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">reality because external reality can</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">line up with that integration as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">and so-called external reality you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">I also think that figures like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:31.140" style="s2">Buddha you know he&#39;s an exemplar of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">possibilities of that alignment and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">exercise is the yogic exercises for</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:36.659" style="s2">example our attempts to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:39.030" style="s2">alignment into being you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.659" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">it&#39;s very centred on the body which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">quite interesting even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">spiritual tradition right it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">centered on the body and I think people</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">probably experience that when they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">peak sexual experiences with someone you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">know where there&#39;s real intimacy because</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">they&#39;re in the same place at the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">time and everything comes together for</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">that moment you know maybe literally yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">yes literally right and and and I also</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:10.379" style="s2">don&#39;t think that that linguistic usage</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">is chance right because I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.379" end="00:02:17.459" style="s2">place where that experience is</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:21.079" style="s2">a brief intimation of of heaven that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.459" end="00:02:21.079" style="s2">might be a way of thinking about it</p>
