<p begin="00:00:00.480" end="00:00:07.600" style="s2">this is a very strange setup</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.679" end="00:00:10.559" style="s2">i the last time i was here was before</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.600" end="00:00:12.400" style="s2">kovid and so you know the chairs were</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.559" end="00:00:14.960" style="s2">much more packed</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.400" end="00:00:16.720" style="s2">and people weren&#39;t wearing masks while</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.960" end="00:00:19.760" style="s2">they were looking at me</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.720" end="00:00:21.199" style="s2">this is kind of a strange image like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:26.080" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.199" end="00:00:26.080" style="s2">people sitting in this far apart way huh</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">hello welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.840" end="00:00:40.239" style="s2">welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s lovely to be here with you all um</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.719" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">brings up a lot of memories to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:52.399" style="s2">sitting in this room when i first joined</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:55.840" style="s2">the monastic academy</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.399" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">we we lived in this building i slept</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.840" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">probably would have been like right over</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">there on a bed roll</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">and we would do all of our retreats in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:04.879" style="s2">this room so i probably sat like</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">close to a dozen retreats i remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.879" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">one retreat in particular sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.479" style="s2">that corner and just watching the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">daylight come and go</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.479" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">and come and go through those windows</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">exactly there</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:17.920" style="s2">must have been about this time of year</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.920" end="00:01:25.360" style="s2">really sweet to be here with you all um</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:29.200" style="s2">so today i&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.360" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">pleasure and its relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.200" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">what we typically call concentration</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">what&#39;s often known in the business as</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">samadhi practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">and unfortunately i didn&#39;t print out my</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">notes so i&#39;m going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">this ipad but i promise you i&#39;m not like</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">playing angry birds or anything i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">actually looking at notes um</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">so the reason why i felt inspired to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:02:00.640" style="s2">pleasure and meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">twofold one</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.640" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">i get the sense from a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">meditation practice for them is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">in fact is often experienced as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">of slog or</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">a painful experience full of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">physical emotional psychological</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">distress which</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">beautiful like it&#39;s good to experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">and encounter the pain in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s very worthwhile um</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">and yet we can develop this capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">nourish ourselves to create kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">cultivate a sense of pleasure in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">practice so that&#39;s one reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">and the other was that this is what i i</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">recently sat at 75 day retreat</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">at the monastic academy and this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">mostly what i did was</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">i sat in the way that i&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">sharing with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">that&#39;s specifically um to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">cultivate pleasure hi buddies welcome</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">hello</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">hello welcome thanks for coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">so um so</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">before i get into the kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">technique and the way of approaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">pleasure and meditation that i want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">talk about i first want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">talk a little bit about like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">common frames for meditation</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">often we talk about concentration</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">and that is typically</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">thought to be a translation of the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">samadhi</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">so you if you&#39;ve hung out in buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">circles or meditation circles really</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">very much at all you will have heard the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">word samadhi if you haven&#39;t heard that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">word then then</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">kind of just let this go over your head</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really make a difference it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">mostly for folks who have</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">played in these circles a lot just to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">kind of trouble</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">some of the definitions that you might</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">have grown accustomed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">and so samadhi the act the etymology of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">means to collect or to bring together</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">translated as concentration i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">because for us in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">concentration has a very particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">of flavor</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">for me like it brings to mind being in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">high school or middle school and having</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">the teacher like</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">tell me to concentrate which usually</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">meant like get really focused</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">on this thing usually a thing i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">actually want to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">right it felt like oh i have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t really want to but i have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">like force my mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">to pay attention in a very narrow way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">something like it&#39;s like a book or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">math problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">and so i want to suggest a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">relating to this word samadhi that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">more to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">with cultivating a state of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">harmony to relate to it more</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">as generating a state of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">well-being and ease in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">the body and the mind the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">bringing together</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">the body the mind the energy of the body</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">into a state of harmonious ease</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">well-being nourishment</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">feeling of safety um that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">and so my sense based on my research and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">you know what i&#39;ve explored in my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">practice is that in fact this is what</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">the buddha was talking about when he</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">concentration practice or samadhi</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">practice and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">uh he said in fact in in in the senuta</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">nikaya</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:10.160" style="s2">the kind of like one of the holy texts</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">of buddhism you might say</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.160" end="00:06:13.600" style="s2">that concentration or samadhi practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">pleasure as its prerequisite and now</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">the buddha was you know didn&#39;t mess</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">around when it comes to causality he</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">wasn&#39;t being like</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">like arbitrary about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">between pleasure and concentration there</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">very clearly that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">actually get into states of samadhi</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">without pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the proximate cause you might say</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">of concentration</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not hard to even have like</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">almost like a psychological or an</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">evolutionary frame on this right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">we enjoy paying attention to things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">are pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">right i like it you know right</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s like you like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:01.759" style="s2">give your attention to things that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:03.520" style="s2">pleasurable and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.759" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">if you can give your attention to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s pleasurable your</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">attention will tend to stay there</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">and and in fact this is what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">like deep states of concentration is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">that there&#39;s a kind of feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">between the pleasure you get from paying</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">to end the like kind of um the settling</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">in on that pleasure and it just starts</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">feed back into itself and you get more</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.160" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">and more sort of steeped</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">more and more you let go into that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">well-being into that pleasure until it</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">becomes your whole world essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">you know i mean it&#39;s very it can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">extremely pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">and so um in fact there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">another uh suta where the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">the so i this is a little bit of this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">to kind of deconstruct people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">views that meditation like maybe you may</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">not have this view but the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">ought to be painful</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">that perhaps i&#39;m not really meditating</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">unless i&#39;m encountering</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">emotional physical psychological pain</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">you may not have that view</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">that&#39;s great you may have that view in</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">which case</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.959" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">strong word that&#39;s pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">harmonization practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">and i&#39;m getting a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">framing from a teacher named rob berbea</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:31.120" style="s2">was one of my primary teachers he passed</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">away recently</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:34.160" style="s2">but i&#39;ve found a couple of quotes of his</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.160" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">speak i think quite beautifully to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">way of approaching the practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">okay so he says</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">um samadhi that collectedness</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">that calm that concentration it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">it leads to happiness it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">lead to pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">a sense of well-being a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">happiness this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">what we are aiming towards and more and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">more over time</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">a really deep sense of pleasure and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">happiness and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">really deep profound more profound</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.440" end="00:10:19.279" style="s2">i would easily wager than anything one</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">has known before</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.279" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">again strong words he goes on says</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of harmonization if i can</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">use that word of the energies of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">body and mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">they come into alignment there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">kind of sense of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">some kind of sense of well-being that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">pervades the whole body space</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be very dramatic but</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">the experience of the body in states of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">samadhi is not so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">an experience of bones and fingers and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">nerves and what we all know very well</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">about the anatomy and the physiology of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">instead it&#39;s an experience of if i can</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">use this word of the energy body</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">this feels this space here that i call</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">my body</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">begins to feel like a field of energy</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">it&#39;s that i don&#39;t mean to make such a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">big deal out of this concept that comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">into a kind of wholeness and alignment</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">and harmonization</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">and some degree of well-being and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">i would invite you to close your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">and tune in to your body</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">and use your intention to relax</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">and see if you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">sense your body as a field of energy</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">see if that&#39;s available</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">almost like a field of tone or</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">texture vibration</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">you might if you find it hard to feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">shift your attention to your hands often</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">you can feel energy there more easily</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">again one of the ways that we obstruct</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">perceiving this is through muscular</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">so anytime you can relax that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">this sense of the body more available</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:29.200" style="s2">so do people were people able you open</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">your eyes now if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">not too far into samadhi uh you get a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">sense of it like just</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not like not like some esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">that&#39;s being talked about right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">this a different way of sensing this</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">thing we call a body</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing that comes into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">state of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">harmony and alignment in the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">samadhi</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">anybody have any questions so far is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">this pretty clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">i can&#39;t quite tell from being clear yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">so all this to say you are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">feel pleasure in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s okay if practice feels good</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">even really good even really really good</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">it&#39;s totally okay and in fact um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.279" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">advisable according to the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s totally trainable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">absolutely available to everybody here</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">to be able to if you want sit down</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">and pretty reliably experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">states of profound pleasure really is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">available to everyone here</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">just as the capacity to encounter deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">pain with equanimity and poise</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">is also available to everybody here</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">practice is a very broad territory</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">and here i&#39;m talking about one specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">that i&#39;ve found very valuable that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">to denigrate encountering pain</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">and being with pain being with suffering</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful but</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">so is cultivating a sense of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.680" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">and nourishment in the body</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">so another another quote um</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">and it says uh this is again rob barbaia</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">he says</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">yes i&#39;m concentrating on it yes i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">focusing on it</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">but i want to relish it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">maximize my enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">moment after moment where is the</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">and just wanting to lick every last bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.440" style="s2">of honey out of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a part i builded don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">underestimate how much we prevent</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">ourselves from enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">at all kinds of levels and through all</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">kinds of indoctrination</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.519" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">psychologically socially culturally</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">somatically concentrate sure</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">again and again and again samadhi is</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">about having a really good time</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">samadhi is about having a really good</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">yes that&#39;s right and so this is what i</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">did for 75 days</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">on my solo retreat and it was amazing</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">it was amazing because one i got to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">discover all the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s true i prevented my way myself</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">from feeling enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">i was like no i&#39;m actually not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">to feel good for no reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">like that&#39;s somehow like morally wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t deserve to feel good for no</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">reason i haven&#39;t worked hard enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not good enough yet i did a bad</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">thing a while ago and like you know i</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">actually deserve to feel more pain</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">first maybe if i feel a lot more pain</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">then i&#39;ll be able to enjoy and feel</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:16:00.639" style="s2">pleasure for no reason but not</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:00.639" style="s2">not yet not yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">and also i later experienced or</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">alongside that experience incredible</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">pleasure incredible joy incredible peace</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">incredible ease</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">for no reason at all which</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">talk about something that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">radical like how much</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">money do we spend every day</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">every week every year trying to feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">pleasure trying to feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">good imagine if you could have it for</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">free</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">anytime you wanted you can</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to practice that today</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">meditate today</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">the first i i feel like called to sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">uh disassemble some of the objections</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">some people who meditate a lot typically</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">have about just</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">feeling pleasure it was amazing i taught</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">this at i taught this at</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">maple and there were there was at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">one and i think two people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">got really angry when i taught this</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">because they were like</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">no no i can&#39;t just feel pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">that and in fact what they discovered</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">was that they had</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">deep rooted feeling beliefs that said</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">cannot if you&#39;re not allowed to feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">and they had to work through that first</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">before they could simply feel pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">you may find that today and that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">because that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">is what you might need to work through</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">to just feel good for no reason another</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">thing that i observed and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">reasons i loved this practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">is that the more completely that i was</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.160" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">able to give myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">to these states of well-being and ease</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">and pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">the more that my heart felt</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">safe to open so one teacher that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">worked with</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">says that these deep states of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">concentration</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">or samadhi are the opposite of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">right so if you think of trauma as kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">of like a chronic contraction</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">and holding in the body and like a kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">of negative</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">emotional mental psychological state</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">these states are</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">you know if you do it enough a chronic</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">a chronic kind of welcoming of um</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">wholesome beautiful states of mind and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">energies into the body</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">and over time like my heart would just</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">feel safe enough to open and to soften</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">you know pain would come up emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">pain would come up but it would be held</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">in this heart of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">fulfillment of deep nourishment that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">and felt totally capable of holding that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">pain whereas</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">when it felt like that there was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">of scarcity mentality</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">it didn&#39;t feel like it could right so it</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">in fact these states this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">enables us to more fully encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">pain of life</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">with a kind of poise and balance and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">open-heartedness</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">that we might not otherwise be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">okay so um</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll read this one again because i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">this is the part that needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">double clicking again and again which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">uh this is again robert baia</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">uh maybe most people</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">maybe most of us need to completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">forget the whole question of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">do i have it now am i in or out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">samadhi is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">it and focus rather on enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">on just really maximizing your enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">and getting the most enjoyment in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">and developing what needs to develop to</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">and just drop the whole question is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:51.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">no he&#39;s not saying that&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.520" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">case but maybe today in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">little workshop we can play with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">way of framing it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">okay great</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">so i&#39;ll say a little piece oh we have</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">different than uh typical sunday sits</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a little bit more like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">kind of clinic vibe workshop vibe</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">in that i&#39;m gonna lead a guided</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">for like maybe like seven to ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">to get in touch with this</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">what i refer to as the energy body</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna and i&#39;m gonna then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">gonna stop and we&#39;re gonna have a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">q a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">just to make sure that&#39;s like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">kind of gets that because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">basis then for the next</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">guidance that i&#39;m going to lead and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">will form another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">primary piece in this approach to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">practice which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">how to relate to that energy body</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">in a way that brings those energies into</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">harmony</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.039" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">into alignment through breath and using</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">the attention</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">and using um actually conception</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">uh then we&#39;ll do a little short q a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">about that just to see like everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:05.039" style="s2">that and then finally we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">do a last guided practice where we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.039" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">we&#39;ll use those two pieces to try to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">if we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">amplify pleasure specifically</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">so how&#39;s that sound everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">good cool okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.840" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">to begin with find a posture of the body</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">expresses a sense of simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">openness and receptivity</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">along with alertness steadiness</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">i try making micro adjustments</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">moving your spine</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">you can kind of sense there&#39;s a tone</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">in the somatic field of uprightness</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">kind of verticality</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">then once you&#39;ve found that or to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">whatever degree you found that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">you might just invite your body to relax</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">wherever you notice any obvious muscle</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">tension just</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">let that release into the ground</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">you might bring your attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.840" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">area remind yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.840" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">that no other reason to do this practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">than as an act of kindness</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">kindness to yourself kindness to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.000" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">see if you can let that sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">of wholesomeness of goodness</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">touch your body</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">this is a beautiful act you&#39;ve been open</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">then stretching your awareness to cover</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">the whole field of the body</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">and a little bit beyond the body just an</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">inch or two</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">almost if it works for you the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">an egg shape</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.279" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">and permeate that whole field with</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.840" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">might experience it as a field of tone</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.840" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">texture vibration</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">energy some traditions they call it chi</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">prana often called impermanence and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">just tune in</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">tuning the radio station the radio dial</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">to this field</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">this field of this energy body</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">not trying to change it or interfere</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.600" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">with it in any way</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">opening opening</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">invariably your attention will contract</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">will get contracted and when you notice</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">simply stretch it back open</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">to cover this whole field</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">if you notice obvious muscular tension</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">just relax</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">again tension</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">in the body obstructs the flow of energy</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">the more you can relax your body the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">more vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">this field becomes</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">so for all the practices we&#39;ll do today</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">this forms the base</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">this energy body experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">so take a few more moments to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">tune in to become sensitive to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">way of being with the body it&#39;s way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">sensing the body</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">and just release into it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.840" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">with this practice it&#39;s not at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">important to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">anatomical clarity</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">it is important to try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">stretch your attention your awareness to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">cover the whole space</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be clear that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">have fingers or toes or</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">legs just a field of energy</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">permeate that field with your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">a few moments i&#39;ll ring the bell</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">when i do see</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">to what degree you can stay in touch</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">with this energy body as we</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">move into a little bit of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s possible to always keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">a little bit of attention there</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s fun to explore</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">so this is a chance to maybe clarify if</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">that was confusing to you or if you had</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">accessing the energy body</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:33.919" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t or if there are no</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">questions we can move on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.919" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">guidance</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:41.440" style="s2">but if there&#39;s anything anybody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:41.440" style="s2">share about that or</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">accessing that like i feel like in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">morning i just like still i feel this</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">sense of pleasure because i can hold my</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">heart it feels like it&#39;s radiating out</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">of my heart</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">and i you know i&#39;m like laying down for</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">like 15 minutes i just feel that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">but now doing it it&#39;s like i can feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">the tiredness of the day kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">descending upon me</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know how you bring that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">up more yeah yeah yeah so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">explore that a little bit in the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">guidance</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">with the energy body if at least for</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">this part</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just a matter of tuning in whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">it feels good or bad or however it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">um and so it sounds like you are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">have pretty easy access to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">that kind of field but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">question of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">how to sort of nudge it towards</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.559" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a state of tiredness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.559" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">that makes sense cool well we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">what happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">in the next yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">everybody else just have a comment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">it seems as i&#39;m doing this like um</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">like uh an eyeball looking in 360</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">degrees like just</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">trying to stretch everything everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to not just be out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">like the front facing</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">you totally yeah yeah i find that i have</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">to work harder to kind of fill in</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">towards the back like there&#39;s a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">for me to want to like</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:23.919" style="s2">sense the energy in front more</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s good to try to do the full</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.919" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">full 360. yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">great so everybody feels oh yeah come on</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">yes there&#39;s a way that my sensations</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:49.039" style="s2">feel vague</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if i mean i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:53.440" style="s2">know if they can&#39;t compare</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">phenomenologically with other humans but</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">um wondering if i should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">also reaching for more clarity</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">and specificity in my awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">sensation</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">or if it&#39;s okay to have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">like global</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">yeah yeah so this practice tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.919" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">more global</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">and kind of whole body and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">um less concerned with like</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">some practices are very concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">like the particular arising and passing</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">away of the particular sensations here</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:29.119" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">trying to get more of like a big picture</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.119" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">just like sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">of the field as it&#39;s sort of morphing</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">and turning and doing its thing um</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">as you spend more time with this</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">practice the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">brightness or clarity or vividness will</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">tend to increase</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">but you shouldn&#39;t try to increase it</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">it will just increase as you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">steep in it and spend more time there</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.679" style="s2">um you&#39;ll find even in this next guided</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:34:57.679" style="s2">practice like</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">it will become more clear as you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">breathe with it and sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">steepen it and fall into it and all that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">yeah but don&#39;t don&#39;t try to increase</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">the clarity although sometimes you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">take the image of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">turning up the dimmer switch like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:18.640" style="s2">can just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">take that image like i&#39;m going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">up the lights</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">and all sudden it&#39;ll become brighter and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">more vivid but don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">try to force it or anything yeah you say</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">global but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">the body yes yes yes yes indeed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">global to the body yeah not yeah don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">don&#39;t put your attention or awareness</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">too far out like more more than like two</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">inches or so beyond the body</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">yeah good thank you for clarifying that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">okay you all ready for a slightly deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">dive</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">okay drink some water</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.500" end="00:36:06.139" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">so in this guidance we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.839" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">again open up the energy body and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">try a number of different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">nourish and harmonize and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">bring that energy body into</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">alignment and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">i&#39;m going to give a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">cues and you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">try them all out or you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">find one that feels really like it works</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">and just do that it&#39;s up to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.839" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">once again dropping into the body</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">tuning into the body</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">inviting yourself to relax inviting your</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">and when you feel ready stretching your</p>

<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">to cover this whole field</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">getting a kind of global sense</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">just as it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">again when your attention</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">stretching it back open again to cover</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">what kind of breath would feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">most nourishing</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">most supportive most helpful</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">you might ask this energy body how does</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">it want to be breathed</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">perhaps it will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">perhaps it won&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">try something you might</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">see how that feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">experimenting with breathing in whatever</p>

<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:38.319" style="s2">like it supports the feeling of</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.319" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">how does it feel to</p>

<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">perhaps the breath</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">comes in the body there and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">flows out into the rest of the space</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:20.559" style="s2">what how pleasurable is like the right</p>

<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.040" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">what you want to do is just</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">lean into whatever well-being is present</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll you can run the experiment like</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">right and so the way to</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">towards amplification of pleasure is</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:56.880" style="s2">through tuning into whatever is present</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to kind of like force it</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">what happened in between it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:40.400" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:43.520" style="s2">breathing and then coming back</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.400" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">you notice that if i go to sleep i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.520" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:54.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean so um</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">you know if you if you fell asleep it</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.240" end="01:02:57.440" style="s2">might be that</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">that&#39;s what your body kind of needs</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">um if</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:05.359" style="s2">you sometimes i&#39;ve noticed that my mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:08.720" style="s2">gets kind of starts</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.359" end="01:03:10.720" style="s2">sinking and there&#39;s this sort of cloudy</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:16.000" style="s2">fuzzy thing but it doesn&#39;t sound like</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.720" end="01:03:19.520" style="s2">that was what was happening for you</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.000" end="01:03:19.520" style="s2">i didn&#39;t even remember</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:25.440" style="s2">anything at the end</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">and then you were talking you said the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.440" end="01:03:30.640" style="s2">breathing oh</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:34.079" style="s2">oh right oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.640" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know yeah wow yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.079" end="01:03:37.520" style="s2">sounds sounds interesting yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:40.480" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.520" end="01:03:41.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve never experienced that hello cool</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.480" end="01:03:43.839" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.520" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">okay yeah let&#39;s see if it see what</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.839" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">happens next time</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.559" end="01:03:51.039" style="s2">very good</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:14.400" style="s2">and i couldn&#39;t find it then</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s like a little bit of relaxation</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.400" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">but mostly the breath just feels</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.440" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">bad breath feels bad yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.720" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">and the tightness</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.839" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">let go and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">yeah trying for so long</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:46.480" style="s2">yeah so um like with with tim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">question the idea is not to have like</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.480" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">an ecstatic experience it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:56.400" style="s2">sort of like relate</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:57.440" style="s2">to the body in such a way that it sort</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.400" end="01:05:01.440" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.440" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">leans towards well-being however much</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.440" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">is possible right now and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:08.240" style="s2">one way to frame it is that we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">of like training this</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.240" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">skill of leaning into well-being</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">and as you get better at that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">kind of discover</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">more of it you&#39;ll also perhaps work</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:22.480" style="s2">through some of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:24.079" style="s2">obstructions to pleasure and well-being</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.480" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">in your energy body</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.079" end="01:05:31.200" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll kind of build on that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:32.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s really vital to this whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.200" end="01:05:35.280" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.000" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">not to get ahead of yourself in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.280" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">process like yes it is possible to have</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:41.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:44.000" style="s2">very intense pleasure in meditation and</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.359" end="01:05:46.960" style="s2">you work with whatever&#39;s present now</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">by tuning in to whatever amount of</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.960" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">well-being whatever amount of relaxation</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">is present and letting that be enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">actually just really enjoying that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.160" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">whatever it is like it was just a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">mildest relaxation well-being like</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">what&#39;s it like to like really bask</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">in that little bit and not</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:13.119" style="s2">as so often we do and so often i</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">i did when i was in my cabin retreat</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.119" end="01:06:19.440" style="s2">said this isn&#39;t good enough</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:23.440" style="s2">this isn&#39;t enough i&#39;m not doing it right</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.440" end="01:06:26.079" style="s2">yada yada and that will</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.440" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the ways we we tend to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.079" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">sabotage the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">arising of well-being yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.319" end="01:06:41.839" style="s2">um shall we</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.440" end="01:06:42.799" style="s2">dive in again oh wait no we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.839" end="01:06:45.359" style="s2">have a little break</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:46.000" style="s2">yeah so um how do we do this in silence</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.359" end="01:06:48.000" style="s2">get some water</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.000" end="01:06:49.599" style="s2">go to the bathroom and then when</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.000" end="01:06:53.119" style="s2">everybody&#39;s returned we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.599" end="01:06:57.119" style="s2">we&#39;ll go again in this</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.119" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">last experiment this last</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.119" end="01:07:04.319" style="s2">period of practice</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:06.799" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna take what we&#39;ve been playing</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.319" end="01:07:06.799" style="s2">with and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.079" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">focus on a particular skill</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">that&#39;s um tuning in to pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.880" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">and i&#39;m gonna say a little bit of like</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:26.720" style="s2">just add a piece of conceptuality into</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:29.599" style="s2">the mix</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.720" end="01:07:31.200" style="s2">that might support you and your practice</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.599" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.200" end="01:07:38.720" style="s2">this triple of discernment</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:41.200" style="s2">attunement amplification</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.720" end="01:07:42.319" style="s2">and this is a way of describing how</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.200" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.319" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">functions one dynamic of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">whereby</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">one way of thinking of this is if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:54.839" style="s2">consider this energy body experience as</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:58.240" style="s2">a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.839" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">harmonic almost like tonal</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.240" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">way of experiencing the body right so</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:06.559" style="s2">there&#39;s like different</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">vibrations different tones different</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.559" end="01:08:10.160" style="s2">things kind of happening some of them</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">painful some of them pleasurable</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.160" end="01:08:13.599" style="s2">some of them neutral one thing you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.599" end="01:08:20.480" style="s2">with your attention is</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">discern out of that whole mix particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.480" end="01:08:27.520" style="s2">we might say frequencies</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">particular tones particular vibrations</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.520" end="01:08:34.239" style="s2">and in discerning them you can then</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.600" end="01:08:36.799" style="s2">tune into them again almost like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.239" end="01:08:40.239" style="s2">tuning the dial of a radio station</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.799" end="01:08:42.480" style="s2">or radio sort of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.239" end="01:08:44.799" style="s2">meet that particular frequency that</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.480" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">particular tone</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.799" end="01:08:52.799" style="s2">and in tuning to it it amplifies</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">it it sort of increases in volume in</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.799" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">your perception</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">this is true you might notice like</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:01.440" style="s2">um with actually almost anything that</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:04.239" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.440" end="01:09:06.239" style="s2">experience depending on how you relate</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:09.839" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.239" end="01:09:12.400" style="s2">but in this period of practice</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.839" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">if it&#39;s available to you if you want the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.400" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">invitation will be to</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:21.600" style="s2">sort of discern whatever quality</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:24.799" style="s2">might be very subtle of well-being or</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.600" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">relaxation there is in your experience</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.799" end="01:09:30.400" style="s2">and then tuning into it</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">which itself is a skill that you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.400" end="01:09:35.120" style="s2">learn over time</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.319" end="01:09:36.319" style="s2">tuning into it and then letting it or</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.120" end="01:09:40.239" style="s2">noticing</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.319" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">how it amplifies how it increases</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.239" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">and then as much as is possible giving</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">yourself to that</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">again you&#39;re tuning into</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.320" end="01:09:57.440" style="s2">life in this case we&#39;ll i&#39;ll be leading</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">it to</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.440" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">tune into well-being or a sense of like</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">pleasure in the body yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.280" end="01:10:14.239" style="s2">yes and</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:15.120" style="s2">if you know i start guiding this and</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.239" end="01:10:18.320" style="s2">you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.120" end="01:10:20.560" style="s2">actually i feel horrible and contracted</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">and that pleasure is completely</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.560" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">unavailable to me right now</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.280" end="01:10:32.640" style="s2">my experience is that like sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.360" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">i can sort of dive underneath the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.640" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">contraction and find a kind of quality</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.120" end="01:10:41.360" style="s2">of pleasure dive underneath the pain</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">other times it&#39;s more important for me</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.360" end="01:10:45.520" style="s2">to just</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:47.280" style="s2">be with that contraction</p>

<p begin="01:33:48.719" end="01:33:53.120" style="s2">right and so i want to be able to choose</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.600" end="01:33:53.920" style="s2">to amplify pleasure when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.120" end="01:33:56.480" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.920" end="01:33:58.480" style="s2">and i also want to be able to choose to</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.480" end="01:34:01.360" style="s2">work with contraction</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.480" end="01:34:02.960" style="s2">skillfully when that feels like the</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.360" end="01:34:04.960" style="s2">right thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.960" end="01:34:06.400" style="s2">and so when that was happening for you</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.960" end="01:34:08.639" style="s2">when you noticed that</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.400" end="01:34:10.159" style="s2">that was a kind of like choice point</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.639" end="01:34:11.840" style="s2">right i would consider that to be a</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.159" end="01:34:14.719" style="s2">choice point where you can say like</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.840" end="01:34:15.840" style="s2">am i going to lean into pleasure because</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.719" end="01:34:17.199" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.840" end="01:34:19.760" style="s2">for some reason what i want to do right</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.199" end="01:34:23.920" style="s2">now or am i going to like</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.760" end="01:34:25.040" style="s2">explore this in my belly right and</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.920" end="01:34:28.080" style="s2">you know there are many different</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.040" end="01:34:29.440" style="s2">modalities you could you could do both</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.080" end="01:34:31.360" style="s2">and you could do both sometimes you</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.440" end="01:34:32.960" style="s2">might lean into the contraction try to</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.360" end="01:34:34.159" style="s2">like relate to that in a way that opens</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.960" end="01:34:37.600" style="s2">it up and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.159" end="01:34:40.159" style="s2">actually the well-being flows more</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.600" end="01:34:41.199" style="s2">completely or you could just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.159" end="01:34:45.360" style="s2">ignore it for a bit</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.199" end="01:34:47.040" style="s2">you know so you can experiment but</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.360" end="01:34:48.560" style="s2">in this in this practice we were doing</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.040" end="01:34:50.480" style="s2">it was the kind of correct</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.560" end="01:34:53.199" style="s2">move in the context that i was setting</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.480" end="01:34:56.080" style="s2">to go up here and enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.199" end="01:34:57.360" style="s2">um but in your daily practice you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.080" end="01:35:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.360" end="01:35:04.719" style="s2">up to you yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.760" end="01:35:07.040" style="s2">yeah typically there will be contraction</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.719" end="01:35:08.639" style="s2">in the body unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.040" end="01:35:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve had a very good day or something</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.639" end="01:35:17.600" style="s2">i guess</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.480" end="01:35:18.320" style="s2">an experience that i had earlier in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.600" end="01:35:21.679" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.320" end="01:35:27.679" style="s2">um showed up</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.679" end="01:35:31.199" style="s2">a lot yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.679" end="01:35:35.440" style="s2">and so you&#39;re experiencing pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.199" end="01:35:40.639" style="s2">and contraction and then this</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.440" end="01:35:44.960" style="s2">person it&#39;s almost confusing</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.639" end="01:35:48.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay i&#39;m trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.960" end="01:35:48.080" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.600" end="01:35:52.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m saying except for</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.639" end="01:35:55.760" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.880" end="01:35:58.080" style="s2">team is you said go with what is and</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.760" end="01:35:58.080" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.040" end="01:36:04.159" style="s2">yeah yeah and often i find that like</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.400" end="01:36:08.239" style="s2">typically when i do my evening practice</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.239" end="01:36:11.119" style="s2">i&#39;ll sit down and like</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.239" end="01:36:12.239" style="s2">intend to do this sort of practice where</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.119" end="01:36:14.080" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.239" end="01:36:15.760" style="s2">cultivating well-being and what shows up</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.080" end="01:36:17.199" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.760" end="01:36:18.960" style="s2">the thing that i said to that person</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.199" end="01:36:19.679" style="s2">earlier in the day that actually wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.960" end="01:36:22.000" style="s2">so nice</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.679" end="01:36:23.520" style="s2">and you know how i forgot to do this</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.000" end="01:36:26.719" style="s2">other thing and</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.520" end="01:36:29.280" style="s2">this pain in my and then i i have</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.719" end="01:36:31.679" style="s2">or i i have to work through that and</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.280" end="01:36:33.840" style="s2">then the flow can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.679" end="01:36:34.719" style="s2">happen and part of this part of what</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.840" end="01:36:38.000" style="s2">ends up being</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.719" end="01:36:40.159" style="s2">in the umbrella of skills within</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.000" end="01:36:41.040" style="s2">this context of practice is actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.159" end="01:36:42.960" style="s2">learning how to</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.040" end="01:36:44.880" style="s2">more and more quickly more and more</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.960" end="01:36:47.840" style="s2">skillfully work through those</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.880" end="01:36:49.920" style="s2">obstructions those contractions so that</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.840" end="01:36:53.199" style="s2">the flow of energy can really</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.920" end="01:36:54.639" style="s2">take over and send</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.199" end="01:36:57.280" style="s2">up a nice incentive structure because</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.639" end="01:37:00.000" style="s2">the quicker you can</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.280" end="01:37:01.040" style="s2">release those the sooner you can just</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.000" end="01:37:07.840" style="s2">relax</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.040" end="01:37:07.840" style="s2">into pleasure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.560" end="01:37:12.159" style="s2">something that&#39;s interesting as part of</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.280" end="01:37:15.679" style="s2">my experience</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.159" end="01:37:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like the sense of like</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.679" end="01:37:23.679" style="s2">energy swirling or like moving around</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.880" end="01:37:23.679" style="s2">huh um and like</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.840" end="01:37:30.239" style="s2">um depending on</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.960" end="01:37:32.080" style="s2">like which part of my body my attention</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.239" end="01:37:35.440" style="s2">is contracting to</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.080" end="01:37:38.080" style="s2">when like further expanding it just like</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.440" end="01:37:39.920" style="s2">almost takes a life is it of its own</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.080" end="01:37:42.800" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.920" end="01:37:44.080" style="s2">what what takes the life of the swirling</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.800" end="01:37:46.840" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.080" end="01:37:49.119" style="s2">in the whole body or in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.840" end="01:37:52.400" style="s2">part it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.119" end="01:37:55.119" style="s2">along the central axis mostly yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.400" end="01:37:55.600" style="s2">cool and so it&#39;s totally rad to just</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.119" end="01:37:58.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.600" end="01:37:59.600" style="s2">lose yourself in that swirl and just</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.320" end="01:38:02.159" style="s2">sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.600" end="01:38:03.920" style="s2">let that take over that&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.159" end="01:38:06.960" style="s2">thing to do and</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.920" end="01:38:09.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s fun that&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.960" end="01:38:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s cool that&#39;s really good i love that</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.760" end="01:38:12.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.239" end="01:38:19.280" style="s2">jeffrey yeah the usual teaching that</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.800" end="01:38:24.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.280" end="01:38:24.000" style="s2">heard is that</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.360" end="01:38:30.400" style="s2">happiness is usually conditional about</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.320" end="01:38:34.320" style="s2">something that you&#39;re happy about</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.400" end="01:38:37.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind of localization of</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.320" end="01:38:42.000" style="s2">pleasure and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.520" end="01:38:45.360" style="s2">attempt to repeat it kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.000" end="01:38:49.040" style="s2">that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.360" end="01:38:52.080" style="s2">has an addictive diminishing return</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.040" end="01:38:57.040" style="s2">process for pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.080" end="01:39:00.880" style="s2">because as william blake said</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.040" end="01:39:04.480" style="s2">he who binds to himself a joy</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.880" end="01:39:09.440" style="s2">dot the wind life destroy</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.480" end="01:39:14.000" style="s2">but he who kisses the joy as it flies</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.440" end="01:39:14.000" style="s2">lives in eternity&#39;s sunrise</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.040" end="01:39:18.719" style="s2">and usually there&#39;s this talk about</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.119" end="01:39:22.400" style="s2">clinging</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.719" end="01:39:26.480" style="s2">and trying to grasp and that that</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.400" end="01:39:29.600" style="s2">causes our contraction and suffering and</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.480" end="01:39:34.080" style="s2">so the way you began your talk</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.600" end="01:39:36.239" style="s2">it challenges that kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.080" end="01:39:36.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.639" end="01:39:43.679" style="s2">when you guided us i felt that you were</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.920" end="01:39:46.800" style="s2">asking us to</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.679" end="01:39:49.280" style="s2">focus on pleasure as you said for no</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.800" end="01:39:49.280" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.280" end="01:39:56.639" style="s2">and that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.320" end="01:39:58.159" style="s2">like i remember this song by donovan</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.639" end="01:40:00.560" style="s2">having it</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.159" end="01:40:02.800" style="s2">i think it&#39;s donovan happiness runs in a</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.560" end="01:40:05.040" style="s2">circular motion</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.800" end="01:40:06.719" style="s2">thought is just a little boat upon the</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.040" end="01:40:10.960" style="s2">sea</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.719" end="01:40:14.000" style="s2">all our souls are deeper than we can see</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.960" end="01:40:17.760" style="s2">and you can have everything</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.000" end="01:40:22.800" style="s2">if you let yourself be</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.760" end="01:40:25.520" style="s2">cause happiness runs in a circle</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.800" end="01:40:25.840" style="s2">if you try to define happiness it starts</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.520" end="01:40:29.600" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.840" end="01:40:29.600" style="s2">turn into the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.920" end="01:40:34.960" style="s2">neurosis fear of loss of happiness</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.679" end="01:40:39.360" style="s2">doubt if you&#39;re worthy because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.000" end="01:40:43.040" style="s2">slipping away</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.360" end="01:40:47.600" style="s2">all these kind of things but from what i</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.040" end="01:40:51.040" style="s2">also heard from the yoga teachers is</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.600" end="01:40:55.040" style="s2">that concentration is called dharna</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.040" end="01:40:58.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s the step before dion</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.040" end="01:41:02.639" style="s2">which is actual meditation</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.880" end="01:41:05.119" style="s2">and then samadhi emerges</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.639" end="01:41:06.719" style="s2">from the relation of that practice at</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.119" end="01:41:08.320" style="s2">those the highest levels of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.719" end="01:41:10.960" style="s2">eightfold yogas</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.320" end="01:41:10.960" style="s2">according to</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.440" end="01:41:17.360" style="s2">so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.600" end="01:41:23.520" style="s2">you become absorbed naturally</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.800" end="01:41:24.159" style="s2">first you have to make an effort to</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.520" end="01:41:27.679" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.159" end="01:41:29.119" style="s2">free of ambivalence and resolve your</p>
