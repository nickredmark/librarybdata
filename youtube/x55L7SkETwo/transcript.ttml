<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a thought I was thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">doing it on my channel but actually I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s better if it&#39;s a thing on its</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">own like I&#39;m not necessarily suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">this as a title but thoughts on game be</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">that kind of thing right where people</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">make maybe put a limit of five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:40.020" style="s2">on it I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m like in the 98th</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">percentile of openness so rules of any</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.020" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">kind or abhorrent to me right but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">put like a five minute limit on it</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">something like that so that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">waffle on too much and just I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">would be quite happy to curate this and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">so somebody put something up and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">somebody else comments on there and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">put it in a playlist so that they follow</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:00.290" style="s2">on sequentially from each other and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">this sort of thing built up into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.290" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">library of ideas and themes of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">which various people have contributed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">a thread of discussion you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">so a little bit like the Facebook page</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">you know if somebody puts up</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">post and then about commencing Reds as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:23.730" style="s2">consequence of that but but you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:25.080" style="s2">video contributions where where people</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.730" end="00:02:26.910" style="s2">actually sit in front of a camera and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.080" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">you know they can I all means use some</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.910" end="00:02:31.950" style="s2">graphics as well some music whatever put</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:33.990" style="s2">together you know a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.950" end="00:02:36.090" style="s2">artistry sometimes I think and really</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.990" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">you know can really bring the point home</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.090" end="00:02:41.460" style="s2">so yeah the genes-- need to express</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:43.110" style="s2">beyond just sitting and typing out</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.460" end="00:02:45.530" style="s2">little posts although it would be in</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.110" end="00:02:48.990" style="s2">many ways kind of similar structurally</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.530" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">mmhmm yeah I like I enjoy video more</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.990" end="00:02:53.750" style="s2">than type you know which is why I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:57.540" style="s2">super active in the Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.750" end="00:03:00.330" style="s2">because I find the written word isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.540" end="00:03:03.180" style="s2">great at expressing role Omega for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.330" end="00:03:06.500" style="s2">anyway like it it&#39;s reading into what</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.180" end="00:03:08.790" style="s2">people say and not I feel I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.500" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">express my it&#39;s not that I can&#39;t express</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.790" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">myself in the written word it&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:14.700" style="s2">prefer to do it on video or there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:17.340" style="s2">nuance and I can understand the person</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.700" end="00:03:19.350" style="s2">and hopefully get my point across and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.340" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">kind of read the other person and see if</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.350" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">it&#39;s landing in it and you can clarify</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">in the moment and you get tone and body</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:26.820" style="s2">language and all of that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">no and I I agree with you the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">advantage that the written word has over</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">that kind of communication is you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:37.140" style="s2">chance to really consider exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:39.270" style="s2">you want to say something right whereas</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.140" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">in the moment you&#39;re very much on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.270" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">fly right and and and although you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:44.160" style="s2">good faith you may be not expressing</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:45.630" style="s2">yourself as clearly as you would do with</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.160" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">a bit of chance to really think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.630" end="00:03:49.650" style="s2">how he wants to say that so the written</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:53.010" style="s2">word is good for that but but in terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.650" end="00:03:53.930" style="s2">of generative discussion I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.010" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">you face to face</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.930" end="00:04:03.900" style="s2">you&#39;re also I although I have my moments</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">I feel that even sitting with it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.900" end="00:04:08.910" style="s2">get more articulate because I either</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:10.500" style="s2">just second-guess it and I&#39;m like wait</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.910" end="00:04:15.209" style="s2">no that doesn&#39;t quite make sense or I</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.500" end="00:04:16.919" style="s2">put so much background and like caveats</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.209" end="00:04:19.980" style="s2">that it kind of makes it almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.919" end="00:04:22.620" style="s2">unreadable like this piece and at least</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.980" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">in language like spoken language went on</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.620" end="00:04:27.110" style="s2">doing that when I can stop it sentence</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:29.419" style="s2">and just go back</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.110" end="00:04:31.550" style="s2">it&#39;s also like realize it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.419" end="00:04:33.949" style="s2">because of body language would be like</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.550" end="00:04:35.569" style="s2">okay maybe I don&#39;t need to answer every</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.949" end="00:04:37.610" style="s2">question because I can see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.569" end="00:04:39.860" style="s2">landing right I don&#39;t need to think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.610" end="00:04:41.479" style="s2">the six questions I&#39;m sure you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.860" end="00:04:43.789" style="s2">based on the thing I just said and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.479" end="00:04:45.379" style="s2">answer them all at the same time mmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.789" end="00:04:47.000" style="s2">yeah I see you mean I see so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.379" end="00:04:48.229" style="s2">anticipating what the reader might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.000" end="00:04:50.090" style="s2">responding to what you said and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.229" end="00:04:51.800" style="s2">trying to answer that rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:57.189" style="s2">saying what you want to say yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.800" end="00:05:00.229" style="s2">yeah yes that must be a real tangle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.189" end="00:05:03.050" style="s2">for sure I love what you wrote I read</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.229" end="00:05:04.610" style="s2">half of it and then you posted it in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.050" end="00:05:06.889" style="s2">I was like great I have to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.610" end="00:05:08.719" style="s2">read it yeah the version I posted is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.889" end="00:05:09.979" style="s2">considerably more polished than the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.719" end="00:05:11.210" style="s2">I sent you I kind of got a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.979" end="00:05:13.099" style="s2">stuck I&#39;ve been working on it for a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.210" end="00:05:14.810" style="s2">days and I kind of got a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.099" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">stuck where I wasn&#39;t entirely happy with</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.810" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">it and I knew it wasn&#39;t quite how I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:20.719" style="s2">wanted to say but I couldn&#39;t quite put</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:21.860" style="s2">my finger on what it was and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.719" end="00:05:24.199" style="s2">because I was so immersed in it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.860" end="00:05:25.430" style="s2">really really hard for me to step back</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.199" end="00:05:27.800" style="s2">and see it anymore you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.430" end="00:05:30.139" style="s2">so I sent it out to a few people to just</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.800" end="00:05:32.599" style="s2">try and get some feedback you know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.139" end="00:05:34.009" style="s2">what did they think of it and yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.599" end="00:05:35.810" style="s2">couple of bits of feedback that I got</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.009" end="00:05:37.430" style="s2">were actually really helpful and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.810" end="00:05:39.710" style="s2">pointed me in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.430" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">things that had been bugging me and I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:43.219" style="s2">think I was able to polish it off a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">little bit so yeah the version that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.219" end="00:05:48.020" style="s2">posted I&#39;m pretty I&#39;m pretty happy I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:49.250" style="s2">mean you never 100% NamUs or you say</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.020" end="00:05:51.050" style="s2">probably not very much from what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.250" end="00:05:52.879" style="s2">just said but I&#39;ve done a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.050" end="00:05:55.129" style="s2">writing and I find that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.879" end="00:05:58.129" style="s2">polish it and you polish it and you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.129" end="00:05:59.629" style="s2">to a point where every time you really</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.129" end="00:06:01.789" style="s2">all you&#39;re actually doing is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.629" end="00:06:03.080" style="s2">inserting a comma but it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.789" end="00:06:04.909" style="s2">be there you know what I mean it could</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.080" end="00:06:06.169" style="s2">be with or without a comma and at some</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.909" end="00:06:08.599" style="s2">point you&#39;re just for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.169" end="00:06:11.270" style="s2">tinkering you got to let it go even</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.599" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">though you feel you know maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.270" end="00:06:14.900" style="s2">perfect so yeah anyway yeah it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:17.629" style="s2">as you can probably tell actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.900" end="00:06:21.610" style="s2">become a little bit become quite ended</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.629" end="00:06:29.389" style="s2">up becoming quite a personal personal</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.610" end="00:06:32.270" style="s2">yeah that makes sense yeah yeah how much</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.389" end="00:06:33.949" style="s2">of it is held in each individual person</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.270" end="00:06:36.469" style="s2">and how much of it is a group thing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.949" end="00:06:39.729" style="s2">how much of it is like you said source</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.469" end="00:06:40.950" style="s2">like something we go back to and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.729" end="00:06:42.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.950" end="00:06:44.220" style="s2">I was looking for when I first got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.360" end="00:06:45.900" style="s2">gain B I&#39;m like what are the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.220" end="00:06:48.450" style="s2">checklist right like what makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:51.030" style="s2">something gain B or not game B that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.450" end="00:06:52.260" style="s2">on and that it&#39;s and that might never be</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.030" end="00:06:55.860" style="s2">the case there might never be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.260" end="00:06:57.360" style="s2">checklist because let&#39;s say there&#39;s 10</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.860" end="00:06:59.460" style="s2">things on the checklist well if you meet</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.360" end="00:07:03.630" style="s2">9 out of the 10 is it not game B is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.460" end="00:07:05.970" style="s2">yeah but that whole modality of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.630" end="00:07:07.230" style="s2">of checking off things on that&#39;s game a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.970" end="00:07:11.630" style="s2">though right I mean that that whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.230" end="00:07:14.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s structural definitional</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.630" end="00:07:16.050" style="s2">algorithmic you know what I mean testing</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.250" end="00:07:18.210" style="s2">whether or not is we&#39;re testing whether</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:20.850" style="s2">or not is something is game B by using</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.210" end="00:07:24.630" style="s2">game a methodology that seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.850" end="00:07:29.880" style="s2">be and it is it is hard not to because</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.630" end="00:07:31.170" style="s2">we all hold our whole lives right almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.880" end="00:07:35.460" style="s2">impossible not to yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.170" end="00:07:38.660" style="s2">absolutely and so whereas I I come to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.460" end="00:07:40.860" style="s2">game B in a different way where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.660" end="00:07:42.750" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like nobody knows what game B</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.860" end="00:07:44.220" style="s2">is I&#39;m like I do I do know what game B</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.750" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">is I&#39;ve been sitting with it for three</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.220" end="00:07:47.850" style="s2">years playing it by myself because no</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:49.470" style="s2">one else wants to play it with me which</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.850" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">of course isn&#39;t game be it can&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.470" end="00:07:55.350" style="s2">someone&#39;s head it has to be real most</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:57.690" style="s2">interactions and relationships but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.350" end="00:07:59.670" style="s2">like I kind of know how we get a way I</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">don&#39;t anyway we can get to date me and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.670" end="00:08:03.540" style="s2">all the things that can go wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.640" style="s2">or about playing it and fixing it as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.540" end="00:08:08.430" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.640" end="00:08:11.160" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t so popular in the space okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.430" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming as you go because but</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.160" end="00:08:14.850" style="s2">because the one thing that you hold on</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:16.350" style="s2">to is that directionality right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.850" end="00:08:18.540" style="s2">in order in order to do that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.350" end="00:08:20.010" style="s2">have a clear sense it doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.540" end="00:08:22.320" style="s2">can say it doesn&#39;t mean you can write it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.010" end="00:08:25.470" style="s2">down but it but you&#39;ve got within you a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.320" end="00:08:26.730" style="s2">clear sense of the directionality you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.470" end="00:08:28.680" style="s2">know what I mean and that&#39;s what sauce</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.730" end="00:08:31.770" style="s2">is for me that&#39;s exactly what sauce is</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.680" end="00:08:33.450" style="s2">is is is that thing which you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.770" end="00:08:35.820" style="s2">but which you know you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.450" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">you you know it and you feel when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.820" end="00:08:38.490" style="s2">going in that direction and you also</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">feel when you&#39;re not going in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.490" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">direction and you maybe can&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:46.350" style="s2">why but you just it just doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:47.880" style="s2">right ya know and that because that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.350" end="00:08:49.170" style="s2">piece that little piece of it not</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.880" end="00:08:51.420" style="s2">feeling right can be different for</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.170" end="00:08:52.770" style="s2">different people right like it feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.420" end="00:08:53.830" style="s2">right for you does it mean it feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.770" end="00:08:56.550" style="s2">right for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.830" end="00:08:59.260" style="s2">but the more we work together the more</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.550" end="00:09:00.820" style="s2">probably it&#39;s cohesive right probably if</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.260" end="00:09:02.440" style="s2">it&#39;s all new and for me it&#39;s Omni one</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.820" end="00:09:04.899" style="s2">for you and part of being on me when</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.440" end="00:09:06.790" style="s2">it&#39;s listening to you and hearing is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.899" end="00:09:07.269" style="s2">Omni when right like does this work for</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.790" end="00:09:11.589" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.269" end="00:09:14.470" style="s2">and not demanding that it does right or</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.589" end="00:09:16.089" style="s2">it&#39;s Mandy that it does it like meeting</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.470" end="00:09:19.540" style="s2">the individual where they&#39;re at and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.089" end="00:09:21.310" style="s2">asking what works what doesn&#39;t work how</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.540" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">can we improve it for you even if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.310" end="00:09:26.470" style="s2">don&#39;t owe you that right actually want</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:27.790" style="s2">here what do you actually want here</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.470" end="00:09:29.740" style="s2">right that&#39;s that I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.790" end="00:09:30.970" style="s2">really key thing to drill down to and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.740" end="00:09:33.220" style="s2">that can sometimes not be easy to find</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.970" end="00:09:34.630" style="s2">right people what people come into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.220" end="00:09:35.649" style="s2">thing thinking that they want is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.630" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">actually what they want but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.649" end="00:09:39.430" style="s2">actually want is something deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:42.550" style="s2">that you know some meet need that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.430" end="00:09:44.529" style="s2">being met that this thing is related to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.550" end="00:09:46.540" style="s2">but not actually the thing itself you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.529" end="00:09:48.310" style="s2">know and that that need to be met more</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.540" end="00:09:50.890" style="s2">effectively in some way that they simply</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.310" end="00:09:53.410" style="s2">hadn&#39;t thought of right and so drilling</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.890" end="00:09:55.390" style="s2">down into what people actually want from</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.410" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">a thing I think is really really really</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.390" end="00:09:59.050" style="s2">important I can&#39;t remember where I heard</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:00.220" style="s2">that but it really struck home with me</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.050" end="00:10:02.649" style="s2">was it someone talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.220" end="00:10:05.220" style="s2">negotiations right that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.649" end="00:10:08.589" style="s2">you&#39;re starting ponta negotiations is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.220" end="00:10:10.899" style="s2">what foundational principles can we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.589" end="00:10:14.950" style="s2">agree on here and be what do we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.899" end="00:10:16.209" style="s2">actually want out of this yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.950" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">can get to that if you can get to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.209" end="00:10:20.890" style="s2">truth of that then it&#39;s almost really</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s almost always really easy to come</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.890" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">up with something that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">really happy with yeah in my community</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">which is like most people get most of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:33.579" style="s2">what they want most of the time and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:35.050" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good goal to obtain right</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.579" end="00:10:37.630" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna get everything they want</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.050" end="00:10:39.940" style="s2">all of the time they don&#39;t get stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.630" end="00:10:41.709" style="s2">may want all of the time it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.940" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">most of it I don&#39;t get most of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.709" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">because a group isn&#39;t going to give you</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:49.300" style="s2">everything and I think also with our</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">current global society like what one</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.300" end="00:10:53.260" style="s2">group doesn&#39;t give you maybe another</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:56.440" style="s2">group can write that you can you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.260" end="00:10:58.269" style="s2">need to get everything from one group of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.440" end="00:11:01.240" style="s2">people but how do we meet each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.269" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">needs as individuals as small groups and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.240" end="00:11:07.570" style="s2">as a global efficient body that yeah I</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.320" end="00:12:30.070" style="s2">schema for me a little bit so that</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.210" end="00:13:36.070" style="s2">with up 250 people and I think with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.090" end="00:13:38.260" style="s2">internet and with our global society</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.070" end="00:13:41.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve already expanded on that</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.470" end="00:13:52.990" style="s2">that it&#39;s not going to be one cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.590" end="00:13:55.060" style="s2">group it&#39;s gonna be you know like 50</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.990" end="00:13:56.980" style="s2">people in my church or 50 people at my</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.060" end="00:13:59.740" style="s2">school or 50 people in my community and</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.050" end="00:14:07.570" style="s2">own their own it&#39;s like a Venn diagram</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.350" end="00:14:08.980" style="s2">right there&#39;s some overlap between your</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.570" end="00:14:10.270" style="s2">church community your school community</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.980" end="00:14:11.650" style="s2">and your local community there is some</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.270" end="00:14:14.260" style="s2">overlap there right but there is also</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.650" end="00:14:15.790" style="s2">some which is which does not overlap</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.260" end="00:14:21.670" style="s2">I like the Venn diagram thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.790" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">that represents it well right but ya</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.670" end="00:14:27.460" style="s2">know absolutely overlays of overlays of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:29.770" style="s2">overlays again it&#39;s relationship right</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.460" end="00:14:32.740" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s relationships across all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.770" end="00:14:34.570" style="s2">of different levels all scales yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.740" end="00:14:38.460" style="s2">we&#39;re very much on the same page aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.460" end="00:14:44.050" style="s2">think we&#39;re I don&#39;t know if we all need</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.580" end="00:14:45.880" style="s2">to concentrate on that but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.050" end="00:14:48.340" style="s2">finding your own individual like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.880" end="00:14:50.200" style="s2">everyone has a space to give from and</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:55.290" style="s2">still working it&#39;s still here and still</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.910" end="00:17:59.670" style="s2">keeping the food in the supermarket it</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.290" end="00:18:01.590" style="s2">still has and so we can fix it from</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.670" end="00:18:03.780" style="s2">within that space and so we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.590" end="00:18:06.690" style="s2">to recreate everything all at once so</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.780" end="00:18:08.580" style="s2">let&#39;s say what I think of is the way to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.690" end="00:18:10.830" style="s2">path to game B is I&#39;m creating a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.580" end="00:18:13.020" style="s2">technology cooperative it gets all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.830" end="00:18:14.760" style="s2">our needs met it gets all of our like</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.020" end="00:18:15.960" style="s2">every individual can come to the table</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.760" end="00:18:17.700" style="s2">and say what they need we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.960" end="00:18:19.230" style="s2">obligated to give it to you but we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.700" end="00:18:22.350" style="s2">give you the tools to co-create it with</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.230" end="00:18:23.640" style="s2">a group of people right and so from that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.350" end="00:18:27.140" style="s2">space that kind of lost my train of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.640" end="00:18:29.670" style="s2">thought here from that space you&#39;re I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.140" end="00:18:32.550" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I was going to say to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.670" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">people what what they need and giving it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.550" end="00:18:44.970" style="s2">to them and read everything so if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.200" style="s2">have a business you don&#39;t this isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.970" end="00:18:48.210" style="s2">cult you don&#39;t need to hand your</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.200" end="00:18:49.950" style="s2">business over at the same time play a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.210" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">little bit and can&#39;t beat it like</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.950" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">anything you co-create with a group</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:55.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve been given the tools to co-create</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">with that belongs to the comments right</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.800" end="00:18:58.980" style="s2">like having and then when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:00.360" style="s2">conflict because oh I thought this was</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.980" end="00:19:02.460" style="s2">gonna be mine and instead it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.360" end="00:19:03.960" style="s2">the Commons like owning that piece and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.460" end="00:19:05.640" style="s2">you like right so how do we make sure in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.960" end="00:19:08.430" style="s2">the future this is very laid out how do</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.640" end="00:19:11.160" style="s2">we make sure like only mistakes is or</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.430" end="00:19:15.810" style="s2">like challenges as they happen and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.160" end="00:19:17.550" style="s2">figuring it out and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.810" end="00:19:19.380" style="s2">something cool about coming out of game</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.550" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">a and that we have to out-compete it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.380" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">we will naturally out-compete it because</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:28.340" style="s2">it&#39;s so broken and yet it works enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:28.340" style="s2">that like we have a space to play in</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:37.380" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re more optimistic than I am I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:40.170" style="s2">mean my vision my ultimate vision is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.380" end="00:19:45.900" style="s2">extremely optimistic right but the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.170" end="00:19:50.540" style="s2">prospects of us actually morphing game a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.900" end="00:19:50.540" style="s2">into game being some kind of organic</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.840" end="00:19:57.140" style="s2">peaceful not too disruptive and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.390" end="00:19:59.640" style="s2">destructive manner I</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.140" end="00:20:01.409" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m less optimistic about that than</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.640" end="00:20:04.509" style="s2">you are let&#39;s put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.409" end="00:20:06.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve sorry heard a couple of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.509" end="00:20:08.440" style="s2">recently say including that Brazilian</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.490" end="00:20:11.019" style="s2">guy upon remember his name bonito posted</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.440" end="00:20:14.740" style="s2">a link to his video really really cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.019" end="00:20:17.559" style="s2">guy his name escapes me anyway that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.740" end="00:20:19.990" style="s2">people don&#39;t change until they have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.559" end="00:20:22.980" style="s2">right and and III just think until</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.990" end="00:20:26.379" style="s2">things get really bad until game a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.980" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">actually breaks and is seen to break and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.379" end="00:20:32.649" style="s2">its failings are you know obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:34.899" style="s2">undeniably exposed because it&#39;s falling</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.649" end="00:20:38.110" style="s2">apart and it&#39;s in tatters now until then</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.899" end="00:20:39.369" style="s2">I mean not unless optimistic listen I</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.110" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">hope you&#39;re right I hope you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.369" end="00:20:45.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve continued to fight the good fight</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:52.990" style="s2">right but III yeah don&#39;t show your I am</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.970" end="00:20:55.090" style="s2">NOT realest person but from that space I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.990" end="00:20:56.740" style="s2">have created in my head a way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.090" end="00:20:59.049" style="s2">actually get there working with our</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.740" end="00:21:00.759" style="s2">within our human nature and working with</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.049" end="00:21:03.519" style="s2">out competing gay made its own the space</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.759" end="00:21:05.409" style="s2">and so I have that vision in that hope</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.519" end="00:21:07.570" style="s2">because it&#39;s working within that sphere</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.409" end="00:21:09.549" style="s2">right it&#39;s not requiring people be</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.570" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">selfless when there clearly can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.549" end="00:21:13.240" style="s2">selfish it&#39;s not requiring everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:15.970" style="s2">Bueller cooperative when they also like</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.240" end="00:21:19.659" style="s2">competition it&#39;s but it&#39;s creating a</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.970" end="00:21:21.309" style="s2">space that is based on cooperation right</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.659" end="00:21:22.929" style="s2">it&#39;s not saying you&#39;re a bad person if</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.309" end="00:21:26.529" style="s2">you&#39;re competing well maybe I think you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.929" end="00:21:29.139" style="s2">are but it&#39;s saying like this space is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.529" end="00:21:30.730" style="s2">for cooperation right here you like if</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.139" end="00:21:32.860" style="s2">you&#39;re working a 40-hour a week job</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.730" end="00:21:35.619" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re working here one hour leak</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.860" end="00:21:38.049" style="s2">right and as you see it benefit right as</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.619" end="00:21:41.019" style="s2">you see things that are created that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.049" end="00:21:43.029" style="s2">omni wind that benefit everybody that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.019" end="00:21:45.999" style="s2">all own together and we all have a say</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.029" end="00:21:48.039" style="s2">in creating then you&#39;re gonna it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.999" end="00:21:50.980" style="s2">prove itself to you right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.039" end="00:21:53.799" style="s2">because i love a lot of the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.980" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">are about collapse and then we created a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.799" end="00:22:03.610" style="s2">girl and I hate the collapse piece I</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:22:06.539" style="s2">don&#39;t want yeah and that&#39;s where like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.610" end="00:22:09.220" style="s2">think globally yes but personally we</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.539" end="00:22:12.850" style="s2">will have collapse right like there it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.220" end="00:22:14.830" style="s2">comes with them like through meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.850" end="00:22:19.210" style="s2">through spiritual work through any</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.830" end="00:22:20.860" style="s2">it&#39;s claps right but the world doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.210" end="00:22:22.840" style="s2">collapse hopefully we can support each</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.860" end="00:22:24.460" style="s2">other in that I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.840" end="00:22:26.919" style="s2">especially in the game bSpace have come</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.460" end="00:22:29.890" style="s2">to this space through collapse through</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.919" end="00:22:33.640" style="s2">health issues through just like personal</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.890" end="00:22:35.320" style="s2">world shifting collapse you know she was</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.640" end="00:22:37.750" style="s2">right like your paradigm collapses and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.320" end="00:22:39.250" style="s2">you need a new one you have the more we</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.750" end="00:22:40.539" style="s2">can create the ways to support each</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.250" end="00:22:43.090" style="s2">other where it doesn&#39;t need to go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.539" end="00:22:46.360" style="s2">zero right like our system doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.090" end="00:22:48.760" style="s2">to collapse it is collapsing right our</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.360" end="00:22:50.889" style="s2">current system is on trajectory to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.760" end="00:22:52.809" style="s2">off the cliff and so the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.889" end="00:22:54.519" style="s2">kind of own that but also own that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.809" end="00:22:57.010" style="s2">doing something right like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.519" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">the hospitals to go under I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.010" end="00:22:59.950" style="s2">food not to be in the supermarkets</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:04.149" style="s2">before we figure out how to not need</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.950" end="00:23:08.679" style="s2">food news and yes interesting to see to</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.149" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">what degree individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.679" end="00:23:12.669" style="s2">plays a role there right so for given</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:13.990" style="s2">the giving the example of hospitals you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.669" end="00:23:16.389" style="s2">know if everything is breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.990" end="00:23:18.010" style="s2">around you and you know the money system</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.389" end="00:23:21.190" style="s2">collapses right money&#39;s not worth</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.010" end="00:23:23.320" style="s2">anything anymore for example do doctors</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.190" end="00:23:24.789" style="s2">and nurses still show up to work and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.320" end="00:23:26.620" style="s2">cure sick people you know I mean knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.789" end="00:23:29.320" style="s2">full well that they&#39;re never getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.620" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">paid again at the world I mean I I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.320" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">like to believe I don&#39;t know only the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">only only the situation would tell I</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:38.529" style="s2">would like to believe that many many</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:40.779" style="s2">many people would not just doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.529" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">nurses but you know farmers and drivers</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.779" end="00:23:45.250" style="s2">and whatever you know who have people</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:47.889" style="s2">that do that do actually essential stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.250" end="00:23:49.269" style="s2">I like to believe that we would figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.889" end="00:23:51.429" style="s2">it out you know what I mean that people</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.269" end="00:23:52.870" style="s2">would get together in exactly this kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.429" end="00:23:55.419" style="s2">of thing into little group to say all</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.870" end="00:23:56.620" style="s2">right listen things are up</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.419" end="00:23:58.299" style="s2">around here how are we going to sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.620" end="00:23:59.500" style="s2">this out people depend on us right how</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.299" end="00:24:02.649" style="s2">are we going to sort this out I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.500" end="00:24:04.450" style="s2">to believe that you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.649" end="00:24:06.100" style="s2">good road I think to gain be that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.450" end="00:24:07.929" style="s2">plays that forces us into the situation</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.100" end="00:24:12.149" style="s2">of having to create those relationships</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.929" end="00:24:14.549" style="s2">you know in response to our broader</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.149" end="00:24:17.220" style="s2">responsibility to the community at large</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.549" end="00:24:24.399" style="s2">you know it could force it like that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.220" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">think and not group not global collapse</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.399" end="00:24:28.659" style="s2">right like there has been times where</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:30.580" style="s2">currency has been so devalued and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.659" end="00:24:32.739" style="s2">hyperinflation we see how that works and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.580" end="00:24:34.239" style="s2">it&#39;s not great but there is ingenuity</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.739" end="00:24:36.009" style="s2">there for sure right people have black</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.239" end="00:24:38.139" style="s2">markets people figure out people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.009" end="00:24:39.999" style="s2">still alive in Venezuela people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.139" end="00:24:42.489" style="s2">still alive in Zimbabwe right they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.999" end="00:24:44.470" style="s2">still alive and in Germany they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.489" end="00:24:51.220" style="s2">big huge repercussions from those things</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.470" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">but having the way to build the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.220" end="00:24:56.169" style="s2">scaffolding under society so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">collapse so that we don&#39;t because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.169" end="00:24:59.529" style="s2">truth is is if it goes away tomorrow no</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:01.119" style="s2">people driving our food to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.529" end="00:25:03.009" style="s2">supermarket aren&#39;t going to show up when</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.119" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">you know I mean they&#39;re part of a system</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.009" end="00:25:07.720" style="s2">so like but food isn&#39;t there to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:09.429" style="s2">delivered the food isn&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.720" end="00:25:10.690" style="s2">farmers didn&#39;t necessarily the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.429" end="00:25:12.369" style="s2">are going to sell it directly to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.690" end="00:25:16.210" style="s2">consumer right it&#39;s gonna be a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.369" end="00:25:19.179" style="s2">complex and a lot more lapses and so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.210" end="00:25:21.460" style="s2">rely on complex complexity like I live</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.179" end="00:25:23.169" style="s2">in a big city I&#39;m not gonna I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.460" end="00:25:24.729" style="s2">a relationship with farmers right I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.169" end="00:25:26.889" style="s2">relationship with some people who garden</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.729" end="00:25:28.869" style="s2">but not enough to feed all of Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.889" end="00:25:32.139" style="s2">and the more then we can look at that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.869" end="00:25:34.119" style="s2">honestly and be like right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.139" end="00:25:36.070" style="s2">build that right let&#39;s build the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.119" end="00:25:37.509" style="s2">relationship direct with the farmers we</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.070" end="00:25:41.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have multinational huge</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.509" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">corporations taking over we have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.080" end="00:25:45.639" style="s2">ability for farmers to make a living or</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:47.559" style="s2">they also have to be transparent in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.639" end="00:25:50.409" style="s2">way that they&#39;re they&#39;re being stewards</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.559" end="00:25:52.899" style="s2">of the lands right that like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.409" end="00:25:54.909" style="s2">gonna give you my money as a farmer and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.899" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">trust you if I don&#39;t have access to like</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.909" end="00:25:57.700" style="s2">why should I trust you over</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:25:59.349" style="s2">multinational corporation right what are</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.700" end="00:26:00.609" style="s2">you giving me over a multinational</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.349" end="00:26:04.149" style="s2">corporation if you&#39;re giving me a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.609" end="00:26:05.109" style="s2">working planet and food sovereignty yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.149" end="00:26:06.700" style="s2">I want to work with you over</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.109" end="00:26:08.919" style="s2">multinational corporation if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.700" end="00:26:10.419" style="s2">still doing all the and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.919" end="00:26:12.039" style="s2">still costing me the same amount of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.419" end="00:26:13.960" style="s2">money and I&#39;m still eating the same crap</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.039" end="00:26:17.080" style="s2">food no I don&#39;t want to support you</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.960" end="00:26:19.450" style="s2">right like the more we can build it into</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.080" end="00:26:21.429" style="s2">the system the transparency it can it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.450" end="00:26:24.669" style="s2">can be integrated even more deeply than</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.429" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">there and I again I&#39;m quite open to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.669" end="00:26:28.659" style="s2">criticism of naivety and hey this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:30.220" style="s2">just never how it could possibly be in</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.659" end="00:26:31.599" style="s2">the real world but I think can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.220" end="00:26:33.999" style="s2">integrated even more deeply than that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.599" end="00:26:36.129" style="s2">rather than having farmers per se I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.999" end="00:26:39.339" style="s2">I don&#39;t see any reason why every single</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.129" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">member of these you know unitary</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.339" end="00:26:44.920" style="s2">communities these cbons can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:46.570" style="s2">we contribute to the production of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.920" end="00:26:50.800" style="s2">nutrition for the whole community I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.570" end="00:26:54.580" style="s2">the the the you know spending a couple</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.800" end="00:26:57.340" style="s2">of hours a week on growing something is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.580" end="00:26:59.640" style="s2">is is a not a big sacrifice be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.340" end="00:27:01.930" style="s2">pleasure and it you know it means that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.640" end="00:27:03.550" style="s2">you know you&#39;re growing the broccoli and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.930" end="00:27:05.710" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;ve got the chickens for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.550" end="00:27:07.870" style="s2">eggs and you whatever it might be you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.710" end="00:27:10.600" style="s2">know that it further integrates the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.870" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">community with each other and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.600" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">think this reflects the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:18.760" style="s2">integration of process across scale in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:20.650" style="s2">nature as well right the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.760" end="00:27:24.330" style="s2">is that we produce food in order for</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.650" end="00:27:27.310" style="s2">that to be as anti fragile and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.330" end="00:27:30.760" style="s2">sustainable and as generative and as in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.310" end="00:27:32.650" style="s2">you know as gluey and you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.760" end="00:27:35.410" style="s2">like gluing people do that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.650" end="00:27:37.330" style="s2">thing of gluing relationships together</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.410" end="00:27:39.670" style="s2">then that like everything else should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.330" end="00:27:41.320" style="s2">decentralized as much as makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.670" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">do so and I think with food production</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.320" end="00:27:45.490" style="s2">it actually makes sense to decentralize</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:46.930" style="s2">that all the way right down to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.490" end="00:27:49.030" style="s2">individual every individual has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.930" end="00:27:52.990" style="s2">contribution to make the food production</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.030" end="00:27:55.450" style="s2">why not I think especially for food we</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.990" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">all the contribution except for the tiny</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.450" end="00:28:00.370" style="s2">fraction of people who have something so</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:05.590" style="s2">fundamentally important to do that food</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.370" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">production way way way open nothing as</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.590" end="00:28:08.650" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned is absolute in</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.210" style="s2">second stone and you know and completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.650" end="00:28:12.340" style="s2">immune from circumstance yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.210" end="00:28:14.110" style="s2">wasn&#39;t trying to suggest that yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.340" end="00:28:15.910" style="s2">my neurosurgeon and stuff you know like</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.110" end="00:28:18.520" style="s2">I&#39;m okay taking over their their piece</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.910" end="00:28:20.350" style="s2">of food production if they&#39;re cutting</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.520" end="00:28:23.590" style="s2">people open and saving their lives and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.350" end="00:28:25.680" style="s2">doing this is exactly the kind of guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.590" end="00:28:28.420" style="s2">who would do an excellent job of growing</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.680" end="00:28:30.130" style="s2">rare herbs on his windowsill that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.420" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">require very precise conditions to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.130" end="00:28:32.410" style="s2">maintained in order to flourish kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:35.080" style="s2">thing you know what I mean that could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.410" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">his hobby and you know his his neat</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.080" end="00:28:38.920" style="s2">contribution to food right I I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:40.420" style="s2">saying for example is there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.920" end="00:28:44.470" style="s2">that he still couldn&#39;t be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.420" end="00:28:48.370" style="s2">some way yeah yes like the um what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.470" end="00:28:51.399" style="s2">word like the consent piece like if they</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.370" end="00:28:53.169" style="s2">want to be if it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.399" end="00:28:56.259" style="s2">absolutely be part of growing because</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.169" end="00:28:58.089" style="s2">that&#39;s an amazing part of the it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.259" end="00:28:59.259" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing piece right to be able</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.089" end="00:29:01.089" style="s2">to have your hands in the dirt and be</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.259" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">able to grow and yet some people really</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.089" end="00:29:04.869" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do that and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:07.960" style="s2">food production is a product like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.869" end="00:29:10.299" style="s2">growing it it&#39;s prepping it it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.960" end="00:29:13.479" style="s2">it to the people whether it&#39;s five feet</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.299" end="00:29:15.129" style="s2">away or whether it&#39;s it&#39;s nerds away its</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.479" end="00:29:17.859" style="s2">its transporting and it&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.129" end="00:29:19.330" style="s2">system because I think there are things</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.859" end="00:29:21.460" style="s2">that can be decentralized and things</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.330" end="00:29:23.409" style="s2">that can&#39;t be decentralized and so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.460" end="00:29:24.940" style="s2">can grow 99 percent of your food within</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.409" end="00:29:26.589" style="s2">your community or ninety percent of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.940" end="00:29:28.269" style="s2">food within your community there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.589" end="00:29:31.479" style="s2">be some things that like don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.269" end="00:29:33.580" style="s2">sense to grow in every different I</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.479" end="00:29:34.869" style="s2">understand these conditions are</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.580" end="00:29:36.429" style="s2">difficult to create and so it only makes</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.869" end="00:29:38.229" style="s2">sense to create them in a few places or</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.429" end="00:29:40.239" style="s2">whatever you know I completely accept</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.229" end="00:29:42.429" style="s2">that I mean at the other end at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.239" end="00:29:44.200" style="s2">other extreme end you know nobody wants</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.429" end="00:29:46.059" style="s2">to grow anything right is we haven&#39;t got</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.200" end="00:29:47.589" style="s2">time for a busy doing other things none</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.059" end="00:29:49.570" style="s2">of us want to grow anything right</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.589" end="00:29:50.679" style="s2">and again fair enough I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.570" end="00:29:51.879" style="s2">that people shouldn&#39;t be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.679" end="00:29:54.580" style="s2">that choice on that but there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.879" end="00:29:56.200" style="s2">already in existence I&#39;ve been for some</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.580" end="00:29:59.619" style="s2">reason this has been popping up a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.200" end="00:30:01.539" style="s2">my notifications is these automated</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.619" end="00:30:04.599" style="s2">vertical farms alright these automated</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.539" end="00:30:06.099" style="s2">hydroponic vertical farms which take us</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.599" end="00:30:07.839" style="s2">very very very different ground room</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.099" end="00:30:09.580" style="s2">used up relatively for the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.839" end="00:30:11.649" style="s2">food they produce very little water very</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.580" end="00:30:13.450" style="s2">little nutrients all conditions be</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.649" end="00:30:14.739" style="s2">optimized things grow really quickly you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.450" end="00:30:16.149" style="s2">can grow them year-round things that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.739" end="00:30:18.489" style="s2">couldn&#39;t otherwise grow in that climate</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.149" end="00:30:20.229" style="s2">blah blah blah blah blah and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.489" end="00:30:22.509" style="s2">it would again it wouldn&#39;t require a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.229" end="00:30:24.849" style="s2">massive amount of investment to install</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.509" end="00:30:26.889" style="s2">these things in urban environments where</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.849" end="00:30:29.049" style="s2">people don&#39;t really have the facility to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.889" end="00:30:30.639" style="s2">grow but they can still have food being</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.049" end="00:30:32.379" style="s2">produced locally and make a contribution</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.639" end="00:30:34.779" style="s2">to the maintenance and production and</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.779" end="00:30:42.429" style="s2">of and preparing of and so on so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.629" end="00:30:43.659" style="s2">III it&#39;s this is kind of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.429" end="00:30:46.059" style="s2">points I was trying to get across in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.659" end="00:30:49.379" style="s2">essay that the idea of sticking to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.059" end="00:30:53.019" style="s2">source is that the source the point is</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.379" end="00:30:56.019" style="s2">as far as is sensible localized and make</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.019" end="00:30:57.820" style="s2">accessible and make anti fragile so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.019" end="00:30:59.229" style="s2">in the event of collapse somewhere it</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.820" end="00:31:01.419" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that the whole world now</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.229" end="00:31:02.429" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have this thing right the you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.419" end="00:31:04.470" style="s2">know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.429" end="00:31:07.169" style="s2">modular ground-up construction so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.470" end="00:31:10.259" style="s2">whatever happens anywhere like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.169" end="00:31:12.299" style="s2">like cells in a beehive if something</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.259" end="00:31:14.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter this is all still intact</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.299" end="00:31:21.299" style="s2">and can rip you know can repair that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.610" end="00:31:23.519" style="s2">yeah that sort of thing yeah like we</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.299" end="00:31:25.230" style="s2">need all of it it&#39;s like we need the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.519" end="00:31:27.059" style="s2">piece that is right like you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.230" end="00:31:28.860" style="s2">autonomous community and you grow 90</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.059" end="00:31:30.299" style="s2">percent of your food but also some</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.860" end="00:31:31.830" style="s2">can go wrong and we don&#39;t want you to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.299" end="00:31:34.409" style="s2">starve so like if you&#39;re connected I</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.830" end="00:31:35.879" style="s2">think global society to be like right we</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.409" end="00:31:39.779" style="s2">got food for you don&#39;t worry like your</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.879" end="00:31:42.389" style="s2">crop fail don&#39;t worry we got everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.779" end="00:31:44.210" style="s2">we&#39;re good right like especially with</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.389" end="00:31:46.919" style="s2">climate change with technology and</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.210" end="00:31:51.179" style="s2">there&#39;s this big to be broken piece of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.919" end="00:31:53.129" style="s2">game a slash capitalism that is like</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.179" end="00:31:54.210" style="s2">just because you have a brilliant idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.129" end="00:31:55.649" style="s2">just because you&#39;ve built a better</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.210" end="00:31:58.230" style="s2">mousetrap just cuz you built the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.649" end="00:32:00.649" style="s2">automated amazing vertical farm doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.230" end="00:32:03.149" style="s2">mean it exists on the market because</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.649" end="00:32:04.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not designed for that it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.149" end="00:32:06.690" style="s2">for the competitors to keep you out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.830" end="00:32:08.220" style="s2">designed for you know what I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.690" end="00:32:11.460" style="s2">you need the entire system to work</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.220" end="00:32:13.409" style="s2">whereas if you break it down to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.460" end="00:32:15.509" style="s2">individual contribution and ask okay if</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.409" end="00:32:17.070" style="s2">you have a brilliant idea how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.509" end="00:32:18.299" style="s2">it to market right like how do we get it</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.070" end="00:32:19.950" style="s2">to the people I don&#39;t care if it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.299" end="00:32:22.019" style="s2">a market but how do we get it to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.950" end="00:32:23.879" style="s2">people if you want your idea to be part</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.019" end="00:32:26.850" style="s2">of the people right like if you want you</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.879" end="00:32:29.220" style="s2">create a new spray nozzle for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.850" end="00:32:31.499" style="s2">automated farm that that helps everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.220" end="00:32:33.179" style="s2">and everyone wants to have access to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.499" end="00:32:35.070" style="s2">that how do you actually how do we</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.179" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">assess it to make sure it&#39;s better how</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.070" end="00:32:39.090" style="s2">do we have diversity so maybe different</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:40.409" style="s2">all that comes out that comes out and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.090" end="00:32:41.879" style="s2">that comes out and the walls really</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.409" end="00:32:43.080" style="s2">quickly if everybody has access to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.879" end="00:32:45.179" style="s2">and they can just download the design</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.080" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">and 3d print it right very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.179" end="00:32:48.690" style="s2">feedback will get onto the internet that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:49.950" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t work you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.690" end="00:32:52.529" style="s2">mean this guy said it was great but</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.950" end="00:32:53.999" style="s2">actually it doesn&#39;t work so this is self</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.529" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">regulation I don&#39;t think anyone needs to</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.999" end="00:33:01.080" style="s2">worry about this regulating it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:02.820" style="s2">exist now so we need to worry about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.080" end="00:33:04.649" style="s2">but we don&#39;t need to worry about it as</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.820" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">far as right that&#39;s the point is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.649" end="00:33:08.820" style="s2">create that system exactly like you said</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.499" style="s2">so that if it&#39;s 3d printed and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.820" end="00:33:12.149" style="s2">way to feed back into the system to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.499" end="00:33:14.340" style="s2">okay well this broke in two weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.149" end="00:33:15.570" style="s2">then you know would have made been I</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.340" end="00:33:17.580" style="s2">made it out of titanium</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.570" end="00:33:19.650" style="s2">instead of you know this instead of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.580" end="00:33:21.990" style="s2">steel and it works even better able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.650" end="00:33:24.210" style="s2">get back in so we can all improve it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.990" end="00:33:26.250" style="s2">right that you that and then again some</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.210" end="00:33:27.870" style="s2">things maybe especially right now many</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.250" end="00:33:29.910" style="s2">things can&#39;t be 3d printed right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.870" end="00:33:31.650" style="s2">at the infancy of 3d printing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.910" end="00:33:34.380" style="s2">very few materials that can be done</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.650" end="00:33:36.890" style="s2">especially with a 3d printer that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.380" end="00:33:40.470" style="s2">just you don&#39;t mean can buy for viral</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.890" end="00:33:43.980" style="s2">but the more we can so instead of having</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.470" end="00:33:45.870" style="s2">it a for-profit manufacturing having it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.980" end="00:33:48.750" style="s2">be okay well how many widgets do we need</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.870" end="00:33:51.030" style="s2">right and how how cheaply / efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.750" end="00:33:52.740" style="s2">can you actually make them and so does</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.030" end="00:33:55.260" style="s2">it make sense to have a widget factory</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.740" end="00:33:57.870" style="s2">in every small town with it&#39;s a 3d</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.260" end="00:34:01.380" style="s2">printer absolutely but not if it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.870" end="00:34:02.940" style="s2">a factory right well tell me what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.380" end="00:34:05.330" style="s2">think of this the rather than investing</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.940" end="00:34:09.090" style="s2">in factories to make widgets that rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.330" end="00:34:10.290" style="s2">the investment is listen we need widgets</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.090" end="00:34:12.180" style="s2">in the mean time so you know a bare</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.290" end="00:34:13.890" style="s2">minimum widget production is maintained</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.180" end="00:34:16.530" style="s2">just to satisfy the immediate need for</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.890" end="00:34:18.810" style="s2">widgets but but actually for the long</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.530" end="00:34:21.090" style="s2">term the investment should be going into</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.810" end="00:34:22.290" style="s2">the refinement of 3d printing such that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.090" end="00:34:24.060" style="s2">people can design and print their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.290" end="00:34:26.850" style="s2">widgets on the site right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.060" end="00:34:29.670" style="s2">about you know redirecting brainpower</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.850" end="00:34:31.650" style="s2">and resources and so on in so the long</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.670" end="00:34:33.450" style="s2">term solution rather than all we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.650" end="00:34:35.250" style="s2">more widgets let&#39;s open let&#39;s make more</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.450" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">factories to make more widgets but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.250" end="00:34:39.570" style="s2">know in the generative long term and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:41.340" style="s2">then of course once you advance three at</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.570" end="00:34:43.530" style="s2">once in fast 3d printing technology to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.340" end="00:34:45.930" style="s2">the point where you can make design and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.530" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">print your own widgets you know bespoke</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.930" end="00:34:50.100" style="s2">widgets to do exactly what you want them</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:52.140" style="s2">to do now you&#39;ve also at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.100" end="00:34:53.880" style="s2">alongside that created the technology</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.140" end="00:34:56.820" style="s2">for people to make things other than</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.880" end="00:35:00.510" style="s2">widgets bespoke and share them and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.820" end="00:35:05.250" style="s2">you see what I mean and so this thing so</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.510" end="00:35:10.460" style="s2">yeah I the wisdom to intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.250" end="00:35:12.990" style="s2">target resources for the real long term</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.460" end="00:35:14.940" style="s2">good I think that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.990" end="00:35:17.790" style="s2">that&#39;s a big feature of staying</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.940" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">connected to source right I the game a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.790" end="00:35:21.030" style="s2">wants you to right now make more widgets</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:22.380" style="s2">cuz there&#39;s demand for widgets I can</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.030" end="00:35:26.730" style="s2">sell lots of widgets so let&#39;s make more</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.380" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">widgets whereas and that&#39;s alright I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.730" end="00:35:31.860" style="s2">made my point I&#39;m gonna repeat myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:33.570" style="s2">it&#39;s already the solution to like</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.860" end="00:35:35.160" style="s2">print-on-demand right like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.570" end="00:35:36.690" style="s2">need to you don&#39;t need to create a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.160" end="00:35:38.190" style="s2">million widgets and then make sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.690" end="00:35:39.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a market for a million widgets</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.190" end="00:35:41.310" style="s2">and how do you profit off of a billion</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.600" end="00:35:43.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like do we need a widget printer</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.310" end="00:35:45.390" style="s2">widget but until the technology&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.410" end="00:35:47.550" style="s2">we need to figure out how many widgets</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.390" end="00:35:49.170" style="s2">we need in society and then create them</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:52.710" style="s2">in a factory type setting so we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.170" end="00:35:56.220" style="s2">them and then like and then at the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.710" end="00:35:59.160" style="s2">time empower people to be working on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.220" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">engineering piece of like one we need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.160" end="00:36:02.250" style="s2">be able to 3d print widgets I may need</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:05.010" style="s2">to be able to do that in multiple and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.250" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">multiple materials and allow anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.010" end="00:36:07.710" style="s2">wants to work in that space to work in</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:09.060" style="s2">that space right you don&#39;t need to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.710" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">an engineering degree to figure those</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.060" end="00:36:13.350" style="s2">things so you need to have a makerspace</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.210" style="s2">you need to have people to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.350" end="00:36:16.680" style="s2">like you know what I mean if you had ten</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.210" end="00:36:18.210" style="s2">thousand people around the world working</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.680" end="00:36:19.380" style="s2">on that especially if you have the tools</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.210" end="00:36:22.500" style="s2">to be able to communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.380" end="00:36:24.540" style="s2">other to stay where you are then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.500" end="00:36:25.800" style="s2">not necessarily your full-time job it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.540" end="00:36:29.120" style="s2">because no one I&#39;m hoping has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.800" end="00:36:31.800" style="s2">full-time job they don&#39;t want one that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.120" end="00:36:33.570" style="s2">you&#39;re playing right like you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.800" end="00:36:35.250" style="s2">this is what you&#39;re it you&#39;re in sweet</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.570" end="00:36:36.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a game it&#39;s funny so you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.250" end="00:36:37.230" style="s2">to figure out a puzzle exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.510" end="00:36:39.690" style="s2">that&#39;s the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.230" end="00:36:41.220" style="s2">exactly exactly that and as you say ten</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.690" end="00:36:43.560" style="s2">thousand enthusiasts for this thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.220" end="00:36:45.300" style="s2">around the world all I&#39;ve just had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.560" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">great idea what do you think of this and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.300" end="00:36:48.330" style="s2">boom it goes out to the whole network</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:49.740" style="s2">all at once right and everyone takes a</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.330" end="00:36:51.990" style="s2">look at it you know you&#39;re really on to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.740" end="00:36:54.470" style="s2">something here and and so on and so on</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.990" end="00:36:59.400" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s actually frightening</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.470" end="00:37:01.950" style="s2">to think of the pace at which innovation</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.400" end="00:37:03.810" style="s2">and technology would take place in such</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.950" end="00:37:05.370" style="s2">circumstances I mean it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.810" end="00:37:06.810" style="s2">terrifying what people would start</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.370" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">coming up with in a very short space of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.810" end="00:37:10.920" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:13.230" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s like you&#39;re an optimist</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.920" end="00:37:16.230" style="s2">because you think of capitalism in 10</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.230" end="00:37:16.770" style="s2">years I&#39;ve been doing this for three</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.230" end="00:37:20.520" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.770" end="00:37:22.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s such a slow pace it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.520" end="00:37:25.410" style="s2">freaking snowball rolling down the hill</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.440" end="00:37:28.080" style="s2">yeah handful of technology like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.410" end="00:37:30.090" style="s2">handful like a way to find a group of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.080" end="00:37:32.280" style="s2">people a way to have like a global</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.090" end="00:37:34.500" style="s2">conversation a way that like a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.280" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">handful of tools this thing explodes</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.500" end="00:37:39.870" style="s2">because when you tap into human</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:43.400" style="s2">ingenuity and let people tap into their</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.870" end="00:37:43.400" style="s2">flow they don&#39;t need to do it full-time</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.960" end="00:37:50.170" style="s2">a little bit here and there is plenty</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.720" end="00:37:52.090" style="s2">absolutely you give them the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.170" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">instead of going on Facebook and Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.090" end="00:37:56.110" style="s2">and getting this like gross feeling they</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">instead get to connect with people they</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.110" end="00:38:01.000" style="s2">actually like and solve problems they</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:03.040" style="s2">actually want to work on they knew that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.000" end="00:38:04.930" style="s2">that&#39;s why Wikipedia exists that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.040" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">all of these things exists and when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.930" end="00:38:08.920" style="s2">tap into that in every different sector</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:11.110" style="s2">and I&#39;m not assigning you engineering</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.920" end="00:38:14.110" style="s2">I&#39;m letting you be an engineer I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.110" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">care what you&#39;re working on basically is</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.110" end="00:38:20.350" style="s2">a way to happen is that you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:22.450" style="s2">on the technology cooperative yes that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.350" end="00:38:24.790" style="s2">we challenge your own individual nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.450" end="00:38:28.630" style="s2">right now what&#39;s the idea cafe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.790" end="00:38:30.460" style="s2">our first project it&#39;s a YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.630" end="00:38:32.140" style="s2">which is what you&#39;ll be participating in</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.460" end="00:38:35.020" style="s2">well later today for me probably it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.140" end="00:38:37.750" style="s2">more over you know it&#39;s late you should</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.020" end="00:38:43.240" style="s2">not but that&#39;s okay anyway so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.750" end="00:38:44.500" style="s2">fine and creating the tools and so right</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.240" end="00:38:46.120" style="s2">now we&#39;re creating the communication</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.500" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">tool which is the idea cafe to be able</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.120" end="00:38:48.790" style="s2">to have a conversation with a large</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:52.380" style="s2">group of people that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.790" end="00:38:55.120" style="s2">engineering conversation that&#39;s a um</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.380" end="00:38:56.470" style="s2">what do we need right like what what is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.120" end="00:38:57.670" style="s2">it would you do in your life I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.470" end="00:38:59.380" style="s2">know like like being able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.670" end="00:39:00.970" style="s2">conversation with hundreds or thousands</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.380" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">or millions of people so that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.970" end="00:39:07.870" style="s2">contributed and it still ends up leaving</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:11.530" style="s2">somewhere bio them I can&#39;t I can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.870" end="00:39:13.630" style="s2">my head around you actually engineer</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.530" end="00:39:15.850" style="s2">that what the architecture would be that</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.630" end="00:39:19.600" style="s2">allows that to happen we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.850" end="00:39:21.580" style="s2">everyone has is becomes aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.600" end="00:39:25.210" style="s2">which has gone on everywhere else I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.580" end="00:39:26.620" style="s2">that&#39;s this yeah how does that happen I</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:31.420" style="s2">don&#39;t see any way to make that happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.620" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">how does it happen well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.420" end="00:39:35.650" style="s2">concept called the World Cafe that they</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:37.300" style="s2">have for like hundreds or thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.650" end="00:39:39.670" style="s2">people it&#39;s not generally for millions</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.300" end="00:39:41.890" style="s2">of people but in its real space in real</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.670" end="00:39:43.690" style="s2">time you have like a days as set aside</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.890" end="00:39:45.610" style="s2">for it and you have people show up and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.690" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">they have cons so you have a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.610" end="00:39:49.720" style="s2">people and there&#39;s room there&#39;s no I</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:50.890" style="s2">heard you talk to Jordan about I heard</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.720" end="00:39:52.600" style="s2">you I heard your conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.890" end="00:39:54.619" style="s2">Jordan you talked about this yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.600" end="00:39:55.999" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.619" end="00:39:59.539" style="s2">again for anyone that&#39;s listening to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.999" end="00:40:01.910" style="s2">this go ahead oh yeah I guess okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.539" end="00:40:03.740" style="s2">just so they mean in tables of four and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.910" end="00:40:05.539" style="s2">then you switch tables so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.740" end="00:40:07.160" style="s2">effective bigger conversation happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.539" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s your individual conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.160" end="00:40:10.309" style="s2">happening to be able to do that on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:11.630" style="s2">grand scale so instead of going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.309" end="00:40:13.160" style="s2">Twitter and yelling at each other you</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.630" end="00:40:15.950" style="s2">can come on and discuss the question of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.160" end="00:40:17.450" style="s2">the day right when we first have it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.950" end="00:40:19.579" style="s2">they&#39;ll maybe one question the day as</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.450" end="00:40:21.529" style="s2">the threshold of people grows there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.579" end="00:40:23.299" style="s2">gonna be individual niches so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.529" end="00:40:25.730" style="s2">you&#39;re the food piece right like how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.299" end="00:40:28.309" style="s2">you which which can take any number</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.730" end="00:40:30.680" style="s2">you&#39;re creating questions that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.309" end="00:40:33.170" style="s2">create division that instead create how</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.680" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">do you have a conversation and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.170" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">voting on those questions what are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:37.759" style="s2">most empowering you&#39;re learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:39.410" style="s2">how to have the most empowering</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.759" end="00:40:41.390" style="s2">questions that don&#39;t lead to debate and</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.410" end="00:40:43.130" style="s2">instead lead to generative ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.390" end="00:40:44.869" style="s2">we&#39;re learning how to create the tools</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.130" end="00:40:47.210" style="s2">to actually have those generative ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.869" end="00:40:50.029" style="s2">means something in the actual world cafe</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.210" end="00:40:52.490" style="s2">you&#39;re writing you&#39;re like taking notes</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.029" end="00:40:55.069" style="s2">on the coffee table like on a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.490" end="00:40:58.369" style="s2">paper that is that what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.069" end="00:41:00.289" style="s2">tablecloth and and then you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.369" end="00:41:02.660" style="s2">together at the end and harvesting that</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.289" end="00:41:04.279" style="s2">conversation as long as we own that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.660" end="00:41:06.109" style="s2">we&#39;re never getting it right like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.279" end="00:41:08.329" style="s2">never getting it perfect how do we keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.109" end="00:41:10.430" style="s2">improving that right how do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.329" end="00:41:13.430" style="s2">tape of virtual tablecloth how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.430" end="00:41:14.630" style="s2">harvest yesterday&#39;s conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.430" end="00:41:17.150" style="s2">next day and I think it&#39;s by having</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.630" end="00:41:20.869" style="s2">another like literally just a question</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.150" end="00:41:22.910" style="s2">around like with if a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.869" end="00:41:24.349" style="s2">have a conversation maybe if we&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.910" end="00:41:27.470" style="s2">a hundred people want to harvest it</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.349" end="00:41:28.940" style="s2">right so that is but those hundred</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.470" end="00:41:30.499" style="s2">people kind of represent the thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.940" end="00:41:32.450" style="s2">because they were happy tunes with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.499" end="00:41:34.279" style="s2">thousand and if you had the better ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.450" end="00:41:36.499" style="s2">if it really generated something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.279" end="00:41:39.170" style="s2">going to get more one harvest it so by</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.499" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">making a system so that um there&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.170" end="00:41:41.630" style="s2">thousand people having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:43.609" style="s2">the next day there&#39;s a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.630" end="00:41:44.839" style="s2">harvesting it and some of those thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.609" end="00:41:46.339" style="s2">are also participating in that day&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.839" end="00:41:48.259" style="s2">conversation and some won&#39;t you let it</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.339" end="00:41:49.460" style="s2">go right you kind of have to let go that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.259" end="00:41:52.549" style="s2">you can&#39;t solve everything</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.730" end="00:42:14.470" style="s2">just by doing that I think we focus</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.190" end="00:42:15.880" style="s2">because then there&#39;s gonna be tools that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.470" end="00:42:17.500" style="s2">were like right there&#39;s tools that</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.880" end="00:42:19.890" style="s2">already exist right how to how to find</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.210" end="00:42:26.470" style="s2">money they all cost a ridiculous amount</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:28.300" style="s2">of money if you have 500 people working</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.470" end="00:42:29.849" style="s2">on a project and there it&#39;s each $10 per</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.849" end="00:42:35.650" style="s2">that&#39;s funny we can create our own tool</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.260" end="00:42:37.180" style="s2">with write that and so as we look for</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.650" end="00:42:38.349" style="s2">ways to be like okay what would help</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.180" end="00:42:40.390" style="s2">with this right what can we use that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.349" end="00:42:43.060" style="s2">already exists that&#39;s cool that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.390" end="00:42:44.290" style="s2">Facebook well we recreate those things</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.060" end="00:42:46.510" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want Google and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.290" end="00:42:48.250" style="s2">Facebook to own them but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.510" end="00:42:50.050" style="s2">point in reinventing the wheel before we</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.250" end="00:42:51.700" style="s2">need to so let&#39;s concentrate on how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.050" end="00:42:54.339" style="s2">we create I do get cafe how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.700" end="00:42:55.810" style="s2">the things that don&#39;t exist yet and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.339" end="00:42:57.069" style="s2">create the ones that do and then once</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.810" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">you get to that point where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.069" end="00:43:02.290" style="s2">handful of tools including tools to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:03.849" style="s2">able to say this doesn&#39;t make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.290" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">me this isn&#39;t working for me this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.849" end="00:43:07.480" style="s2">right to be able to constantly improve</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:08.950" style="s2">it like we&#39;re using to the best of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.480" end="00:43:11.050" style="s2">capability and looking for ways to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.950" end="00:43:12.730" style="s2">improve it and then once we get to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.050" end="00:43:14.650" style="s2">certain point that the tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.730" end="00:43:16.420" style="s2">happens and like everyone wants to come</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.650" end="00:43:18.250" style="s2">on board and everybody wants to play and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.420" end="00:43:19.930" style="s2">everybody or maybe not but we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.250" end="00:43:22.180" style="s2">everyone right we need a tiny fraction</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.930" end="00:43:24.369" style="s2">of humanity concentrating on solving</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.180" end="00:43:26.740" style="s2">humanity&#39;s problems and I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.369" end="00:43:27.970" style="s2">ready for it we want it we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.740" end="00:43:30.460" style="s2">have the tools yet we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.970" end="00:43:32.109" style="s2">exists yeah I mean I think at a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.460" end="00:43:33.910" style="s2">level I think that&#39;s true you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.109" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">everybody on board figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.910" end="00:43:40.270" style="s2">have to make better systems but I was I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:43.060" style="s2">there was a threads a little while ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.270" end="00:43:45.069" style="s2">the way that and talking about what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.060" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">actually see is the problems being and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.069" end="00:43:49.660" style="s2">so you know if you see problems as being</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:51.700" style="s2">poverty inequality climate change</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.660" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">whatever you know those are very very</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.700" end="00:43:57.160" style="s2">very very long list of these things</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:44:00.730" style="s2">right then yeah you need new systems to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.160" end="00:44:03.400" style="s2">manage resource distribution and energy</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.730" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">production and bla bla bla bla bla in in</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.400" end="00:44:09.430" style="s2">in more effective ways but for me</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:13.410" style="s2">personally these are not problems these</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.430" end="00:44:15.660" style="s2">are symptoms of a far far far deep</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.410" end="00:44:20.690" style="s2">hard to put your finger on malaise you</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.660" end="00:44:23.100" style="s2">know which is a sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.690" end="00:44:25.170" style="s2">disconnection from meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.100" end="00:44:27.540" style="s2">relationship and a sense of purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.170" end="00:44:31.530" style="s2">a sense of place which comes from living</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.940" end="00:44:50.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very very difficult to feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.110" end="00:44:54.690" style="s2">important or significant in any way</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.760" end="00:44:56.340" style="s2">right whereas if you&#39;re a cog in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.690" end="00:44:58.110" style="s2">tiny machine which is just a single</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.340" end="00:45:00.390" style="s2">community you can see exactly what every</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.390" end="00:45:03.870" style="s2">very very clearly that if your card</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.520" end="00:45:05.370" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there this thing wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.870" end="00:45:07.130" style="s2">function at least not as well as it does</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.370" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">with you there right and so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.130" end="00:45:14.460" style="s2">immediate excuse me a place and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:17.250" style="s2">that that to me all the the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.460" end="00:45:20.040" style="s2">that I should say that immediately is</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.250" end="00:45:24.500" style="s2">the real problem right and and that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.040" end="00:45:29.460" style="s2">why people turn to crime and to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.500" end="00:45:33.270" style="s2">addiction and to permit ISM and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.460" end="00:45:35.490" style="s2">why this and so on and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.270" end="00:45:38.670" style="s2">problems in the world are actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.490" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">symptoms of that that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.670" end="00:45:42.540" style="s2">which is you know blacks where we</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:45.510" style="s2">started this conversation I think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.540" end="00:45:47.930" style="s2">idea of small groups forming</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.510" end="00:45:50.370" style="s2">relationships with each other but that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.930" end="00:45:52.170" style="s2">you know thatthat small group thing is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.370" end="00:45:53.370" style="s2">there&#39;s like the inviolable unit if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.170" end="00:45:56.370" style="s2">like again I don&#39;t like the word</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.370" end="00:45:59.580" style="s2">inviolable but you know what I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.370" end="00:46:01.020" style="s2">that that to me actually is where the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.580" end="00:46:05.880" style="s2">solution to the problems come from but</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.020" end="00:46:09.810" style="s2">this in turn requires a complete value</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.880" end="00:46:13.020" style="s2">system adjustment right internally in in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.810" end="00:46:14.900" style="s2">in in many many many people to ratchet</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.020" end="00:46:18.270" style="s2">down to hang on what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.900" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">important is building developing</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.270" end="00:46:22.500" style="s2">maintaining meaningful relationships</p>
