<p begin="00:00:00.920" end="00:00:07.109" style="s2">hi my name is Joe Brewer and I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.110" end="00:00:08.940" style="s2">innovation strategist I didn&#39;t just come</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.109" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">to this work in a direct path like I</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.940" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t go to college and sign up for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">BS and innovation no I took a different</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">approach and since the work that idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">was a bit unusual a bit unorthodox I</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:22.830" style="s2">thought you might appreciate learning</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">how I came to do this work see it</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.830" end="00:00:26.070" style="s2">started out when I was an undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">student Southeast Missouri State</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.070" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">University in Cape Girardeau and I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:32.309" style="s2">interested in a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:34.170" style="s2">so I started studying physics and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.309" end="00:00:36.600" style="s2">philosophy and I was very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.170" end="00:00:39.930" style="s2">the Performing Arts so I studied dance</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.600" end="00:00:41.460" style="s2">and theatre as well and pretty soon I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.930" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">realized that when I was very interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.460" end="00:00:46.350" style="s2">actually was the foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">knowledge and in explaining the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.350" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">patterns that unfold around us in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:52.500" style="s2">world so I started digging into it an</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">area of research called complexity</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">science and I learned that there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">ways to rigorously analyze dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">systems to explain the patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">unfolding within them as well as to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">the limitations of our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">understand or predict what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">in a complex world I started out doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">this as a philosopher and then as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:16.200" style="s2">physicist and I studied it in physics</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">specifically because that&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.200" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">where you can construct controllable</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:23.100" style="s2">experiments and really in a quantifiable</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:25.890" style="s2">way figure out what&#39;s going on in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.100" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">system and why paves the way it does now</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">I didn&#39;t study this to just be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:31.860" style="s2">physicist I studied it because I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">to understand how those same patterns</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.860" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">could unfold in complex social systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">so when I went to graduate school in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">atmospheric science at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">Illinois I focused on how complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">patterns form not specifically i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">looking at how cloud structures form and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">how the structure of clouds can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">characterized in climate models to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">better predict how energy moves through</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">the atmosphere but all the way as I went</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.770" style="s2">along I was learning a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">about the global climate system about</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.770" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">human civilization and about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">patterns that dominate our world so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:12.629" style="s2">quickly realized that having another</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">physicist studying climate wasn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.629" end="00:02:15.190" style="s2">to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">global problems that really the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.190" end="00:02:19.480" style="s2">challenges are in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:21.879" style="s2">large-scale behavior the dominant norms</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.480" end="00:02:23.980" style="s2">and values of society and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.879" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">institutional structures that drive so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.980" end="00:02:28.750" style="s2">much of how we behave on a large scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:31.569" style="s2">so I left the university and left my</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.750" end="00:02:33.909" style="s2">background in the formal physical</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.569" end="00:02:36.129" style="s2">sciences and went into a different area</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.909" end="00:02:38.140" style="s2">I started studying the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.129" end="00:02:39.879" style="s2">behavioral sciences because I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.140" end="00:02:41.860" style="s2">understand how human behavior works and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.879" end="00:02:43.810" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t just interested in this as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.860" end="00:02:45.609" style="s2">academic I was interested in solving</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.810" end="00:02:49.299" style="s2">real-world problems like climate change</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.609" end="00:02:51.549" style="s2">or global poverty or more close to home</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.299" end="00:02:53.829" style="s2">here in the US now broken political</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.549" end="00:02:56.709" style="s2">system massive manipulation through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.829" end="00:02:58.359" style="s2">media and a set of corrupting influences</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.709" end="00:03:01.739" style="s2">that make democracy rather difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.359" end="00:03:04.299" style="s2">have so as I was learning about</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.739" end="00:03:07.379" style="s2">cognitive science studying things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.299" end="00:03:11.260" style="s2">neuroscience and linguistics sociology</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.379" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">that I was applying my earlier training</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.260" end="00:03:14.590" style="s2">in complex systems to look at the trends</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:17.530" style="s2">and patterns that shape human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.590" end="00:03:19.329" style="s2">and as I started really taking in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.530" end="00:03:21.609" style="s2">learning these things in a realm of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.329" end="00:03:24.910" style="s2">practitioner which means I was working</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.609" end="00:03:26.829" style="s2">with executives and nonprofits and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.910" end="00:03:30.040" style="s2">government agencies as well as people</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.829" end="00:03:31.090" style="s2">running social businesses and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.040" end="00:03:35.019" style="s2">looking at how the change process</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:36.669" style="s2">unfolds how does my person&#39;s behavior in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.019" end="00:03:38.230" style="s2">one setting change as they move to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.669" end="00:03:40.269" style="s2">another setting and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.230" end="00:03:42.459" style="s2">influences that shape this such as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.269" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">cultural narratives that define what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.459" end="00:03:45.699" style="s2">means to be a good person or a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:47.980" style="s2">successful person or what are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.699" end="00:03:50.500" style="s2">priorities that are given greater</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.980" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">salience in a society which you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.500" end="00:03:55.510" style="s2">think of as the dominant values so then</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:03:57.910" style="s2">the US for example we have a priority</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.510" end="00:03:59.739" style="s2">given to individuals so we tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.910" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">a set of individualist values in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.739" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">culture so how would that shape human</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:06.129" style="s2">behavior and I would have shaped the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:08.470" style="s2">adoption of changes that could promote</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.129" end="00:04:10.840" style="s2">greater sustainability greater social</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.470" end="00:04:13.959" style="s2">justice and greater while sharing of</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.959" end="00:04:17.079" style="s2">this work over the last several years</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.430" end="00:04:19.599" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned quite a few things about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.079" end="00:04:20.859" style="s2">how the change process works and I hope</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.599" end="00:04:23.200" style="s2">this brief introduction gives you a</p>
