<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">around the age of three or so my father</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.320" end="00:03:14.850" style="s2">was a b-17 bomber pilot with the US Air</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">Corps Army Air Corps at the time before</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.850" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">the airforce and he was in the position</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.120" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">of bombing Germany from a base in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">England on these near the end of the war</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:27.260" style="s2">very big bombing raids where they&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">700 planes</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.260" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">1,200 planes maybe even more in a single</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:36.360" style="s2">mission and so they would all take off</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">before dawn go across the English</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.360" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">Channel and bomb Germany on the day in</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">question my father was the very first</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">guy in this mission all of the planes</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:51.660" style="s2">were following him and there were about</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:53.640" style="s2">700 that particular day and so as he</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.660" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">approached the targets which were just</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.640" end="00:04:00.390" style="s2">outside of d√ºsseldorf they were railroad</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:04.440" style="s2">marshalling yards his left wing was</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.390" end="00:04:06.630" style="s2">taken off by gunfire flak fire an 88</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.440" end="00:04:09.480" style="s2">millimeter cannon was fired by a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.630" end="00:04:12.540" style="s2">fourteen-year-old boy and shot his left</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.480" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">wing off the plane rolled over of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.540" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">on its back and began spinning because</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:18.450" style="s2">one wing was still flying and a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:21.390" style="s2">of the engines were still running and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.450" end="00:04:23.820" style="s2">the centrifugal forces of this spinning</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.390" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">plane were so great that it pulled the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.820" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">plane to pieces and the piece my father</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:28.740" style="s2">was in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:31.889" style="s2">was of course the cockpit because he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.740" end="00:04:34.830" style="s2">the commander I mean the pilot in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.889" end="00:04:37.740" style="s2">command and the man next to him was his</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.830" end="00:04:39.750" style="s2">commander Colonel hunter what&#39;s his name</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.740" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">colonel frank hunter and he was already</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.750" end="00:04:44.040" style="s2">dead my father said when he looked over</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">my father looked over and said I guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.040" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">this is it famous last words</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:53.430" style="s2">now at that time that that he was shot</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:56.040" style="s2">down which was January 23rd 1945 he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.430" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">23 years old and he was considered a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.040" end="00:05:00.120" style="s2">salty old pilot at that time and these</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:02.100" style="s2">guys were supposed to wear their</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.120" end="00:05:05.130" style="s2">parachutes all the time throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.100" end="00:05:07.200" style="s2">entire ten-hour mission sometimes longer</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.130" end="00:05:08.280" style="s2">mission and they didn&#39;t they stuck him</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.200" end="00:05:10.200" style="s2">under their seats because they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.280" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">uncomfortable so my father didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.200" end="00:05:14.490" style="s2">his parachute on now the cockpit is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">detached from the aircraft it&#39;s falling</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.490" end="00:05:19.740" style="s2">from 27,000 feet which was their</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.370" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">altitude for cruising into this&#39;ll Dorf</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.740" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">area and my father&#39;s trying to get his</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:26.610" style="s2">parachute and of course the centrifugal</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.479" end="00:05:29.010" style="s2">force is so great that as soon as he</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.610" end="00:05:31.200" style="s2">snaps open his seatbelt he&#39;s thrown</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.010" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">against the instrument panel and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:34.590" style="s2">those days their oxygen came through a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:35.370" style="s2">tube that went up the chest to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.590" end="00:05:37.470" style="s2">facemask</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.370" end="00:05:41.220" style="s2">and so it cut off his oxygen at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.470" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">point and he passed out somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.220" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">midair he woke up on the ground inside</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">this chunk of the cockpit and he was</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:56.850" style="s2">alive which amazed him he told me when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:05:59.910" style="s2">was a little older and a German guy they</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.850" end="00:06:02.190" style="s2">were in farmed farm fields by a railroad</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.910" end="00:06:05.010" style="s2">embankment a German guy came up on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.190" end="00:06:06.780" style="s2">stub of the wing that was still there or</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.010" end="00:06:09.060" style="s2">the stub of metal that was on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.780" end="00:06:11.400" style="s2">outside pulled out a pistol and put it</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.060" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">to my father&#39;s head and pulled the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.400" end="00:06:17.370" style="s2">trigger and when he pulled the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">it didn&#39;t fire and at that moment a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.370" end="00:06:21.270" style="s2">german officer came rushing up and said</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t kill this guy he&#39;s an officer</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.270" end="00:06:24.570" style="s2">and he&#39;s a prisoner of war and we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.490" style="s2">to interrogate him and they had this</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.570" end="00:06:27.930" style="s2">argument but you know he&#39;s gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.490" end="00:06:29.850" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna at arrogate him I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.930" end="00:06:32.490" style="s2">gonna shoot him and the Germans stopped</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.850" end="00:06:35.460" style="s2">stopped this guy from killing my father</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.460" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">feet and survived is kind of the message</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.650" end="00:06:40.529" style="s2">that I tell at the beginning of deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.929" style="s2">survival and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.529" end="00:06:44.759" style="s2">it&#39;s a cliffhanger so you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.929" end="00:06:46.259" style="s2">really get the end of the story until</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.759" end="00:06:48.599" style="s2">the end of the book which is the way I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.259" end="00:06:50.519" style="s2">designed it but the end of the story</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.599" end="00:06:53.129" style="s2">obviously is I&#39;m here so he must have</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.519" end="00:06:54.689" style="s2">lived through it it was a hell of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.129" end="00:06:56.189" style="s2">introduction I still remember when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.689" end="00:06:59.789" style="s2">read the book the first time it was like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.189" end="00:07:02.279" style="s2">holy I can&#39;t believe this is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.789" end="00:07:04.259" style="s2">amazing way to start the book AAB well</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.279" end="00:07:06.119" style="s2">and I start the book off by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.259" end="00:07:08.219" style="s2">it&#39;s a little kid you know most kids get</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.119" end="00:07:09.869" style="s2">told these stories and as they grow up</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.219" end="00:07:12.209" style="s2">they realize you know there&#39;s your fairy</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.869" end="00:07:13.829" style="s2">tales I was told this amazing fairy tale</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.209" end="00:07:16.169" style="s2">and as I grew up I realized hey wait a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.829" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">minute that&#39;s true it&#39;s really true and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.169" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">and this really started my interest in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:24.359" style="s2">survival because I thought wow I came</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:27.389" style="s2">very close to not existing you know if</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.359" end="00:07:30.029" style="s2">that fall had killed him or if the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.389" end="00:07:32.009" style="s2">German farmer whoever he was killed him</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.029" end="00:07:34.679" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t be here and that was always</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.009" end="00:07:37.799" style="s2">kind of an existential thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.679" end="00:07:40.049" style="s2">contemplated as I went about my work and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.799" end="00:07:41.939" style="s2">you did a lot of work on the edge right</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.049" end="00:07:43.949" style="s2">yeah in the introduction you talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.939" end="00:07:46.229" style="s2">about working with the Chicago Fire</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.949" end="00:07:48.179" style="s2">Department yeah yeah what were they like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.229" end="00:07:49.979" style="s2">what words acog Oh fireman what were</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.179" end="00:07:53.009" style="s2">they like so this would have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.979" end="00:07:56.339" style="s2">probably I&#39;m guessing like late 80s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.009" end="00:07:58.860" style="s2">Early 90s no it would have been mid 80s</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.339" end="00:08:00.509" style="s2">I guess and I was on an assignment I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.860" end="00:08:02.819" style="s2">been given a series of assignments that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.509" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">was essentially like dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.819" end="00:08:07.499" style="s2">professions so I looked up some</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:10.109" style="s2">statistics and sure enough firefighters</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.499" end="00:08:12.689" style="s2">are right up there and so I proceeded to</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.109" end="00:08:14.999" style="s2">immerse myself in these professions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.689" end="00:08:17.969" style="s2">when I got with the firefighters they</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.999" end="00:08:22.289" style="s2">were wonderful guys I was put into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.969" end="00:08:24.389" style="s2">little firehouse in Chicago west of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.289" end="00:08:26.549" style="s2">loop and you could see the big buildings</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.389" end="00:08:29.819" style="s2">downtown from from here it was on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.549" end="00:08:31.859" style="s2">Salle in the street anyway it was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.819" end="00:08:35.759" style="s2">these guys were just wonderful wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.859" end="00:08:38.669" style="s2">friendly funny you know they they live</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.759" end="00:08:41.099" style="s2">in a firehouse here 24 hours on 48 hours</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.669" end="00:08:42.569" style="s2">off and you stay in the firehouse you</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.099" end="00:08:44.309" style="s2">make all your meals there you sleep</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.569" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">there and you get to know these people</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.309" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">really well and and they took me in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:52.740" style="s2">was it was very heartwarming and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:54.120" style="s2">you know mostly nothing happens and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.740" end="00:08:56.040" style="s2">you&#39;re hanging around and hanging or</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.120" end="00:08:58.020" style="s2">and they get a call and you go out and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.040" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like a homeless guy fell down in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.020" end="00:09:01.170" style="s2">the gutter and they pick him up and take</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:05.670" style="s2">him to the hospital you know it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.170" end="00:09:08.220" style="s2">kind of nothing and then one day</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.670" end="00:09:09.750" style="s2">something really happens and they took</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:11.610" style="s2">me with them I had gotten to know them</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.750" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">pretty well by then so they actually</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.120" end="00:09:29.190" style="s2">on the end and they took me into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:31.950" style="s2">burning house to help them put the fire</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.190" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2">out which I did and it&#39;s terrifying</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.060" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">confiscated it so we had it for plain</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:17.490" style="s2">handed me a sledgehammer and he said</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.990" end="00:13:21.030" style="s2">just don&#39;t say anything they&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.490" end="00:13:23.970" style="s2">assume you&#39;re a cop so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.030" end="00:13:27.150" style="s2">went in to bust this big drug kingpin in</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.550" end="00:13:45.870" style="s2">services over there to take the kids but</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.560" end="00:13:47.490" style="s2">it was pretty exciting before we</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.870" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">actually got in there thinking we were</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.490" end="00:13:52.620" style="s2">blasting our way in yeah that&#39;s it you</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:09.300" style="s2">know being a pilot is that way too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.570" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">described as hours of boredom punctuated</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.300" end="00:14:13.500" style="s2">by seconds of terror yeah I did some</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:15.690" style="s2">flying did all the flying to get my</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.500" end="00:14:17.100" style="s2">private pilot&#39;s license but never got it</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.690" end="00:14:19.080" style="s2">because I got pulled off on a business</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.100" end="00:14:20.970" style="s2">project actually a political project</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.080" end="00:14:22.380" style="s2">after I&#39;d done all the parts that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.970" end="00:14:24.930" style="s2">had to do to get your license I never</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.380" end="00:14:26.940" style="s2">did go for the exam god damn it it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.930" end="00:14:28.140" style="s2">quite an interesting experience yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.940" end="00:14:29.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever go back and do</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.140" end="00:14:31.860" style="s2">it you became a pilot in fact quite a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.790" end="00:14:33.810" style="s2">serious pilot not just a Cessna driver</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.860" end="00:14:35.640" style="s2">but you know you did helicopters and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.810" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">aerobatic and jets and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.640" end="00:14:40.440" style="s2">stuff I imagine kind of driven by your</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:42.510" style="s2">father&#39;s history I would think so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.440" end="00:14:45.540" style="s2">because I grew up thinking that being a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.510" end="00:14:48.630" style="s2">pilot was the ultimate and I have been a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:51.660" style="s2">pilot most of my life I am a instrument</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.630" end="00:14:54.030" style="s2">commercial pilot I flew aerobatic for</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.660" end="00:14:56.520" style="s2">about eight years in high-performance</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.030" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">aircraft I&#39;ve flown a whole variety of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.520" end="00:15:02.960" style="s2">fighter planes and other kinds of jets</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.130" end="00:15:05.400" style="s2">helicopters you know you name it and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.960" end="00:15:08.610" style="s2">actually had the chance to get a ride</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.400" end="00:15:10.440" style="s2">onto and off of an aircraft carrier so</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.610" end="00:15:14.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve had had a lot of exposure in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.440" end="00:15:16.020" style="s2">world and in fact as a journalist when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.040" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">started out one of the first things I</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.020" end="00:15:20.910" style="s2">began doing was investigating airline</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:25.260" style="s2">crashes and writing about them so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.910" end="00:15:27.930" style="s2">was in 1972 or three when I began</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.260" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing now let&#39;s get into some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.930" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">the deep content of the book kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:34.590" style="s2">what is the nature of deep survival one</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:35.760" style="s2">of the themes that came through I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.590" end="00:15:37.350" style="s2">know how many times just mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.760" end="00:15:38.820" style="s2">book I should actually do a search on in</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.350" end="00:15:40.190" style="s2">fact I&#39;m gonna do a search on it live</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.820" end="00:15:44.640" style="s2">what the hell I make an idiot of myself</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.190" end="00:15:46.890" style="s2">the word cool the word cool appears 52</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.640" end="00:15:49.230" style="s2">times in the book the first pull quote I</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.890" end="00:15:52.110" style="s2">pulled out to prepare my notes is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.230" end="00:15:52.980" style="s2">first lesson is to remain calm not to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.110" end="00:15:54.900" style="s2">panic</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.980" end="00:15:58.380" style="s2">because emotions are called hot</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.900" end="00:16:00.960" style="s2">cognition this is known as being cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.380" end="00:16:03.540" style="s2">and you riff on the idea of cool and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.960" end="00:16:05.580" style="s2">coolness and being cool and pretending</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.540" end="00:16:08.640" style="s2">to be cool rock tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.580" end="00:16:11.850" style="s2">about that it&#39;s really an important</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.640" end="00:16:14.990" style="s2">thing and one that I can&#39;t emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.850" end="00:16:18.860" style="s2">enough especially today what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.990" end="00:16:22.740" style="s2">with the global pandemic of coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.860" end="00:16:27.630" style="s2">remaining calm is essential to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.740" end="00:16:29.160" style="s2">clearly so so before I you know I always</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.630" end="00:16:31.830" style="s2">tend to talk about my father because a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.160" end="00:16:35.190" style="s2">lot of this started with him and but</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.830" end="00:16:37.200" style="s2">even before that emotion and reason are</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.190" end="00:16:40.440" style="s2">kind of two major modes of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.200" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">functioning and when I say the brain we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.440" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">now understand from modern neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:46.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the brain it&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:47.550" style="s2">body that does the thing but we&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.110" end="00:16:50.940" style="s2">the term brain because we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.550" end="00:16:53.610" style="s2">have a better term right now but emotion</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.940" end="00:16:57.480" style="s2">and reason kind of work like a seesaw if</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.610" end="00:16:59.520" style="s2">you scare someone after death they find</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.480" end="00:17:03.030" style="s2">it very difficult to think clearly if</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.520" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">you concentrate on thinking clearly you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.030" end="00:17:08.459" style="s2">can tone that emotion down and get</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:11.459" style="s2">something done so for example I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.459" end="00:17:14.490" style="s2">you I&#39;ll tell you a little story the USS</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.459" end="00:17:16.670" style="s2">Indianapolis was the last big ship sunk</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.490" end="00:17:22.740" style="s2">in world war ii it was torpedoed by a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.670" end="00:17:25.350" style="s2">japanese submarine and 900 roughly 900</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.740" end="00:17:28.190" style="s2">guys were dumped into the water in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.350" end="00:17:33.090" style="s2">shark-infested waters in the pacific and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.190" end="00:17:35.370" style="s2">only 370 317 survived ultimately a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.090" end="00:17:37.710" style="s2">of people were eaten by sharks or just</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.370" end="00:17:39.539" style="s2">drowned a lot of them had been burned</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.710" end="00:17:42.220" style="s2">badly when the ship</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.539" end="00:17:45.580" style="s2">and there was just one officer swimming</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.220" end="00:17:48.460" style="s2">away from the mess and came upon a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.580" end="00:17:50.620" style="s2">lifeboat with about five sailors in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.460" end="00:17:52.390" style="s2">and he crawled aboard and he could see</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.620" end="00:17:54.820" style="s2">these sailors had given up they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.390" end="00:17:56.500" style="s2">covered in diesel fuel they were not</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.820" end="00:18:00.700" style="s2">doing anything they weren&#39;t talking they</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.500" end="00:18:04.690" style="s2">were kind of hang-hang dog and he pulled</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.700" end="00:18:07.450" style="s2">out his 45 service pistol and took it</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.690" end="00:18:09.370" style="s2">apart and gave each man a piece and said</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.450" end="00:18:11.380" style="s2">we&#39;re now gonna clean this pistol of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.370" end="00:18:13.390" style="s2">course this didn&#39;t make any sense there</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.380" end="00:18:17.730" style="s2">wasn&#39;t any purpose to the pistol but it</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.390" end="00:18:20.830" style="s2">was some rational deliberate organized</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.730" end="00:18:22.539" style="s2">activity that sort of gave them all a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.830" end="00:18:24.909" style="s2">purpose and woke them up out of their</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.539" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">stupor and this is an example of how the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.909" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2">brain works is that if you really are in</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:33.220" style="s2">shock or overly excited or afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.780" end="00:18:36.870" style="s2">if you can just find something to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.220" end="00:18:39.580" style="s2">that&#39;s deliberate step by step</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.870" end="00:18:42.130" style="s2">goal-oriented it helps to bring you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.580" end="00:18:44.740" style="s2">around and reorganize your thoughts so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.130" end="00:18:48.309" style="s2">being cool going back to this word</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.740" end="00:18:50.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what being cool means and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.309" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">force yourself to do it just by having</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.770" end="00:18:55.929" style="s2">something to do so like in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.900" style="s2">this coronavirus my wife Debbie and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.929" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">are stuck at home for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.900" end="00:19:03.669" style="s2">she&#39;s doing a lot of cleaning she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:05.530" style="s2">doing a lot of knitting you know there</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.669" end="00:19:08.919" style="s2">are all of these different activities</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.530" end="00:19:12.429" style="s2">you can do that that turn you into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.919" end="00:19:15.400" style="s2">person who is being cool indeed I like</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.429" end="00:19:17.409" style="s2">it you also mentioned early in the book</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.400" end="00:19:19.929" style="s2">that in your view and the view of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.409" end="00:19:22.450" style="s2">experts only 10 to 20 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.929" end="00:19:24.820" style="s2">untrained people can stay calm and think</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.450" end="00:19:27.159" style="s2">in the midst of a survival type of vet</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.820" end="00:19:28.419" style="s2">what do you think of that number and do</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.159" end="00:19:31.000" style="s2">you think that&#39;s people who are born</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.419" end="00:19:33.190" style="s2">that way built that way and how many can</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.000" end="00:19:35.590" style="s2">be trained there&#39;s a reason that elite</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.190" end="00:19:37.900" style="s2">units are very selective so are these</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.590" end="00:19:40.179" style="s2">people who are in you know naturally</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.900" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">cool and calm are they born are they</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.179" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">made can they be made I believe they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:48.610" style="s2">be made and I believe it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.880" end="00:19:50.950" style="s2">true that you can train yourself and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.610" end="00:19:52.630" style="s2">the thing that I have always said over</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.950" end="00:19:54.290" style="s2">the years and giving talks to people</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.630" end="00:19:56.940" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.290" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">is that if you practice in your daily</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.940" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">life the way you would want to be in an</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.670" style="s2">emergency you&#39;ll be much better off</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:07.950" style="s2">because in an emergency in a time of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.670" end="00:20:10.710" style="s2">high stress you don&#39;t invent new</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.950" end="00:20:13.020" style="s2">behaviors you tend to fall back on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.710" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">ones you&#39;ve already practiced and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.020" end="00:20:16.140" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you an example of how this</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:19.230" style="s2">works and I believe this is in the book</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.140" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">there was an FBI agent who decided that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.230" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">it would be a good idea to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:26.670" style="s2">snatch a gun out of span assailants</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:29.040" style="s2">hands before he could shoot this guy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.670" end="00:20:32.370" style="s2">so he practiced doing this and actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.040" end="00:20:34.620" style="s2">taught himself to be really quick with</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.370" end="00:20:36.750" style="s2">his hands and he could actually snatch a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.620" end="00:20:38.520" style="s2">gun out of somebody&#39;s hand so one day</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.750" end="00:20:39.900" style="s2">sure enough there was a bad guy on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.520" end="00:20:42.210" style="s2">street who pulled the gun on him and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.900" end="00:20:43.710" style="s2">this FBI agent snatched it out of his</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.210" end="00:20:48.150" style="s2">hands before he could do anything and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.710" end="00:20:50.700" style="s2">then he gave it back to him now this</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.150" end="00:20:53.070" style="s2">obviously is kind of a crazy thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.700" end="00:20:55.530" style="s2">and you wouldn&#39;t ever do it if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.070" end="00:20:57.390" style="s2">moment to think but when you&#39;re under</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.530" end="00:20:59.700" style="s2">high stress like that the guy just had a</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.390" end="00:21:01.260" style="s2">gun stuck in his belly he didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.700" end="00:21:03.150" style="s2">he did what he had always done and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.260" end="00:21:05.310" style="s2">during practice of course now that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.150" end="00:21:07.410" style="s2">thought about it during practice he</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.310" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">would practice with his partner snatched</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.410" end="00:21:10.500" style="s2">a gun give it back so that&#39;s a gun give</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:12.210" style="s2">it back it&#39;s nice to go and give it back</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.500" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">and so when the emergency presented</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.210" end="00:21:15.960" style="s2">itself that&#39;s what he did so this tells</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:18.780" style="s2">us some really interesting things about</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.960" end="00:21:21.180" style="s2">ourselves one is we&#39;re practicing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.780" end="00:21:24.090" style="s2">something all the time and mostly we</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.180" end="00:21:25.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is the other is if</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.090" end="00:21:28.500" style="s2">you want to be good in an emergency you</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.860" end="00:21:30.600" style="s2">should practice whatever it is you want</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.500" end="00:21:35.460" style="s2">your response to be at that time before</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.600" end="00:21:37.350" style="s2">the emergency comes so let&#39;s say are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.460" end="00:21:39.270" style="s2">the kind of person who when you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.350" end="00:21:41.610" style="s2">in a traffic jam you pound on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.270" end="00:21:43.020" style="s2">steering wheel and yell are you the kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.610" end="00:21:45.450" style="s2">of person who when you&#39;re stuck in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.020" end="00:21:47.610" style="s2">traffic jam says hey I&#39;m in America</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.450" end="00:21:48.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a traffic jam what&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.610" end="00:21:50.700" style="s2">surprise here I think I&#39;ll turn the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:54.180" style="s2">radio on and listen to some music or</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.700" end="00:21:55.950" style="s2">whatever I&#39;ll practice my French so if</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.180" end="00:21:58.650" style="s2">you have a strategy already developed</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.950" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">for being cool then it will help you</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.650" end="00:22:02.509" style="s2">when an emergency comes</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:04.429" style="s2">it makes perfect sense in fact I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.509" end="00:22:06.919" style="s2">read the last full quote in my notes</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.429" end="00:22:09.350" style="s2">which reinforces this thought which is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.919" end="00:22:12.710" style="s2">survivor builds up an account of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.350" end="00:22:15.019" style="s2">commitment over a lifetime the more he</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.710" end="00:22:19.429" style="s2">invests the more he has when trouble</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.019" end="00:22:22.039" style="s2">comes right exactly and so it&#39;s a Zen</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.429" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">way of life you don&#39;t suddenly become</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.039" end="00:22:26.929" style="s2">well some people do but most people</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:29.659" style="s2">don&#39;t suddenly become heroes in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.929" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">moment that lightning strikes you you</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.659" end="00:22:35.299" style="s2">have thought and practiced all your life</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:37.369" style="s2">certain kinds of things that lead you to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.299" end="00:22:41.119" style="s2">that moment and that you&#39;re ready then</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.369" end="00:22:45.230" style="s2">to act and so I have tried to do this in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.119" end="00:22:46.460" style="s2">my own small way but when I talk in in</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.230" end="00:22:49.309" style="s2">the end of the book there are these</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.460" end="00:22:51.769" style="s2">twelve traits of survivors that I go</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.309" end="00:22:54.440" style="s2">over and the first one is perceive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.769" end="00:22:57.999" style="s2">believe and another way I have of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.440" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">talking about this is to say be here now</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.999" end="00:23:03.110" style="s2">don&#39;t try to make things the way you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">like them to be don&#39;t try to make them</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.110" end="00:23:06.980" style="s2">the way they were yesterday don&#39;t try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:09.619" style="s2">make them the way you think they ought</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.980" end="00:23:12.889" style="s2">to be in the future although you&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.619" end="00:23:14.840" style="s2">to get there but be here now perceive</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.889" end="00:23:18.649" style="s2">and believe this is really happening you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.840" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">know I was set to go on an airplane to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.649" end="00:23:24.169" style="s2">Santa Fe a few weeks ago to be at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:27.740" style="s2">Santa Fe Institute where I&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.169" end="00:23:29.809" style="s2">for many years and I was watching the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.740" end="00:23:32.509" style="s2">news and I was watching this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.809" end="00:23:33.950" style="s2">develop and and I started talking to my</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.509" end="00:23:36.740" style="s2">wife about it and saying hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.950" end="00:23:39.499" style="s2">this thing is really big this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.740" end="00:23:42.289" style="s2">really explode and I said what if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.499" end="00:23:44.419" style="s2">stuck in Santa Fe and can&#39;t get back to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.289" end="00:23:46.460" style="s2">you in the middle of this thing because</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.419" end="00:23:49.070" style="s2">people are gonna get stuck and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.460" end="00:23:52.879" style="s2">canceled my trip and it turned out to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.070" end="00:23:55.190" style="s2">obviously the right thing to do but that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.879" end="00:23:57.289" style="s2">was after a lifetime of practicing this</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.190" end="00:23:58.999" style="s2">perceive and believed I was like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.289" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">this really is happening this is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.999" end="00:24:04.009" style="s2">just in my imagination and I can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:05.720" style="s2">about business as usual anymore yep I</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.009" end="00:24:08.029" style="s2">was gonna say I had some similar</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.720" end="00:24:10.039" style="s2">experiences around this pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.029" end="00:24:12.679" style="s2">I&#39;ve also been a person who always</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.039" end="00:24:14.230" style="s2">prided themselves on being ready</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.679" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.230" end="00:24:18.549" style="s2">we&#39;ve always been thought a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:20.500" style="s2">eccentric for my prepara shui but my</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.549" end="00:24:22.179" style="s2">social credit has gone up a lot for</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.500" end="00:24:24.760" style="s2">being a prepper over the last month or</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.179" end="00:24:27.490" style="s2">so I will say and I called every turn</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.760" end="00:24:28.990" style="s2">early right four weeks ago I said all</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.490" end="00:24:31.750" style="s2">right family we&#39;re gonna hunker down</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.990" end="00:24:34.510" style="s2">daughter and son-in-law come on down to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.750" end="00:24:36.309" style="s2">our remote mountain farm because I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.510" end="00:24:38.980" style="s2">see in exponentials that I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.309" end="00:24:41.410" style="s2">understand that this was going to be way</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.980" end="00:24:43.780" style="s2">bigger than the powers that be were</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.410" end="00:24:45.880" style="s2">letting on at the time yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.780" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s perceiving believing and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.880" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">acting as you say so you said you had</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:57.549" style="s2">another story - well in 1979 I had my</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:25:00.429" style="s2">first book published and I was very</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.549" end="00:25:03.790" style="s2">proud of this it was a big deal to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.429" end="00:25:06.210" style="s2">and it it was gonna come out that fall</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.790" end="00:25:10.660" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure in that spring in</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.210" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">preparators Bear every year it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.660" end="00:25:14.620" style="s2">the book Expo now but it&#39;s a big fair</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:16.690" style="s2">where all the publishers come they bring</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.620" end="00:25:18.820" style="s2">their new stuff and authors go to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.690" end="00:25:24.160" style="s2">promote their book so I was planning on</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.820" end="00:25:25.780" style="s2">going this was in May of 1979 and I had</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.160" end="00:25:30.070" style="s2">been the articles editor of Playboy</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.780" end="00:25:32.530" style="s2">magazine from 1970 sometime in the late</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.070" end="00:25:34.210" style="s2">70s I quit in 78 so now you&#39;re the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.530" end="00:25:38.110" style="s2">who edited all articles we allegedly</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.210" end="00:25:39.880" style="s2">bought Playboy for right well the guy</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.110" end="00:25:41.530" style="s2">who put the stuff in there that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.880" end="00:25:44.440" style="s2">supposedly bought the magazine for</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.530" end="00:25:46.540" style="s2">that&#39;s correct but I was very close to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.440" end="00:25:48.220" style="s2">these people one of them was my boss his</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.540" end="00:25:50.620" style="s2">wife had a new book that was coming out</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.220" end="00:25:54.100" style="s2">so we were all going to that fair in LA</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.620" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">the book Expo and I was always in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.100" end="00:25:58.750" style="s2">habit I still am of finding out what</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:00.580" style="s2">kind of an airplane I&#39;m flying on and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.750" end="00:26:02.860" style="s2">was doing as I said research into</p>

<p begin="00:26:02.860" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">the 70s and I had come to dislike the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.620" end="00:26:11.470" style="s2">dc-10 I had come to the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:13.840" style="s2">the dc-10 was deeply flawed and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.470" end="00:26:15.480" style="s2">dangerous airplane and it was at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.840" end="00:26:18.100" style="s2">time the only airplane that crashed</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.480" end="00:26:20.110" style="s2">strictly because of its own failures as</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.100" end="00:26:23.350" style="s2">opposed to pilot error or something and</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.499" end="00:27:56.119" style="s2">reading it no so the thing about deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.850" end="00:27:59.690" style="s2">survival and the the message that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.119" end="00:28:02.119" style="s2">preaches is just this that what you have</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.119" end="00:28:07.190" style="s2">talk and and actually take actions and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.389" end="00:28:09.139" style="s2">what you believe so and I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.190" end="00:28:11.389" style="s2">teach my kids this my younger daughter</p>

<p begin="00:28:14.210" end="00:28:18.230" style="s2">bunch of college kids were I forget</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.850" end="00:28:21.409" style="s2">where they were in Greece or someplace</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.230" end="00:28:22.610" style="s2">like that on a trip and the ocean was</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.409" end="00:28:25.460" style="s2">very bad it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.610" end="00:28:27.230" style="s2">you know big waves and they all started</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.460" end="00:28:28.850" style="s2">to run into it and she stopped them and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.230" end="00:28:29.539" style="s2">she said you know what this is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.850" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">stupid</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.539" end="00:28:33.320" style="s2">one of you is gonna drown if you get in</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:36.169" style="s2">that water and I&#39;m not gonna let you do</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.320" end="00:28:38.570" style="s2">it and and she was right and and on that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.169" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">very day some other kids elsewhere on</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.570" end="00:28:41.669" style="s2">the beach did drown because</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:43.980" style="s2">it was one of those riptide situations</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.669" end="00:28:46.650" style="s2">the key message is you have to not only</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.980" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">think this is really happening you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.650" end="00:28:51.510" style="s2">to act on your thoughts and you do talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">about how peer group pressure can erode</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.510" end="00:28:55.860" style="s2">people acting correctly and you give</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:58.230" style="s2">some examples that can you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.860" end="00:29:00.150" style="s2">that a little bit yeah one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.230" end="00:29:03.299" style="s2">that I talked about early in the book is</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.150" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">this accident with an avalanche where</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.299" end="00:29:06.870" style="s2">there is a bunch of snowmobilers who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:09.480" style="s2">rescue people they&#39;re actually going out</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.870" end="00:29:11.789" style="s2">on a search to find someone who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.480" end="00:29:14.429" style="s2">come back and they have been warned in</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.789" end="00:29:16.440" style="s2">the briefing that morning that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.429" end="00:29:19.590" style="s2">high danger of avalanche and there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.440" end="00:29:21.720" style="s2">to be any running up these hills at high</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">speeds because you&#39;re out left to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.720" end="00:29:25.350" style="s2">trigger an avalanche one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:27.539" style="s2">these snowmobilers do with their</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.350" end="00:29:29.880" style="s2">snowmobiles is they run up the hill at</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.539" end="00:29:31.529" style="s2">high speeds it&#39;s called high marking to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.880" end="00:29:32.909" style="s2">see who can go highest before having to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.529" end="00:29:34.529" style="s2">turn around and you know you lose</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.909" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">momentum and you have to come back down</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.529" end="00:29:39.299" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very exciting sport it gets</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.960" end="00:29:42.360" style="s2">very high adrenaline going and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.299" end="00:29:44.010" style="s2">lot of fun and so they&#39;re out there you</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.360" end="00:29:45.779" style="s2">know in the smell of the pines and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.010" end="00:29:48.179" style="s2">cold and they&#39;re going fast and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.779" end="00:29:51.270" style="s2">doing fun things and that emotion just</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.179" end="00:29:53.669" style="s2">kicks in and you just can&#39;t resist it</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.270" end="00:29:56.279" style="s2">and one of the guys runs up the hill -</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.669" end="00:29:57.690" style="s2">hi mark and a couple of others follow</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.279" end="00:30:00.169" style="s2">and they trigger an avalanche and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.690" end="00:30:03.299" style="s2">couple people died and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.169" end="00:30:06.299" style="s2">there&#39;s this irresistible quality to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.299" end="00:30:09.870" style="s2">pull of emotion that is responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.299" end="00:30:13.460" style="s2">our ability to act quickly our ability</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.870" end="00:30:16.200" style="s2">to act forcefully and can also you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.460" end="00:30:18.450" style="s2">trigger the herd mentality so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.200" end="00:30:20.940" style="s2">everybody begins acting that way and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.450" end="00:30:23.610" style="s2">can save us in some situations and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.940" end="00:30:26.700" style="s2">can also kill us in some situations it</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.610" end="00:30:29.429" style="s2">can undermine our willingness to act</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.700" end="00:30:33.390" style="s2">upon our beliefs right if we are vetoed</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.429" end="00:30:36.330" style="s2">by a social override more or less right</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.390" end="00:30:39.179" style="s2">and and the social the more social the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.330" end="00:30:41.429" style="s2">impulse becomes the stronger it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.179" end="00:30:43.110" style="s2">and now you&#39;re risking you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.429" end="00:30:46.200" style="s2">don&#39;t go along with it you&#39;re risking</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.110" end="00:30:48.630" style="s2">the loss of the group you&#39;re risking</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.200" end="00:30:51.149" style="s2">your status and for creatures like</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.630" end="00:30:52.740" style="s2">ourselves who are social creatures being</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.149" end="00:30:53.320" style="s2">in the group is a matter of life and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.740" end="00:30:55.510" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.320" end="00:30:58.620" style="s2">if you&#39;re put out of the group you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.510" end="00:31:01.450" style="s2">survive so status is a very big thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.620" end="00:31:03.580" style="s2">status is responsible in groups of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.450" end="00:31:06.370" style="s2">mammals for your ability to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.580" end="00:31:07.930" style="s2">your ability to get food there are all</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.370" end="00:31:10.540" style="s2">sorts of things associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.930" end="00:31:12.580" style="s2">group that are very very strong and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.540" end="00:31:14.920" style="s2">yes it&#39;s no wonder that we go along with</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.580" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">the group but being human we have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.920" end="00:31:19.930" style="s2">extra special gift of brain cells that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:23.500" style="s2">can let us think too and so the more we</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.930" end="00:31:25.330" style="s2">practice thinking as opposed to reflex</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.500" end="00:31:28.750" style="s2">reacting the better we&#39;ll be in an</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.330" end="00:31:30.910" style="s2">emergency that makes perfect sense now</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.750" end="00:31:33.310" style="s2">this is a pretty in some ways a dark</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.910" end="00:31:35.950" style="s2">book mordant in some ways but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.310" end="00:31:38.010" style="s2">some amazing humor in it too but you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.950" end="00:31:40.660" style="s2">actually call out humor as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.010" end="00:31:43.330" style="s2">characteristic of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.660" end="00:31:45.610" style="s2">actually do practice far out on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.330" end="00:31:47.710" style="s2">where these kinds of skills are</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.610" end="00:31:49.330" style="s2">important and I know my own experiences</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.710" end="00:31:51.460" style="s2">with the two groups I happen to know</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.330" end="00:31:53.170" style="s2">cops and Marines are some of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.220" end="00:32:08.620" style="s2">these people who live far out on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.560" end="00:32:11.410" style="s2">edge well it&#39;s dark humor and it needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.620" end="00:32:13.900" style="s2">to be they have very difficult things to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.410" end="00:32:15.070" style="s2">deal with I started learning this a long</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.900" end="00:32:18.370" style="s2">time ago but certainly with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.070" end="00:32:22.300" style="s2">firefighters I got used to their humor</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.370" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">and saw very clearly that what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.300" end="00:32:26.410" style="s2">doing is coping they&#39;re sort of</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.410" end="00:32:32.020" style="s2">otherwise poison their their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.380" end="00:32:36.220" style="s2">function you know essentially leading to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.020" end="00:32:38.920" style="s2">PTSD like conditions and the humor</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.220" end="00:32:42.520" style="s2">disarms that so humor serves a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.920" end="00:32:45.970" style="s2">functions but one of them is that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.520" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">reduces stress so if you can get people</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.970" end="00:32:52.210" style="s2">laughing it sort of diffuses the stress</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:56.410" style="s2">of the situation and allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.210" end="00:32:58.870" style="s2">regain your ability to function there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.410" end="00:33:00.820" style="s2">also a very interesting body of work I</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.870" end="00:33:02.560" style="s2">talked some about this in deep survival</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.820" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">around the subject called learned</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.560" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">helplessness and there&#39;s a guy named</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:09.419" style="s2">Martin Seligman who did</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:11.190" style="s2">a seminal piece of work on that but one</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.419" end="00:33:14.820" style="s2">of the interesting things they found is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.190" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">that if you can have an optimistic view</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.820" end="00:33:20.820" style="s2">of things no matter how things get no</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:23.400" style="s2">matter how bad things get if you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.820" end="00:33:25.230" style="s2">have an optimistic view of things your</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.400" end="00:33:28.429" style="s2">immune system actually functions better</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.230" end="00:33:32.190" style="s2">and they did measurements of immune</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.429" end="00:33:33.690" style="s2">functioning along with getting people to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.190" end="00:33:36.570" style="s2">tell stories about things that had</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.690" end="00:33:39.049" style="s2">happened to them and and those who could</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.570" end="00:33:42.660" style="s2">talk about bad things happening in</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.049" end="00:33:44.730" style="s2">optimistic terms had actually better</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.660" end="00:33:46.980" style="s2">immune functioning than those who were</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.730" end="00:33:48.990" style="s2">pessimistic about relating what had</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.980" end="00:33:53.070" style="s2">happened to them so there&#39;s there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.990" end="00:33:55.530" style="s2">a phenomenon about what&#39;s known as locus</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.070" end="00:33:59.370" style="s2">of control and there are kind of two</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.530" end="00:34:01.830" style="s2">kinds of people some are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.370" end="00:34:03.450" style="s2">victims by nature they say oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.830" end="00:34:04.919" style="s2">this happened to me and that happened to</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:07.350" style="s2">me and then this happened to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.919" end="00:34:08.730" style="s2">that happened to me and other people and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.350" end="00:34:11.639" style="s2">they look at the world as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.730" end="00:34:13.020" style="s2">happening to them other people view the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.639" end="00:34:15.450" style="s2">world more as something that they can</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.020" end="00:34:18.780" style="s2">control that they have agency and skills</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.450" end="00:34:21.270" style="s2">and that they can actually take a bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.780" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">situation and improve it and so I always</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.270" end="00:34:27.139" style="s2">say adversity equals opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:29.970" style="s2">those who are going to be good survivors</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.139" end="00:34:31.830" style="s2">so if something bad is happening you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.970" end="00:34:34.409" style="s2">have to look at it and figure like how</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.830" end="00:34:38.040" style="s2">can I take my advantage from this bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.409" end="00:34:39.960" style="s2">thing obviously the corona virus is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.040" end="00:34:42.770" style="s2">bad thing nobody would want that to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.960" end="00:34:46.139" style="s2">happen but it&#39;s happening now how can i</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.770" end="00:34:47.850" style="s2">benefit from it well I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.139" end="00:34:50.460" style="s2">million things you can do at home that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.850" end="00:34:53.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve always said you wanted to do get</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.460" end="00:34:57.180" style="s2">busy doing them that&#39;s what Debbie and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.399" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">are doing here at home now and if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.180" end="00:35:01.020" style="s2">just look at the world that way that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:05.310" style="s2">when something goes wrong you don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.020" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">oh my gosh you know pity me you say look</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.310" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">at that that&#39;s really too bad but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:11.220" style="s2">see how can I use that how can I work</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:15.710" style="s2">with that so I&#39;m sitting here watching</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.220" end="00:35:18.180" style="s2">my 401k evaporate and I&#39;m thinking wow</p>

<p begin="00:35:18.180" end="00:35:22.080" style="s2">prices I think I&#39;m gonna get some</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.070" end="00:35:26.250" style="s2">rather than thinking what was me I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.080" end="00:35:27.690" style="s2">never get my 401k back and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.250" end="00:35:31.080" style="s2">this is something that we all need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.690" end="00:35:33.570" style="s2">think more about yep I 100% agree I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.080" end="00:35:36.180" style="s2">never understood that either pessimism</p>

<p begin="00:38:11.150" end="00:38:16.430" style="s2">an interesting side effect and I heard</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.260" end="00:38:49.880" style="s2">the next big theme I&#39;d call it the</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:14.690" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve read a lot in this area as</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.530" end="00:39:17.089" style="s2">well but you clearly dug in very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.690" end="00:39:19.819" style="s2">into cognitive science and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.089" end="00:39:22.670" style="s2">neuroscience and particularly pointed it</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.819" end="00:39:25.640" style="s2">at how we act under high-stress</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.670" end="00:39:27.020" style="s2">situations balancing emotion and reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.640" end="00:39:29.270" style="s2">and we can&#39;t live without either one</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.020" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">right so tell us a little about your</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.270" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">view on all this Damacio is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:36.290" style="s2">and he is in deep survival and I quote</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:39.170" style="s2">him in there many things that he</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.290" end="00:39:41.270" style="s2">demonstrated but one is that if you lose</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.170" end="00:39:44.420" style="s2">the ability to have an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.270" end="00:39:47.369" style="s2">response or let&#39;s call it gut feeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.420" end="00:39:50.190" style="s2">you lose your ility to make cognitive to</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.369" end="00:39:53.609" style="s2">decisions and and this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.190" end="00:39:55.410" style="s2">revelatory thing to most Western ways of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.609" end="00:39:58.289" style="s2">thinking because we think of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.410" end="00:39:59.880" style="s2">as rational beings and we tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.289" end="00:40:02.279" style="s2">of emotion as something that just gets</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.880" end="00:40:05.190" style="s2">in the way but it&#39;s not it provides a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.279" end="00:40:07.319" style="s2">guiding service without which there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.190" end="00:40:08.039" style="s2">too many choices and we&#39;d never get</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.319" end="00:40:10.559" style="s2">anything done</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.039" end="00:40:13.170" style="s2">and he has a system of experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.559" end="00:40:16.049" style="s2">that proves this to be the case and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.170" end="00:40:18.869" style="s2">in very stressful situations in</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.049" end="00:40:21.450" style="s2">emergency situations it becomes very</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.869" end="00:40:23.880" style="s2">necessary to recruit both emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.450" end="00:40:27.119" style="s2">reason and I&#39;ll use the term gut</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.880" end="00:40:29.549" style="s2">feelings for the emotional side because</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.119" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">they are feelings about the body that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.549" end="00:40:34.799" style="s2">you get in these situations and in</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:37.859" style="s2">situations like Thinking Fast and Slow</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.799" end="00:40:40.740" style="s2">for example and our friend Cormac</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.859" end="00:40:42.779" style="s2">MacCarthy wrote about this in an essay</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.740" end="00:40:44.509" style="s2">in a magazine called Nautilus and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.779" end="00:40:47.690" style="s2">referred to it but as the night shift</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.509" end="00:40:50.430" style="s2">which is the unconscious part of our our</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.690" end="00:40:52.279" style="s2">processing we&#39;re constantly taking in</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.430" end="00:40:54.450" style="s2">information from the world and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.279" end="00:40:56.819" style="s2">processing it below the level of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.450" end="00:40:58.950" style="s2">consciousness in some fashion that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.819" end="00:41:01.319" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand we know that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.950" end="00:41:02.609" style="s2">happens but we don&#39;t know how it happens</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.319" end="00:41:05.099" style="s2">so we don&#39;t know exactly where it</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.609" end="00:41:08.190" style="s2">happens and it&#39;s a very deep subject</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.099" end="00:41:10.710" style="s2">that Cormac wrote about well and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.190" end="00:41:12.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve written about myself but is this</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.710" end="00:41:15.029" style="s2">element which can be thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.420" end="00:41:17.549" style="s2">emotion or it can be thought of as the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.029" end="00:41:19.499" style="s2">unconscious that&#39;s doing this guiding</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.549" end="00:41:21.509" style="s2">behind the scenes of what we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.499" end="00:41:23.640" style="s2">our rational selves so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.509" end="00:41:27.569" style="s2">balance that that needs to be struck to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.640" end="00:41:29.519" style="s2">do the next right thing and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.569" end="00:41:31.710" style="s2">matter of practice you can&#39;t just say</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.519" end="00:41:33.450" style="s2">here are the 10 steps to achieving that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.710" end="00:41:36.839" style="s2">balance it&#39;s something you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.450" end="00:41:41.759" style="s2">kind of all your life to to make it</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.839" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">arise reliably in an emergency so I tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.759" end="00:41:46.890" style="s2">a story about a group of wildland</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:48.779" style="s2">firefighters who were on a fire and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.890" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">remember I remember correctly it was in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.779" end="00:41:54.539" style="s2">Colorado and they were above the fire</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:56.700" style="s2">they were on a slope above the fire and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.539" end="00:41:58.440" style="s2">one of the younger and experienced</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.700" end="00:41:58.770" style="s2">firefighters took his group down the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.440" end="00:42:01.620" style="s2">slope</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.770" end="00:42:03.750" style="s2">called up on the radio to the older guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.620" end="00:42:05.430" style="s2">up on top and said hey come on down here</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.750" end="00:42:08.420" style="s2">and give us a hand and the older guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.430" end="00:42:11.370" style="s2">said sorry I&#39;m getting out of here and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.420" end="00:42:13.800" style="s2">there was something in the older guys</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.370" end="00:42:16.470" style="s2">perception of the fire that he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.800" end="00:42:18.300" style="s2">put his finger on but he just said I got</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.470" end="00:42:19.850" style="s2">a bad feeling about this and I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.300" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">out of here and he took his guys out</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.850" end="00:42:24.990" style="s2">long story short the younger guy who had</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.980" end="00:42:27.090" style="s2">gone down the slope got overrun by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.990" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">fire and the older guy with his group</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.090" end="00:42:32.280" style="s2">survived on you know away from the fire</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:34.830" style="s2">and the younger guy just hadn&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.280" end="00:42:36.750" style="s2">enough hadn&#39;t seen enough fires to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.830" end="00:42:39.090" style="s2">that gut feeling that the older guy had</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.750" end="00:42:42.290" style="s2">and this is exactly what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.090" end="00:42:44.430" style="s2">about and so no matter what your pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.290" end="00:42:46.110" style="s2">there has to come a time in your</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.430" end="00:42:51.090" style="s2">experience when you begin to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.110" end="00:42:52.710" style="s2">these cues unconsciously so that when</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.090" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">you get a bad feeling about a situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.710" end="00:42:57.930" style="s2">you&#39;re facing you go ahead and act on</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:43:00.990" style="s2">that feeling so not always as you point</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.930" end="00:43:02.790" style="s2">out sometimes these emotional hooks can</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.990" end="00:43:05.460" style="s2">send you the wrong way for instance you</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.790" end="00:43:09.450" style="s2">give the example of the scuba divers and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.460" end="00:43:11.430" style="s2">their respirators right yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.450" end="00:43:14.190" style="s2">researcher who who wrote about that a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.430" end="00:43:17.100" style="s2">woman named Daffy Mia morph you found</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.190" end="00:43:20.370" style="s2">this puzzling phenomenon going on where</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.100" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">some scuba divers would actually take</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.370" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">their masks off underwater and drown as</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">a result of it and by doing her research</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:31.370" style="s2">she discovered that certain people had</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:33.360" style="s2">this very deep emotional response to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.370" end="00:43:37.410" style="s2">suffocation and having their face</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.360" end="00:43:40.770" style="s2">covered and oddly you know became scuba</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.410" end="00:43:43.500" style="s2">divers and suffered the consequences but</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.770" end="00:43:45.450" style="s2">that this was so strong and emotion that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.500" end="00:43:49.110" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t logically think through</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.450" end="00:43:52.980" style="s2">the steps to avoid it and this to me is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.110" end="00:43:54.990" style="s2">one of those classic cases where emotion</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.980" end="00:43:56.340" style="s2">takes you in the wrong direction motion</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.990" end="00:43:56.760" style="s2">takes us in the wrong direction all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.340" end="00:43:59.670" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.760" end="00:44:01.170" style="s2">mind you when I talk about these things</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.670" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">a lot of times I&#39;ll get up in front of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.170" end="00:44:06.990" style="s2">big crowd of people and say raise your</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:09.510" style="s2">hand if you&#39;ve ever seen somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.990" end="00:44:12.380" style="s2">know make a really really bad decision</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.510" end="00:44:15.349" style="s2">in terms of a love relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.380" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">and of course if you&#39;re over 13 euro</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.349" end="00:44:20.420" style="s2">raise your hand and and then I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:23.509" style="s2">well why you know why did this person do</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.420" end="00:44:25.700" style="s2">that was this person stupid I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.509" end="00:44:27.980" style="s2">could tell because I I&#39;ve known people</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.700" end="00:44:30.170" style="s2">for example he said you know I was at my</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.980" end="00:44:32.089" style="s2">wedding I was walking down the aisle and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.170" end="00:44:35.509" style="s2">I was thinking this is really a bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.089" end="00:44:36.380" style="s2">mistake I&#39;m like well why didn&#39;t you do</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.509" end="00:44:38.990" style="s2">something about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.380" end="00:44:41.660" style="s2">well emotion can really overrun us and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.990" end="00:44:44.539" style="s2">and in love relationships it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.660" end="00:44:46.220" style="s2">illustrate because we all know examples</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.539" end="00:44:49.519" style="s2">of it like why did you marry that guy</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.220" end="00:44:51.289" style="s2">you knew he was a jerk and so in these</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.519" end="00:44:53.240" style="s2">threat situations these high-stress</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.289" end="00:44:56.119" style="s2">situations whether it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.240" end="00:44:59.240" style="s2">wilderness or it&#39;s in the financial</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.119" end="00:45:03.890" style="s2">arena to be able to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.240" end="00:45:06.259" style="s2">reassess and know when your gut feelings</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.890" end="00:45:08.769" style="s2">are helping you is I think really really</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.259" end="00:45:12.200" style="s2">important yeah you gave a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.769" end="00:45:16.490" style="s2">example when you were out with a group</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.200" end="00:45:18.650" style="s2">of f-18 pilots in training about to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.490" end="00:45:21.559" style="s2">their first or early I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.650" end="00:45:24.950" style="s2">which night landings on the carrier one</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.559" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">of the the most high stress high skill</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.950" end="00:45:29.960" style="s2">things in the life of a pilot and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:31.880" style="s2">danced back and forth between emotion</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.960" end="00:45:34.690" style="s2">and reason can you tell a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.880" end="00:45:36.680" style="s2">about that story and how reason and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.690" end="00:45:39.250" style="s2">motion have to be in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.680" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">dynamic tension to be at your top game</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.250" end="00:45:43.940" style="s2">yeah and so these are young guys they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:45.859" style="s2">very young guys in fact probably younger</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.940" end="00:45:48.200" style="s2">than my father was when he was shot down</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.859" end="00:45:49.579" style="s2">and they&#39;ve had about a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.200" end="00:45:53.150" style="s2">twenty-five hours of flight experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.579" end="00:45:55.700" style="s2">now you know having taken flight</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.150" end="00:45:58.369" style="s2">training that that&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.700" end="00:45:59.930" style="s2">many people take that long to get their</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.369" end="00:46:02.569" style="s2">private pilot&#39;s license and these guys</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.930" end="00:46:06.640" style="s2">have these multi multi-million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.569" end="00:46:09.740" style="s2">aircraft completely complex aircraft</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.640" end="00:46:11.359" style="s2">that they&#39;re strapped to so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.740" end="00:46:13.250" style="s2">have a lot of life experience behind</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.359" end="00:46:15.230" style="s2">them they don&#39;t have a lot of flying</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.250" end="00:46:18.349" style="s2">experience behind them and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.230" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">shot on a steam catapult off of a ship</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.349" end="00:46:23.299" style="s2">and they have to go around and come find</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:24.940" style="s2">the ship again and land it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.299" end="00:46:27.310" style="s2">totally crazy</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.940" end="00:46:29.829" style="s2">and as I say in the book I was on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.310" end="00:46:32.500" style="s2">LSO platform the LSO platform is where</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.829" end="00:46:35.530" style="s2">the guy who is the landing signal</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.500" end="00:46:37.240" style="s2">officer LSO stands on this little eight</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.530" end="00:46:39.819" style="s2">by eight foot platform and watches these</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.240" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">guys come in and waves them off if</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.819" end="00:46:43.150" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:45.730" style="s2">so they don&#39;t get killed and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.150" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">talking to them as well but he has bunch</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.730" end="00:46:50.589" style="s2">of lights and a switch to turn them on</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:52.869" style="s2">to tell them to go around if they</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.589" end="00:46:55.180" style="s2">they&#39;re not right and he said to me you</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.869" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">know at a quarter-mile somebody asks you</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.180" end="00:46:58.780" style="s2">what your mother&#39;s name is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:01.000" style="s2">remember because you&#39;re under such high</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.780" end="00:47:03.160" style="s2">stress at that point but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.000" end="00:47:06.490" style="s2">time you have to keep telling yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.160" end="00:47:08.650" style="s2">the rules there are certain rules you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.490" end="00:47:10.030" style="s2">don&#39;t spot the deck that means don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.650" end="00:47:11.890" style="s2">stare at the deck where you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.030" end="00:47:14.050" style="s2">land you got to keep your eyes moving or</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.890" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">you&#39;ll lose your concentration and get</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.050" end="00:47:18.130" style="s2">to low there&#39;s a light that&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:20.619" style="s2">ball and you have to keep it at a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.130" end="00:47:23.650" style="s2">certain height or you&#39;re too low or too</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.619" end="00:47:25.900" style="s2">high and so you have to be concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.650" end="00:47:27.940" style="s2">on the ball and constantly almost a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.900" end="00:47:31.359" style="s2">litany of things you&#39;re telling yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.940" end="00:47:34.150" style="s2">to do and not do as you&#39;re coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:35.950" style="s2">then just let it come on in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.150" end="00:47:38.109" style="s2">the hardest thing when you get set up</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.950" end="00:47:40.150" style="s2">for a landing like this you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.109" end="00:47:41.950" style="s2">want to touch things very much because</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.150" end="00:47:43.960" style="s2">it&#39;s all gonna be set up smoothly and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.950" end="00:47:47.609" style="s2">it&#39;ll go right to the spot you want it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.960" end="00:47:52.329" style="s2">to go to so this is a real real high</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.609" end="00:47:54.550" style="s2">high skill high training high emotion</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.329" end="00:47:56.530" style="s2">all at the same time kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.550" end="00:47:59.380" style="s2">they have some pretty dark humor about</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.530" end="00:48:02.490" style="s2">it too yeah I remember that that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.380" end="00:48:05.500" style="s2">pretty amazing the ability to master</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.490" end="00:48:08.349" style="s2">emotion and use it when necessary right</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.500" end="00:48:10.569" style="s2">but within the context of learning and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.349" end="00:48:11.800" style="s2">discipline and rules quite an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.569" end="00:48:13.630" style="s2">thing for these young people to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.800" end="00:48:15.940" style="s2">accomplished let&#39;s go on to another</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.630" end="00:48:18.040" style="s2">interesting topic which is you know who</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.940" end="00:48:20.589" style="s2">survives and who doesn&#39;t sometimes isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.040" end="00:48:22.660" style="s2">intuitively obvious you tell the story</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.589" end="00:48:25.810" style="s2">of Captain James GABA</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.660" end="00:48:27.819" style="s2">an Army Ranger who was taking a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.810" end="00:48:29.650" style="s2">commercial guided rafting trip down the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.819" end="00:48:31.540" style="s2">Gauley River in West Virginia not very</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.650" end="00:48:34.210" style="s2">far at all from where I live I live in</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.540" end="00:48:36.490" style="s2">rural western Virginia not far from the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.210" end="00:48:38.589" style="s2">West Virginia line when the raft hit a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.490" end="00:48:40.359" style="s2">rock and a captain</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.589" end="00:48:43.329" style="s2">the Army Rangers is a pretty bad dude</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.359" end="00:48:45.759" style="s2">and yet he didn&#39;t make it could you tell</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.329" end="00:48:47.589" style="s2">us about that story well and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.759" end="00:48:50.200" style="s2">another thing I talked a lot about in</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.589" end="00:48:51.999" style="s2">deep survival which is you train for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.200" end="00:48:53.890" style="s2">certain environment and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.999" end="00:48:56.799" style="s2">environment that you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.890" end="00:48:58.779" style="s2">function best in and so even though he</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.799" end="00:49:01.569" style="s2">was an Army Ranger being an Army Ranger</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.779" end="00:49:03.369" style="s2">comes with certain limitations you are</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.569" end="00:49:05.170" style="s2">trained in a certain kind of environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.369" end="00:49:08.229" style="s2">you&#39;re trained for a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.170" end="00:49:12.130" style="s2">mission you&#39;re trained you know with</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.229" end="00:49:13.719" style="s2">certain skills and not others but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.130" end="00:49:17.229" style="s2">also trained that you&#39;re like a god</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.719" end="00:49:19.869" style="s2">because in the Army Rangers if you need</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.229" end="00:49:21.819" style="s2">help you&#39;re out of the program so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.869" end="00:49:24.249" style="s2">Army Rangers are taught to be completely</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.819" end="00:49:26.829" style="s2">self-sufficient and if somebody has to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.249" end="00:49:28.779" style="s2">come and help you rescue you you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.829" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">a loser you&#39;re out you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.779" end="00:49:34.269" style="s2">become an Army Ranger and so this</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:35.979" style="s2">mindset of I won&#39;t take help can be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.269" end="00:49:39.969" style="s2">very dangerous thing when you need help</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.979" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">I mean - an Army Ranger cancer is still</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.969" end="00:49:46.479" style="s2">cancer for example - an Army Ranger</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:48.489" style="s2">indeed whitewater rapids are still</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.479" end="00:49:51.249" style="s2">whitewater rapids but this guy fell in</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.489" end="00:49:54.999" style="s2">the water and the guide who had learned</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.249" end="00:49:56.829" style="s2">his business in whitewater rapids said</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.999" end="00:49:58.239" style="s2">to him I will help you I mean in effect</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.829" end="00:50:00.069" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember what the words were but</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.239" end="00:50:02.229" style="s2">he was going to rescue this Army Ranger</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.069" end="00:50:02.789" style="s2">and the Army Ranger laughed and pushed</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.229" end="00:50:05.529" style="s2">him away</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.789" end="00:50:07.479" style="s2">which seemed to indicate to me he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.529" end="00:50:09.880" style="s2">saying like hey I&#39;m an Army Ranger I</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.479" end="00:50:12.099" style="s2">don&#39;t need your help and and then he</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.880" end="00:50:14.140" style="s2">drowned because he had not specifically</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.099" end="00:50:17.670" style="s2">been trained in this hazard that he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.140" end="00:50:20.200" style="s2">entering and so the lesson is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.670" end="00:50:22.749" style="s2">well one of the survival instructor does</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.200" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">instructors that I talked to said you</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.749" end="00:50:28.269" style="s2">know the the Rambo types are the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:30.339" style="s2">to go and I think there&#39;s a lesson in</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.269" end="00:50:33.279" style="s2">that one of the things that I preached</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.339" end="00:50:34.839" style="s2">in deep survival is humility no matter</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.279" end="00:50:36.759" style="s2">how much you&#39;ve learned no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.839" end="00:50:39.069" style="s2">much you&#39;ve done no matter what your</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.759" end="00:50:40.569" style="s2">credentials are be humble because</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.069" end="00:50:42.450" style="s2">there&#39;s something waiting out there to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.569" end="00:50:45.640" style="s2">get you and you don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.450" end="00:50:47.710" style="s2">and sometimes you should know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.640" end="00:50:49.869" style="s2">but you somehow get a tunnel vision or a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.710" end="00:50:52.210" style="s2">mental constriction you gave another</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.869" end="00:50:54.940" style="s2">very interesting example which see</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.210" end="00:50:56.500" style="s2">to defy any common sense which was this</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.940" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">event that happened on the Illinois</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.500" end="00:51:01.660" style="s2">River in Oregon where a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:03.910" style="s2">were rafting and the condition suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.660" end="00:51:05.770" style="s2">changed and it water became very high</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.910" end="00:51:08.760" style="s2">and some people had the sense to pull</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.770" end="00:51:11.560" style="s2">over and others did yeah and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.760" end="00:51:14.140" style="s2">this is a common phenomenon we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.560" end="00:51:17.170" style="s2">it right now with the coronavirus people</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.140" end="00:51:20.140" style="s2">we know who said why you know I already</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.170" end="00:51:24.580" style="s2">paid for the the cruise and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.140" end="00:51:26.589" style="s2">planning it for you know a year and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.580" end="00:51:29.170" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go and then they get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.589" end="00:51:30.580" style="s2">you know they can&#39;t come back and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.170" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">they&#39;re stuck on the ship somewhere at</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.580" end="00:51:36.670" style="s2">sea and there is this sense in these</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:38.440" style="s2">adventure episodes that I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.670" end="00:51:41.770" style="s2">like the one you&#39;re you&#39;re mentioning on</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.440" end="00:51:43.900" style="s2">the river it&#39;s like well we had to drive</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.770" end="00:51:46.270" style="s2">for 12 hours to get here and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.900" end="00:51:49.000" style="s2">already booked our motel and we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.270" end="00:51:50.890" style="s2">our kayaks here and we&#39;ve never had any</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.000" end="00:51:54.070" style="s2">trouble before and there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.890" end="00:51:56.530" style="s2">kind of excuses that people make to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.070" end="00:51:59.260" style="s2">themselves to convince themselves to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.530" end="00:52:01.680" style="s2">the wrong thing and and this is another</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.260" end="00:52:04.359" style="s2">thing I talked about which is expert</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.680" end="00:52:07.750" style="s2">often means you&#39;ve done the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.359" end="00:52:09.339" style="s2">more times than I have and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.750" end="00:52:12.790" style="s2">say well we never had any problem before</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.339" end="00:52:14.200" style="s2">we always do it this way and and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.790" end="00:52:16.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the time it&#39;s going to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.200" end="00:52:20.230" style="s2">so in this incident you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.810" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">on the river the river became really way</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.230" end="00:52:24.910" style="s2">too high to be run and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:26.680" style="s2">kayakers actually got in touch with me</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.910" end="00:52:28.930" style="s2">after deeps arrival came out some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.680" end="00:52:30.460" style="s2">ones who survived and said well you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.930" end="00:52:32.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not to hide around it just takes</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.460" end="00:52:34.750" style="s2">expert skill well some of the experts</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.440" end="00:52:36.550" style="s2">died too and people continued thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.750" end="00:52:39.270" style="s2">that way often right up until the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.550" end="00:52:42.930" style="s2">it kills them but there&#39;s no shame in</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.270" end="00:52:45.270" style="s2">turning back from the summit I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.930" end="00:52:47.320" style="s2">intelligent mountain climbers I know</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.270" end="00:52:49.540" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s more than one</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.320" end="00:52:51.880" style="s2">place on the mountain to go and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.540" end="00:52:54.550" style="s2">there&#39;s always another day so just to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.880" end="00:52:57.339" style="s2">use that analogy the same is true with</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.550" end="00:52:58.719" style="s2">the river there&#39;s always another day</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.339" end="00:53:02.049" style="s2">and the thing that people lose sight of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.719" end="00:53:04.089" style="s2">is what I call the risk reward loop so</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.049" end="00:53:06.130" style="s2">what is the reward you&#39;re seeking here</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.089" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">you know you&#39;re gonna go run the river</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.130" end="00:53:10.180" style="s2">business your life&#39;s work are you just</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:12.819" style="s2">on vacation and what are you willing to</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.180" end="00:53:14.829" style="s2">pay for that that reward is fine</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.819" end="00:53:17.289" style="s2">it&#39;s like running up the Avalanche slope</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.829" end="00:53:20.049" style="s2">with your snowmobile there&#39;s a good good</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.289" end="00:53:22.329" style="s2">reward there it&#39;s a fun feeling but is</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.049" end="00:53:24.339" style="s2">it worth your life and we always have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.329" end="00:53:27.390" style="s2">ask ourselves what&#39;s the risk what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.339" end="00:53:30.670" style="s2">this gonna cost if everything goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.390" end="00:53:32.680" style="s2">indeed and then the other point lack of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.670" end="00:53:34.299" style="s2">judgment tunnel vision overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.680" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">working memory whatever it is it causes</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.299" end="00:53:40.359" style="s2">people to make these very bad often</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:42.249" style="s2">disastrous decisions becomes even</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.359" end="00:53:45.729" style="s2">greater when you&#39;re physically or</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.249" end="00:53:48.369" style="s2">mentally impaired like by hypothermia or</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.729" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">dehydration fatigue or even in the case</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.369" end="00:53:51.249" style="s2">of the snowmobilers kind of a blood up</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:53.170" style="s2">exuberance</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.249" end="00:53:55.029" style="s2">yeah well talk about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.170" end="00:53:57.069" style="s2">and how people don&#39;t notice that there</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.029" end="00:54:00.759" style="s2">because actually hypothermia famously</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.069" end="00:54:02.109" style="s2">sneaks up on people yeah well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.759" end="00:54:05.140" style="s2">there&#39;s one case that I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.109" end="00:54:07.719" style="s2">about recently that two ice climbers</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.140" end="00:54:09.369" style="s2">were they were kind of going to the next</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.719" end="00:54:11.410" style="s2">level they had done some ice climbing</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.369" end="00:54:13.450" style="s2">and they wanted to go challenge</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.410" end="00:54:15.279" style="s2">themselves a little more and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.450" end="00:54:18.249" style="s2">some beautiful ice climbing routes on</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.279" end="00:54:20.109" style="s2">Mount Washington in New Hampshire not</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.249" end="00:54:22.269" style="s2">Washington in New Hampshire has the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.109" end="00:54:24.190" style="s2">worst weather in the world and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.269" end="00:54:27.009" style="s2">big sign they&#39;re put up by the Rangers</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.190" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">says this mountain has the worst weather</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.009" end="00:54:33.190" style="s2">in the world it will kill you and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:34.630" style="s2">not like maybe or maybe the worst</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.190" end="00:54:36.549" style="s2">weather in the world it&#39;s like this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.630" end="00:54:38.019" style="s2">the worst weather in the world and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.549" end="00:54:40.839" style="s2">kind of because of this perfect storm</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.019" end="00:54:42.609" style="s2">that runs across the top and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.839" end="00:54:44.979" style="s2">it&#39;s not always that way I&#39;ve climbed</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.609" end="00:54:47.289" style="s2">Mount Washington on a day when people</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.979" end="00:54:49.119" style="s2">were in flip-flops and shorts but</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.289" end="00:54:51.549" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s that way and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:54.579" style="s2">ice it&#39;s winter and if it&#39;s winter it</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.549" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">can be that way really quickly so these</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.579" end="00:54:58.599" style="s2">two guys went out to do their ice climb</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:55:01.059" style="s2">which would probably have been fine</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.599" end="00:55:04.089" style="s2">except they forgot their rope back at</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.059" end="00:55:06.910" style="s2">the cabin so they had to go back to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.089" end="00:55:09.700" style="s2">their rope and that put them a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.910" end="00:55:11.330" style="s2">hours behind their schedule which was to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.700" end="00:55:12.860" style="s2">climb the ice get</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.330" end="00:55:14.540" style="s2">the top and there was a walk off route</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.860" end="00:55:17.270" style="s2">from the top where they could have just</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.540" end="00:55:19.790" style="s2">hiked back home so instead they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.270" end="00:55:22.040" style="s2">getting up on the ice and it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.790" end="00:55:24.260" style="s2">later in the day and it&#39;s getting colder</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.040" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">and some weather&#39;s moving in very</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.260" end="00:55:28.700" style="s2">unpredictable weather and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:31.430" style="s2">just rappelling off and going back they</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.700" end="00:55:33.980" style="s2">keep going and part of the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.430" end="00:55:36.200" style="s2">that they were stressed because they had</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.980" end="00:55:37.550" style="s2">made a big mistake you know go rice ice</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.200" end="00:55:40.970" style="s2">climbing without your rope</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.550" end="00:55:43.400" style="s2">they had hurried they had skipped eating</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.970" end="00:55:45.140" style="s2">because they were late and then they had</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.400" end="00:55:47.030" style="s2">scrambled up the ice as fast as they</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.140" end="00:55:49.700" style="s2">could wearing themselves out so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.030" end="00:55:52.700" style="s2">on the ice they were tired they were</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.700" end="00:55:55.190" style="s2">cold they were sweaty so their sweat</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.700" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">started to get cold and as they got</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.190" end="00:55:59.510" style="s2">hypothermic they lost their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:02.060" style="s2">reason and just kept going right on up</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.510" end="00:56:05.030" style="s2">by the time they got to the top the bad</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.060" end="00:56:07.220" style="s2">weather had arrived and it gets to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.030" end="00:56:08.390" style="s2">the wind there gets to oh well over a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.220" end="00:56:11.000" style="s2">hundred miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.390" end="00:56:12.920" style="s2">and it gets way way way below zero and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.000" end="00:56:14.690" style="s2">so there they were on the top and a</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.920" end="00:56:18.170" style="s2">hundred mile an hour wind trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.690" end="00:56:20.090" style="s2">crawl their way over to a trail that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.170" end="00:56:22.820" style="s2">they weren&#39;t quite sure where it was and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.090" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">they died they died of exposure right</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.820" end="00:56:28.310" style="s2">there on the top Wow basically their</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:30.380" style="s2">cognitive ability was degraded by you</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.310" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">know ever-increasing levels of physical</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.380" end="00:56:35.450" style="s2">depletion which then became mental</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">depletion yeah exactly now you talk</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.450" end="00:56:39.320" style="s2">about a deeper concept this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:42.050" style="s2">time I&#39;ve ever seen anybody actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.320" end="00:56:43.490" style="s2">address this which is fatigue and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.050" end="00:56:45.860" style="s2">know you make the point that fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.490" end="00:56:48.380" style="s2">isn&#39;t just being tired but it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.860" end="00:56:50.210" style="s2">more systemic thing that is much harder</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.380" end="00:56:53.090" style="s2">to recover from could you riff a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.210" end="00:56:56.180" style="s2">bit on fatigue yep fatigue if you get</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.090" end="00:56:58.250" style="s2">into real fatigue not just I&#39;m tired</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.180" end="00:57:00.650" style="s2">you won&#39;t recover by just going to bed</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.250" end="00:57:04.430" style="s2">and sleeping it off it&#39;s kind of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.650" end="00:57:09.620" style="s2">systemic wound to the system if you will</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.430" end="00:57:11.150" style="s2">an energy deficit so big that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.620" end="00:57:14.540" style="s2">actually probably came close to dying</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.150" end="00:57:17.150" style="s2">from it and and it will take you quite a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.540" end="00:57:19.970" style="s2">period of time to recover you know not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.150" end="00:57:23.360" style="s2">day maybe a week different people</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.970" end="00:57:24.920" style="s2">respond differently but but you see it</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.360" end="00:57:28.130" style="s2">in speaking of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.920" end="00:57:30.260" style="s2">Army Rangers in the Rangers and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.130" end="00:57:32.120" style="s2">known a number of these guys you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.260" end="00:57:35.960" style="s2">taken to that level of fatigue and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.120" end="00:57:38.240" style="s2">stress on purpose for training and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.960" end="00:57:40.700" style="s2">can kill you actually these guys risk</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.240" end="00:57:43.340" style="s2">their lives doing this but one of them I</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.700" end="00:57:45.410" style="s2">was working with the 82nd airborne at</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.340" end="00:57:48.980" style="s2">Fort Bragg and one of the guys I worked</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.410" end="00:57:50.750" style="s2">with was a ranger and I said tell me</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.980" end="00:57:54.110" style="s2">about the training and he said when he</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.750" end="00:57:56.330" style="s2">got back from the training he slept for</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.110" end="00:57:58.850" style="s2">like eighteen days he said I would wake</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.330" end="00:58:01.640" style="s2">up I eat you know five or six sandwiches</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.850" end="00:58:04.960" style="s2">and I&#39;d go back to sleep and and he said</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.640" end="00:58:09.290" style="s2">it was just like bone bone deep</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:11.750" style="s2">tiredness that didn&#39;t go away for a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.290" end="00:58:13.700" style="s2">long time and so it&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.750" end="00:58:16.580" style="s2">just getting tired so if you if you do a</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.700" end="00:58:19.010" style="s2">normal outing where you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.580" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">even even something like climbing</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.010" end="00:58:23.720" style="s2">Everest you know when you start from the</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:26.570" style="s2">base camp you get up to the top and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.720" end="00:58:28.790" style="s2">morning and you come back down and if</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.570" end="00:58:30.380" style="s2">everything goes as planned you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.790" end="00:58:32.810" style="s2">going to be in deep fatigue you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.380" end="00:58:34.310" style="s2">be tired and of course there&#39;s no oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.810" end="00:58:36.650" style="s2">up there to speak of and so you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.310" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">have that too but once you get down to</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.650" end="00:58:41.780" style="s2">base camp to the lower base camps you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:43.940" style="s2">recover pretty quickly everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.780" end="00:58:46.310" style="s2">different as I say so if it&#39;s seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.940" end="00:58:48.110" style="s2">a very special case and it can it can be</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.310" end="00:58:50.780" style="s2">lethal I think one of the most useful</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.110" end="00:58:53.540" style="s2">takeaways in your book you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.780" end="00:58:55.400" style="s2">basically described it as if you are in</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.540" end="00:58:58.100" style="s2">a survival situation let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.400" end="00:58:59.960" style="s2">become hopelessly lost or a survivor</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.100" end="00:59:02.300" style="s2">after an airplane crash you make the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.960" end="00:59:03.580" style="s2">point and the experts make the point you</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.300" end="00:59:06.860" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get fatigued so</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.580" end="00:59:09.170" style="s2">surprisingly the right answer most of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.860" end="00:59:11.240" style="s2">the time is to take it easy rest a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.170" end="00:59:13.400" style="s2">think the number you quoted was try not</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.240" end="00:59:15.560" style="s2">to use more than 60% of your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.400" end="00:59:18.770" style="s2">because if you fall into fatigue you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.560" end="00:59:21.080" style="s2">probably doomed yeah so there&#39;s a guy</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.770" end="00:59:24.680" style="s2">this is just a way of thinking I like</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.080" end="00:59:26.360" style="s2">very much and I interviewed him but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.680" end="00:59:27.860" style="s2">was too late to get into the book but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.360" end="00:59:31.250" style="s2">do tell this story quite a bit because</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.860" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">it fits right in with deep survival his</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.250" end="00:59:37.539" style="s2">name was Vito sakuni&#39;s and he was going</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:42.389" style="s2">for a solo cross-country ski in</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.539" end="00:59:42.389" style="s2">Grand Teton National Park one winter and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.419" end="00:59:47.009" style="s2">Jimmy parked in the parking lot went out</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.589" end="00:59:51.009" style="s2">on his skis got out about five miles and</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.009" end="00:59:53.829" style="s2">hit a hit a downslope the wrong way and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.009" end="00:59:57.579" style="s2">twisted his ankle and did a torsion</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.829" end="01:00:00.189" style="s2">fracture of his leg in his boot so he</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.579" end="01:00:03.279" style="s2">just fell the wrong way and literally</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.189" end="01:00:06.279" style="s2">torqued his leg til it had a spiral</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.279" end="01:00:08.739" style="s2">fracture in it and he knew that was it I</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.279" end="01:00:10.749" style="s2">mean he wasn&#39;t going anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.739" end="01:00:12.789" style="s2">and he knew nobody&#39;s coming down this</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.749" end="01:00:16.239" style="s2">trail in the middle of a winter like</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.789" end="01:00:18.719" style="s2">that it&#39;s very remote trail but he was a</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.239" end="01:00:22.259" style="s2">good outdoorsman and he had packed well</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.719" end="01:00:24.759" style="s2">so he immediately sat down where he was</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.259" end="01:00:26.739" style="s2">he didn&#39;t try to take his boot off or</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.759" end="01:00:29.380" style="s2">you know splint it or anything like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.739" end="01:00:32.499" style="s2">he sat down and he unpacked all his gear</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.380" end="01:00:35.380" style="s2">and he set up his tent and he took out</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.499" end="01:00:37.719" style="s2">his stove and he melted some snow he</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.380" end="01:00:40.209" style="s2">made himself a hot drink and then he</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.719" end="01:00:42.849" style="s2">made himself a meal and he looked at all</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.209" end="01:00:44.759" style="s2">of his equipment and assessed what he</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.849" end="01:00:46.839" style="s2">needed and what he didn&#39;t need and</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.759" end="01:00:49.239" style="s2">decided that the only way he was going</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.839" end="01:00:52.539" style="s2">to get out of there was to scoot on his</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.239" end="01:00:54.899" style="s2">butt even though that was really slow</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.539" end="01:00:57.429" style="s2">and difficult and painful and all that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.899" end="01:00:58.689" style="s2">so there are a number of things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.429" end="01:01:01.299" style="s2">gonna tell you the second half of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.689" end="01:01:02.739" style="s2">story in a second but first of all what</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.299" end="01:01:05.349" style="s2">he did goes back to what we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.739" end="01:01:07.749" style="s2">about reason and emotion he broke his</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.349" end="01:01:10.929" style="s2">leg out there by himself very high</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.749" end="01:01:13.419" style="s2">emotion very high stress he sat down and</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.929" end="01:01:15.849" style="s2">immediately made himself a hot drink</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.419" end="01:01:18.249" style="s2">organized his stuff made himself a meal</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.849" end="01:01:20.939" style="s2">he&#39;s doing exactly the right thing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.249" end="01:01:23.949" style="s2">using reason he&#39;s using step-by-step</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.939" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">methods to achieve a goal and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.949" end="01:01:28.209" style="s2">nourishing himself he&#39;s replenishing his</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:30.130" style="s2">energy and he&#39;s warming himself up with</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.209" end="01:01:32.889" style="s2">the hot drink so these are all like</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.130" end="01:01:35.169" style="s2">amazingly just right deep survival kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.889" end="01:01:38.259" style="s2">of moves then he decides on a strategy</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.169" end="01:01:40.479" style="s2">so he&#39;s made he stayed calm he first of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.259" end="01:01:42.479" style="s2">all perceive and believe I did really</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.479" end="01:01:46.059" style="s2">break my leg I am really stuck out here</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.479" end="01:01:49.449" style="s2">secondly you know they make a plan</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.059" end="01:01:51.390" style="s2">stay calm he did that think analyse plan</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.449" end="01:01:54.059" style="s2">these are things I say in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.390" end="01:01:55.950" style="s2">arrival and then take correct decisive</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.059" end="01:01:57.779" style="s2">action so I&#39;m gonna scoot upon my butt</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.950" end="01:02:00.059" style="s2">now how am I going to manage that for</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.779" end="01:02:01.950" style="s2">five miles to the parking lot he decided</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.059" end="01:02:04.769" style="s2">that he would devote every hundred moves</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.950" end="01:02:07.890" style="s2">to something back at home that he loved</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.769" end="01:02:09.829" style="s2">and wanted to get back to alive so he</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.890" end="01:02:13.740" style="s2">dedicated 100 moves to his wife</p>

<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:24.420" style="s2">hundred moves he&#39;d think of something</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.559" end="01:02:27.240" style="s2">else in his life that he really really</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.420" end="01:02:30.180" style="s2">wanted to get back in and by goodness he</p>

<p begin="01:02:30.180" end="01:02:34.230" style="s2">got fixed up so I love telling this</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.190" end="01:02:36.539" style="s2">story because it embodies so much of</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.230" end="01:02:37.950" style="s2">what&#39;s in deep survival this guy just</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.539" end="01:02:40.319" style="s2">did it perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.950" end="01:02:43.109" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s a lesson for us all</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:46.619" style="s2">okay certainly he exemplified the idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.109" end="01:02:48.420" style="s2">of actual coolness under fire right to</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.619" end="01:02:50.549" style="s2">be able to do that suffer a spiral</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.420" end="01:02:52.200" style="s2">fracture and then calmly inventory your</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.549" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">material and make yourself a cup of tea</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.200" end="01:02:58.650" style="s2">my god that is a cool cat yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:02:59.880" style="s2">great story another point I&#39;ll call out</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.650" end="01:03:01.559" style="s2">from that story and this is something</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.880" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">you mentioned it must be a half dozen</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.559" end="01:03:06.630" style="s2">times throughout the book is that many</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:09.660" style="s2">people who actually do survive seemed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.630" end="01:03:11.910" style="s2">have motivated themselves by living for</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.660" end="01:03:13.799" style="s2">other people yes for their people back</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.910" end="01:03:16.230" style="s2">home their wife or their children or</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.799" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">they want to see that grandchild about</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.230" end="01:03:22.079" style="s2">that a little bit yes so I noticed and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:24.059" style="s2">do write about this quite a bit in deep</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:26.369" style="s2">survival that if you&#39;re in a bad</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.059" end="01:03:29.519" style="s2">situation if there&#39;s an emergency you</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.369" end="01:03:31.890" style="s2">know a World Trade Center or something</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.519" end="01:03:34.950" style="s2">like that people do a lot better if they</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.890" end="01:03:38.279" style="s2">have somebody to help so by by helping</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.950" end="01:03:41.190" style="s2">someone else you stop becoming a victim</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.279" end="01:03:42.779" style="s2">and you start becoming a rescuer and as</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.190" end="01:03:45.390" style="s2">a rescuer I mean that has a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.779" end="01:03:49.140" style="s2">meanings in our culture and probably in</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.390" end="01:03:51.299" style="s2">all cultures you&#39;re taking control which</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.140" end="01:03:53.390" style="s2">is an extremely important element of</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.299" end="01:03:57.029" style="s2">survival to have a sense of control</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.390" end="01:03:58.890" style="s2">you&#39;re taking this internal locus of</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.029" end="01:04:01.589" style="s2">control that I talked about before I can</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.890" end="01:04:03.480" style="s2">do useful things yes even in the face of</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.589" end="01:04:05.850" style="s2">this terrible situation I</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.480" end="01:04:08.820" style="s2">find something useful to do you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.850" end="01:04:10.560" style="s2">having a positive attitude you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.820" end="01:04:13.410" style="s2">optimistic because you believe you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.560" end="01:04:15.359" style="s2">do something which I said you know helps</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.410" end="01:04:17.550" style="s2">you in every way including your immune</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.359" end="01:04:19.950" style="s2">system which can be important at this</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.550" end="01:04:23.130" style="s2">particular time in our lives and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.950" end="01:04:26.850" style="s2">always latching on to something somebody</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.130" end="01:04:29.640" style="s2">you can help is a great idea and and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.850" end="01:04:31.950" style="s2">think in statistically we found that</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.640" end="01:04:34.590" style="s2">doctors and nurses tend to survive</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.950" end="01:04:36.440" style="s2">better in critical situations because of</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.590" end="01:04:38.820" style="s2">the fact that they&#39;ve got people to help</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.440" end="01:04:42.300" style="s2">but anyone can do this I mean you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.820" end="01:04:45.030" style="s2">always be helping others and in deadly</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.300" end="01:04:50.280" style="s2">survival situations I know I wrote about</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.030" end="01:04:54.630" style="s2">one photographer I worked with he was a</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.280" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">whitewater raft or guy kayaker and he</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.630" end="01:04:59.580" style="s2">had gotten trapped in a strainer which</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:03.180" style="s2">is a tree that&#39;s fallen across the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.580" end="01:05:05.760" style="s2">water and it sucked his boat in and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.180" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">current is pushing you into this mess of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:09.810" style="s2">branches so every time he&#39;d get his head</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:10.350" style="s2">above water would push him back down</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.810" end="01:05:14.550" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.350" end="01:05:15.990" style="s2">and he was no he was bounding and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.550" end="01:05:18.660" style="s2">have the strength to keep pulling</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.990" end="01:05:20.310" style="s2">himself up like that he&#39;d catch a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.660" end="01:05:22.230" style="s2">breath and the the current would push</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.310" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">him down again and he&#39;d have to pull up</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.230" end="01:05:26.760" style="s2">again and I said well how did you you</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.720" end="01:05:28.980" style="s2">know how did you get out he said well I</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.760" end="01:05:30.780" style="s2">thought about my son and I thought you</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.980" end="01:05:32.430" style="s2">know he had like a four year old son he</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.780" end="01:05:35.640" style="s2">said I&#39;ve got to see my son again I</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.430" end="01:05:38.250" style="s2">can&#39;t let him I can&#39;t let this be the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.640" end="01:05:40.080" style="s2">last gift I give to my son and he just</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.250" end="01:05:41.730" style="s2">found superhuman strength and bolted</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.080" end="01:05:46.800" style="s2">himself up on top of this tree and got</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.730" end="01:05:49.290" style="s2">out and that&#39;s a classic example of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.800" end="01:05:51.690" style="s2">situation we&#39;ve all heard this story</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.290" end="01:05:53.340" style="s2">like the old granny is looking out the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.690" end="01:05:55.619" style="s2">kitchen window washing the dishes and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.340" end="01:05:57.480" style="s2">the car falls on her husband who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.619" end="01:05:59.430" style="s2">underneath it changing the oil or</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.480" end="01:06:00.750" style="s2">whatever and she rushes out and lifts</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.430" end="01:06:04.200" style="s2">the car off of him even though she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.750" end="01:06:06.839" style="s2">only 5 feet tall and a 99 pound</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.200" end="01:06:08.849" style="s2">and how is it possible well it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.839" end="01:06:11.130" style="s2">possible there&#39;s an instance of it in</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.849" end="01:06:12.690" style="s2">the book it&#39;s possible because we have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.130" end="01:06:16.200" style="s2">lot more strength than we use day-to-day</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.690" end="01:06:19.470" style="s2">and the special emotional state can give</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.200" end="01:06:21.300" style="s2">us access to it yep it seems to be I saw</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.470" end="01:06:23.700" style="s2">that pattern appear in several of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.300" end="01:06:25.470" style="s2">stories now let&#39;s move on to the next</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.700" end="01:06:27.420" style="s2">topic I frankly don&#39;t remember from the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.470" end="01:06:29.790" style="s2">first time I read the book but the very</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.420" end="01:06:32.820" style="s2">interesting line of discourse about</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.790" end="01:06:35.099" style="s2">Charles Perrault who studied industrial</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.820" end="01:06:37.349" style="s2">accidents in nuclear power plants</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.099" end="01:06:40.410" style="s2">airlines shipping etc and wrote a book</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.349" end="01:06:42.329" style="s2">called normal accidents where he makes I</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.410" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">would call it a complex systems type</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.329" end="01:06:47.430" style="s2">claim that systems that are organized in</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:50.040" style="s2">a certain way are just likely to have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.430" end="01:06:51.450" style="s2">power-law distribution of accidents you</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.040" end="01:06:53.910" style="s2">know not all that different from pierre</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.450" end="01:06:56.490" style="s2">bach and his sand piles could you talk</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.910" end="01:06:58.560" style="s2">about that a little bit yes so Charles</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.490" end="01:07:01.530" style="s2">Perrault and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.560" end="01:07:04.470" style="s2">around came up with this idea first as</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.530" end="01:07:06.750" style="s2">far as I know it was that these systems</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.470" end="01:07:09.390" style="s2">are so complex that the accident is</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.750" end="01:07:12.569" style="s2">built into the nature of the system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.390" end="01:07:14.700" style="s2">not a system where you can say you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.569" end="01:07:16.530" style="s2">if we did this and this will prevent all</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.700" end="01:07:18.960" style="s2">accidents that&#39;s not the way it works</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.530" end="01:07:21.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like as you say it&#39;s a power-law</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.960" end="01:07:24.270" style="s2">it&#39;s like earthquakes there are a whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.599" end="01:07:26.280" style="s2">bunch of little accidents little mishaps</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.270" end="01:07:30.829" style="s2">that go wrong and then every once in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.280" end="01:07:33.660" style="s2">while there&#39;s a huge one and his concept</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.829" end="01:07:36.630" style="s2">began to change the way industry looked</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.660" end="01:07:40.230" style="s2">at certain things by saying you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.630" end="01:07:42.630" style="s2">just identifying a hazard and slapping a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.230" end="01:07:45.150" style="s2">technical fix on it may actually just</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.630" end="01:07:47.940" style="s2">make the system more complex and make it</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.150" end="01:07:50.430" style="s2">more prone to failure an accident so</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.940" end="01:07:53.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a real rethinking of the industry</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.430" end="01:07:56.970" style="s2">as you talked about there is truth in</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.640" end="01:07:58.800" style="s2">this and it applies in our daily</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.970" end="01:08:01.079" style="s2">activities and it certainly applies in</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.800" end="01:08:05.069" style="s2">places like you know wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.079" end="01:08:06.630" style="s2">adventure travel and it applies in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.069" end="01:08:09.390" style="s2">stock market you know things like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.630" end="01:08:12.060" style="s2">where they&#39;re going to be you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.390" end="01:08:14.790" style="s2">little breakouts and huge breakouts in</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.060" end="01:08:16.690" style="s2">each direction and the huge ones are</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.790" end="01:08:20.319" style="s2">less likely than the little ones</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.690" end="01:08:24.100" style="s2">it also applies to social and biological</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.319" end="01:08:26.799" style="s2">systems so we are now witnessing with</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.100" end="01:08:30.250" style="s2">the coronavirus an example of a normal</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.799" end="01:08:34.120" style="s2">accident it is part of the normal</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.250" end="01:08:36.310" style="s2">functioning of the scheme of human</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.120" end="01:08:38.170" style="s2">interaction that there are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.310" end="01:08:40.359" style="s2">illnesses that spread rapidly through</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.170" end="01:08:42.759" style="s2">the population as long as people can</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.359" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">contact one another so if there were no</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.759" end="01:08:47.799" style="s2">such thing as that modern travel we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:50.170" style="s2">we would not have this virus globally</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.799" end="01:08:52.600" style="s2">right now but that&#39;s the system we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.170" end="01:08:54.790" style="s2">we created it and it&#39;s subject to normal</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.600" end="01:08:58.089" style="s2">accidents so the more that we can think</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.790" end="01:09:00.580" style="s2">about these systems in those terms this</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.089" end="01:09:03.400" style="s2">is a complex system and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.580" end="01:09:06.130" style="s2">have these kind of accidents I think it</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.400" end="01:09:08.199" style="s2">comes down to saying yes these accidents</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.130" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">are going to happen to people but they</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.199" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have to happen to you and so that</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:15.400" style="s2">means figuring out the strategy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:17.529" style="s2">going to keep you out of the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.400" end="01:09:20.560" style="s2">workings of the system I use a</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.529" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">mountaineering accident on Mount Hood as</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.560" end="01:09:25.960" style="s2">an example of this where all these</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:28.299" style="s2">people were climbing the mountain and</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.960" end="01:09:30.580" style="s2">they were roped together but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.299" end="01:09:33.400" style="s2">rope they didn&#39;t connect the rope to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.580" end="01:09:35.650" style="s2">mountain so it was it was just like a</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.400" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">suicide pact there were several</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.650" end="01:09:41.949" style="s2">different groups one at the top fell</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:43.930" style="s2">three guys roped together they</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.949" end="01:09:45.430" style="s2">encountered another group halfway up</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.930" end="01:09:48.069" style="s2">that was roped together and dragged them</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.430" end="01:09:50.380" style="s2">off and they in turn encountered another</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.069" end="01:09:53.440" style="s2">group below that was roped together and</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.380" end="01:09:56.620" style="s2">took them off so all these people became</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.440" end="01:09:58.120" style="s2">this complex system and like I say it</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.620" end="01:10:00.070" style="s2">was inevitable that an accident like</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.120" end="01:10:04.150" style="s2">this would happen but it didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.070" end="01:10:06.310" style="s2">happen to me if you like yeah I found</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.150" end="01:10:08.260" style="s2">that story the bounded debacle I have it</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.310" end="01:10:09.880" style="s2">in my notes and you go into great detail</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.260" end="01:10:11.800" style="s2">it&#39;s in some ways the most</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.880" end="01:10:13.719" style="s2">fully-developed of all the stories and</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.800" end="01:10:16.360" style="s2">you talk about how it tightly coupled</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.719" end="01:10:18.969" style="s2">the systems become and how the people</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.360" end="01:10:20.770" style="s2">involved no idea about the energies that</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.969" end="01:10:23.469" style="s2">were available if you fall a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.770" end="01:10:26.949" style="s2">feet on ice and then suddenly pull taut</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.469" end="01:10:28.929" style="s2">it was a fine example of this concept of</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.949" end="01:10:30.610" style="s2">normal accident if you do this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.929" end="01:10:31.960" style="s2">stuff sooner or later</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.610" end="01:10:34.090" style="s2">some group of people doing this is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.960" end="01:10:36.460" style="s2">have an accident about it that example</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.090" end="01:10:37.570" style="s2">is well worth careful study by anybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.460" end="01:10:40.090" style="s2">who wants to be able to avoid those</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.570" end="01:10:42.429" style="s2">kinds of situations yeah and the other</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.090" end="01:10:45.790" style="s2">thing Jim that I&#39;m sure you noticed is</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.429" end="01:10:47.469" style="s2">this accident had a way and many of</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.790" end="01:10:49.900" style="s2">these accidents have the same quality</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.469" end="01:10:52.030" style="s2">had a way of sweeping up other elements</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.900" end="01:10:55.170" style="s2">into it that were not connected to it</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.030" end="01:10:57.730" style="s2">initially so the international guard</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.170" end="01:11:02.110" style="s2">mounted a rescue attempt with a</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.730" end="01:11:03.550" style="s2">helicopter a big Blackhawk and went up</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.110" end="01:11:06.550" style="s2">there on the mountain that when they got</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.550" end="01:11:09.850" style="s2">up to the functional limit of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.550" end="01:11:12.159" style="s2">helicopter the helicopter crashed so</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.850" end="01:11:15.280" style="s2">they they now had contributed to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.159" end="01:11:17.980" style="s2">accident more complexity more victims</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.280" end="01:11:20.739" style="s2">more destruction it&#39;s almost as if these</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.980" end="01:11:23.350" style="s2">these events have their own super</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.739" end="01:11:26.830" style="s2">gravity that draws other events into the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.350" end="01:11:28.360" style="s2">into their vortex yeah we had an example</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.830" end="01:11:30.219" style="s2">of that in Santa Fe of several years</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.360" end="01:11:32.469" style="s2">back where some people got lost up on</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.219" end="01:11:35.770" style="s2">the mountains behind Santa Fe and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.469" end="01:11:37.060" style="s2">know snow storms came in and helicopter</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.770" end="01:11:39.820" style="s2">went to rescue him in the helicopter</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.060" end="01:11:43.060" style="s2">crash well and again it was just stupid</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.820" end="01:11:44.380" style="s2">stupid unprepared people luckily they</p>

<p begin="01:12:04.030" end="01:12:08.469" style="s2">well and you were talking earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.770" end="01:12:09.820" style="s2">our American hammock of blood Korea as</p>

<p begin="01:12:24.730" end="01:12:28.840" style="s2">get rewarded every time I look around</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.469" end="01:12:30.310" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the way you train an</p>

<p begin="01:12:30.310" end="01:12:34.090" style="s2">carry a pocket full of treats and pretty</p>

<p begin="01:12:35.380" end="01:12:40.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re kind of like that but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.199" end="01:12:42.460" style="s2">have to do anything to get our rewards</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.000" end="01:12:43.699" style="s2">other than work some cushy job or</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.460" end="01:12:46.520" style="s2">whatever we do</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.699" end="01:12:47.900" style="s2">but we&#39;re constantly being rewarded and</p>

<p begin="01:12:47.900" end="01:12:53.570" style="s2">I&#39;m entertained like I say I must be a</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.260" end="01:12:55.610" style="s2">genius well not quite what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.570" end="01:12:57.860" style="s2">and then you take that attitude into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.610" end="01:13:01.670" style="s2">wilderness and the wilderness does not</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.860" end="01:13:03.290" style="s2">reward you the wilderness says ok now</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.670" end="01:13:05.000" style="s2">you&#39;re on the same term since we were on</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.290" end="01:13:07.969" style="s2">a hundred thousand years ago what are</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.000" end="01:13:13.370" style="s2">you gonna do about it and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.969" end="01:13:16.040" style="s2">first rule is like I say perceive and</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.370" end="01:13:18.620" style="s2">believe yes you really are out in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.040" end="01:13:20.360" style="s2">wilderness and if you misbehave you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.620" end="01:13:24.170" style="s2">gonna get your hand slapped and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.360" end="01:13:25.640" style="s2">worse so it it&#39;s hard to instill roots</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.170" end="01:13:26.780" style="s2">attitude in people who are used to</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.640" end="01:13:29.480" style="s2">looking at the wilderness like a</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.780" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">playground yeah very dangerous very</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.480" end="01:13:33.920" style="s2">dangerous and even people who have great</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:35.330" style="s2">expertise can still get into trouble</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.920" end="01:13:38.690" style="s2">another one of your very well-developed</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.330" end="01:13:41.090" style="s2">stories was that story of Ken Killip and</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.690" end="01:13:43.070" style="s2">his buddy York who set out on the trail</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.090" end="01:13:45.080" style="s2">at Miller pass in Rocky Mountain</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.070" end="01:13:46.610" style="s2">National Park and these were guys who</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.080" end="01:13:49.130" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t expect to get in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.610" end="01:13:52.250" style="s2">but one of them did yeah I mean they</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.130" end="01:13:54.620" style="s2">were experienced hikers backpackers they</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.250" end="01:13:58.580" style="s2">were going to a little group of lakes</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.620" end="01:14:00.710" style="s2">that was down off of the past you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.580" end="01:14:03.440" style="s2">one of the drainages and had it pretty</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.710" end="01:14:04.910" style="s2">well planned I mean they the one guy Ken</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.440" end="01:14:07.520" style="s2">Killip was a firefighter I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.910" end="01:14:09.980" style="s2">remember if York was but they had you</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.520" end="01:14:11.060" style="s2">know basically good skills but emotion</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.980" end="01:14:13.670" style="s2">comes in here</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.060" end="01:14:15.770" style="s2">Killick wasn&#39;t as fast as York York got</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.670" end="01:14:17.239" style="s2">impatient and he said well I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.770" end="01:14:20.270" style="s2">ahead you know you&#39;re too slow I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.239" end="01:14:23.090" style="s2">ahead and I&#39;ll meet you down there this</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.270" end="01:14:26.600" style="s2">is against the rules you do not break up</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.090" end="01:14:28.730" style="s2">the group this is a bad thing making it</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.600" end="01:14:31.130" style="s2">even worse if I remember the details</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.730" end="01:14:34.730" style="s2">correctly Killip had the compass and</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.130" end="01:14:37.670" style="s2">York had that map which is a no-no you</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.730" end="01:14:40.370" style="s2">need both so they did make some key</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.670" end="01:14:42.620" style="s2">mistakes so Killick was was slower than</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.370" end="01:14:46.280" style="s2">he had hoped to be and he was up on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.620" end="01:14:47.929" style="s2">on the ridge when the weather afternoon</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.280" end="01:14:50.060" style="s2">weather came which it often does in that</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.929" end="01:14:52.280" style="s2">part of the country 3 o&#39;clock in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.060" end="01:14:54.980" style="s2">afternoon you get a thunderstorm on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.280" end="01:14:56.850" style="s2">high peaks so he was driven back down</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.980" end="01:14:58.890" style="s2">again to get out of the lightning</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.850" end="01:15:01.560" style="s2">made him even later and then he was</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.890" end="01:15:04.260" style="s2">rushed he was exhausted probably a</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.560" end="01:15:07.200" style="s2">little dehydrated probably a little you</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.260" end="01:15:09.030" style="s2">know confused and pissed off and he</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.200" end="01:15:10.740" style="s2">decided well this is a drainage on going</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.030" end="01:15:12.960" style="s2">down and of course he didn&#39;t have a map</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.740" end="01:15:14.610" style="s2">so he went down the wrong drainage and</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.960" end="01:15:16.590" style="s2">got to the point where he&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.610" end="01:15:18.300" style="s2">see the lakes the lakes weren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.590" end="01:15:18.930" style="s2">and he thought well maybe those lakes</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.300" end="01:15:21.150" style="s2">dried up</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.930" end="01:15:22.740" style="s2">maybe somebody moved the hooks you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.150" end="01:15:24.960" style="s2">you start to think really nutty stuff</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.740" end="01:15:26.970" style="s2">when you get into that that situation</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.960" end="01:15:28.770" style="s2">the last thing in the world you want is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.970" end="01:15:30.990" style="s2">oh my gosh I&#39;ve got to hike back up that</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.770" end="01:15:34.380" style="s2">stupid Ridge and go to the next the next</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.990" end="01:15:36.810" style="s2">drainage over and it&#39;s getting dark and</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.380" end="01:15:39.480" style="s2">so he continued on down the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.810" end="01:15:42.120" style="s2">drainage and was lost for five days and</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.480" end="01:15:45.090" style="s2">did all the things you&#39;re not supposed</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.120" end="01:15:47.880" style="s2">to do when you&#39;re lost he panicked and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.090" end="01:15:50.730" style="s2">started to run around trying to find his</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.880" end="01:15:54.120" style="s2">way back which is classic lost person</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.730" end="01:15:55.950" style="s2">behavior he tried to climb up so that</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.120" end="01:15:58.170" style="s2">he&#39;d get a better view to think you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.950" end="01:16:00.030" style="s2">maybe he could orient himself he climbed</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.170" end="01:16:03.600" style="s2">up and fell and rolled back down this</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.030" end="01:16:06.090" style="s2">this rocky slope and hurt himself he</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.600" end="01:16:08.430" style="s2">passed out when he woke up he was</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.090" end="01:16:11.820" style="s2">covered in snow I mean it just went</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.430" end="01:16:14.490" style="s2">downhill really quickly and somehow</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.820" end="01:16:16.650" style="s2">finally came to his senses he had in his</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.490" end="01:16:19.220" style="s2">pack everything he needed to survive</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.650" end="01:16:22.230" style="s2">right where he was he had sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.220" end="01:16:24.870" style="s2">gear to make a shelter to keep himself</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.230" end="01:16:26.490" style="s2">warm to make a fire and he&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.870" end="01:16:28.440" style="s2">well I&#39;m a firefighter I can&#39;t start a</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.490" end="01:16:31.560" style="s2">fire no no that&#39;s not the right way to</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.440" end="01:16:32.940" style="s2">think because you weren&#39;t sparsit&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.560" end="01:16:35.340" style="s2">supposed to start fires in Rocky</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.940" end="01:16:36.870" style="s2">Mountain National Park at that time but</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.340" end="01:16:39.360" style="s2">he finally came to his senses and</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.870" end="01:16:41.700" style="s2">started a fire and calmed down and did</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.360" end="01:16:44.310" style="s2">all the right things in the end put some</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.700" end="01:16:46.050" style="s2">colored materials out where somebody</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.310" end="01:16:48.870" style="s2">flying over could see it and was finally</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.050" end="01:16:52.020" style="s2">spotted and rescued but it shows you how</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.870" end="01:16:54.690" style="s2">quickly even a smart guy can get stupid</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.020" end="01:16:56.550" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re degrading by physical and</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.690" end="01:16:58.170" style="s2">then you also have quite a little riff</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.550" end="01:17:00.420" style="s2">in that section about the whole nature</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.170" end="01:17:02.070" style="s2">of getting lost and what research has</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.420" end="01:17:04.140" style="s2">told us about that I particularly</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.070" end="01:17:05.400" style="s2">resonate with that cuz I actually there</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.140" end="01:17:07.800" style="s2">was a time and I was a little younger</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.400" end="01:17:10.470" style="s2">and fitter than I am now when I used to</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.800" end="01:17:12.750" style="s2">intentionally enjoy getting lost</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.470" end="01:17:15.300" style="s2">in the woods in a minor kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.750" end="01:17:17.340" style="s2">again I have a farm in the Appalachians</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.300" end="01:17:19.830" style="s2">these are pretty benign mountains you</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.340" end="01:17:23.640" style="s2">know they&#39;re maybe from the farm to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.830" end="01:17:25.380" style="s2">top is maybe six miles in 2,000 feet of</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.640" end="01:17:27.870" style="s2">elevation and it&#39;s you know Eastern</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.380" end="01:17:29.580" style="s2">mountains and I hiked off into areas</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.870" end="01:17:30.900" style="s2">where the logging roads ended and you</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.580" end="01:17:33.300" style="s2">know follow this drainage and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.900" end="01:17:34.170" style="s2">drainage until I didn&#39;t know where I was</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.300" end="01:17:35.910" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.170" end="01:17:38.370" style="s2">yeah and there was a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.910" end="01:17:40.890" style="s2">and powerful feeling that comes upon you</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.370" end="01:17:42.690" style="s2">when you know you&#39;re lost right but</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.890" end="01:17:44.190" style="s2">fortunately I had a heuristic and I</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.690" end="01:17:45.870" style="s2">notice you taught your daughter the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.190" end="01:17:47.730" style="s2">heuristic and I taught my daughter the</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.870" end="01:17:50.970" style="s2">same heuristic when she was about six</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.730" end="01:17:53.310" style="s2">right which is in benign eastern</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.970" end="01:17:56.430" style="s2">mountains I wouldn&#39;t recommend this in</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.310" end="01:17:58.500" style="s2">the Rocky Mountains but in the east 99%</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.430" end="01:18:01.620" style="s2">of the time all you got to do is walk</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.500" end="01:18:03.570" style="s2">downhill until you hit water or a water</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.620" end="01:18:06.120" style="s2">force our area has a lot of harsh</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.570" end="01:18:07.590" style="s2">topography so the streams are off and</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.120" end="01:18:10.230" style="s2">dry in the summer but you come to a</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.590" end="01:18:12.690" style="s2">water force follow the water force and</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.230" end="01:18:15.540" style="s2">within five miles you will cross a road</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.690" end="01:18:17.340" style="s2">yeah and even our most remote roads get</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.540" end="01:18:19.770" style="s2">a car every half hour or so</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.340" end="01:18:21.300" style="s2">so don&#39;t go walking on the road just sit</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.770" end="01:18:23.430" style="s2">by the side of the road till somebody</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.300" end="01:18:25.770" style="s2">comes by yeah and I would actually do</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.430" end="01:18:27.500" style="s2">that and I&#39;d end up in places I go how</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.770" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">the hell you know it&#39;s amazing how</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.500" end="01:18:31.950" style="s2">disoriented your brain is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:34.290" style="s2">truly lost so I really resonated with</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.950" end="01:18:35.760" style="s2">that section on the psyche and even</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.290" end="01:18:36.750" style="s2">though this is baby lost right</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.760" end="01:18:39.060" style="s2">nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.750" end="01:18:41.100" style="s2">it was the real psychological experience</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.060" end="01:18:43.050" style="s2">and so yeah it was really taken with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.100" end="01:18:45.600" style="s2">writing you did in the research that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.050" end="01:18:46.700" style="s2">studied on the nature of being lost and</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.600" end="01:18:49.080" style="s2">you could talk about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.700" end="01:18:51.420" style="s2">so I think I mentioned before that being</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.080" end="01:18:53.760" style="s2">part of the group is extremely important</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.420" end="01:18:56.160" style="s2">to our kinds of creatures you have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.760" end="01:18:58.410" style="s2">stay in the group or or you&#39;ll die</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.160" end="01:19:01.170" style="s2">essentially and when you&#39;re lost you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.410" end="01:19:04.950" style="s2">out of the group and you have some other</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.170" end="01:19:07.320" style="s2">problems in your immediate future you</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.950" end="01:19:09.240" style="s2">know we we learn our own environments</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.320" end="01:19:11.280" style="s2">and we get certain things from them we</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.240" end="01:19:13.290" style="s2">we know our environment because we need</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.280" end="01:19:15.710" style="s2">to get food from it we need to find</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.290" end="01:19:18.360" style="s2">mates and part and be part of the group</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.710" end="01:19:20.820" style="s2">you know we need access to water all</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.360" end="01:19:21.620" style="s2">these things involve knowing where you</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.820" end="01:19:23.300" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.620" end="01:19:26.720" style="s2">and when you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.300" end="01:19:29.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a dire emergency now humans I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.720" end="01:19:31.940" style="s2">are well they may not be unique but</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.360" end="01:19:35.510" style="s2">they&#39;re unusual in that we like to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.940" end="01:19:38.660" style="s2">things to scare ourselves for fun so</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.510" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">things like you know riding a snowmobile</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.660" end="01:19:44.570" style="s2">can be fun because it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:46.460" style="s2">frightening in a controlled way going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.570" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">a horror movie can be fun because we</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.460" end="01:19:51.370" style="s2">know we&#39;re safe so there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.560" end="01:19:55.700" style="s2">things we do that we use this emotional</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.370" end="01:19:57.350" style="s2">elixir that is scaring us in a in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.700" end="01:19:59.240" style="s2">controlled environment so we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.350" end="01:20:01.130" style="s2">safe and we get a big kick out of that</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.240" end="01:20:03.050" style="s2">so it sounds to me like you were doing</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.130" end="01:20:06.800" style="s2">that in the in the situation of getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.050" end="01:20:09.080" style="s2">yourself lost and that it worked but if</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.800" end="01:20:11.390" style="s2">you&#39;re unintentionally lost it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.080" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">different ballgame the typical thing for</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.390" end="01:20:15.550" style="s2">people to do when they&#39;re lost is to</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:19.060" style="s2">panic because it is an emergency and</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.550" end="01:20:22.970" style="s2">it&#39;s much more of an emergency for</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.060" end="01:20:25.400" style="s2">people who are like in their teens so</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.970" end="01:20:28.370" style="s2">interestingly enough if a little kid</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.400" end="01:20:32.690" style="s2">gets lost the little kid survives better</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.370" end="01:20:35.080" style="s2">than you know a 14 year old the 14 year</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.690" end="01:20:37.900" style="s2">old is probably the worst of all</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.080" end="01:20:40.870" style="s2">survivors in a situation of being lost</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.900" end="01:20:43.880" style="s2">older people tend to do better too</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.870" end="01:20:46.820" style="s2">because they can stay calmer the little</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.880" end="01:20:48.530" style="s2">kids do well being lost because they</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.820" end="01:20:51.710" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re lost they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.530" end="01:20:53.870" style="s2">yet developed a sense of of lost and in</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.710" end="01:20:55.940" style="s2">fact if that little kid gets lost in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.870" end="01:20:58.070" style="s2">grocery store and somebody says where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.940" end="01:21:01.040" style="s2">your mommy the kid will say my mommy is</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.070" end="01:21:03.230" style="s2">lost so hey I&#39;m not lost I know where I</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.040" end="01:21:05.360" style="s2">am I&#39;m right here and so the little kids</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.230" end="01:21:07.460" style="s2">don&#39;t panic and they do things that are</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.360" end="01:21:09.920" style="s2">natural if they&#39;re thirsty they&#39;ll drink</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.460" end="01:21:12.530" style="s2">from a puddle if they&#39;re cold they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.920" end="01:21:14.210" style="s2">get into a hollow log so they do these</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.530" end="01:21:17.630" style="s2">natural survival things without even</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.210" end="01:21:19.820" style="s2">thinking a teenager who has not yet</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.630" end="01:21:22.520" style="s2">developed cognitive control of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.820" end="01:21:24.350" style="s2">emotions will realize he&#39;s lost because</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.520" end="01:21:27.950" style="s2">he&#39;s got that skill of knowing where he</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.350" end="01:21:29.660" style="s2">is and he will panic and he will run and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.950" end="01:21:32.770" style="s2">often these teenagers run themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.660" end="01:21:36.340" style="s2">death I have a good friend who who</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.770" end="01:21:38.670" style="s2">happened to in in Utah his son died</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.340" end="01:21:40.750" style="s2">because he got separated from the group</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.670" end="01:21:43.450" style="s2">accidentally and and he just took off</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.750" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">running and in many cases these</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.450" end="01:21:47.470" style="s2">teenagers will run right through</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:49.450" style="s2">somebody&#39;s front yard not realized that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.470" end="01:21:50.140" style="s2">they&#39;ve been you know that they are not</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.450" end="01:21:52.540" style="s2">lost anymore</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.140" end="01:21:56.290" style="s2">and so being lost with a much more</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.540" end="01:21:58.420" style="s2">complex phenomenon them than we see at</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.290" end="01:22:00.670" style="s2">first sight and so that&#39;s why I devote</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.420" end="01:22:03.940" style="s2">so much time to it in deep survival I</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.670" end="01:22:06.580" style="s2">believe we can get lost in other ways in</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.940" end="01:22:09.520" style="s2">our lives we can get lost in business we</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.580" end="01:22:12.370" style="s2">can certainly get lost in love and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.520" end="01:22:14.860" style="s2">worth thinking about it was a very good</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.370" end="01:22:16.870" style="s2">section it really resonated with me and</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.860" end="01:22:18.610" style="s2">I took some lessons away from it and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.870" end="01:22:20.500" style="s2">would really recommend that section for</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.610" end="01:22:21.670" style="s2">people want to read the book let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.500" end="01:22:23.890" style="s2">along we&#39;re getting a little close to</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.670" end="01:22:26.740" style="s2">our time here we talked about optimism</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.890" end="01:22:28.600" style="s2">before there was a very interesting riff</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.740" end="01:22:31.390" style="s2">in the book about positive mental</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.600" end="01:22:33.880" style="s2">attitude which was the watchword of</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.390" end="01:22:36.040" style="s2">byron Kearns who you had experience with</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.880" end="01:22:37.840" style="s2">at his Mountain Shepherd survival school</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.040" end="01:22:40.720" style="s2">can you talk to us about that a little</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.840" end="01:22:44.920" style="s2">bit yeah and this is hand-in-hand with</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.720" end="01:22:48.070" style="s2">humor hand-in-hand with optimism and</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.920" end="01:22:51.250" style="s2">hand-in-hand with be cool if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.070" end="01:22:53.650" style="s2">doing all of these things you are well</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.250" end="01:22:56.260" style="s2">along the road to having what is called</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.650" end="01:22:58.090" style="s2">positive mental attitude which is a term</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.260" end="01:23:00.640" style="s2">the military uses a lot by the way and</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.090" end="01:23:03.550" style="s2">byron Kearns was an Air Force survival</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.640" end="01:23:06.610" style="s2">school guy so I&#39;m sure he picked it up</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.550" end="01:23:10.420" style="s2">from them and that that is really at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.610" end="01:23:12.190" style="s2">core of of survival I mean anybody can</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.420" end="01:23:14.830" style="s2">get the equipment you need to survive</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.190" end="01:23:18.100" style="s2">and in fact if you develop the skills</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.830" end="01:23:20.770" style="s2">you can create this equipment in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.100" end="01:23:22.450" style="s2">wild I took another survival course</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.770" end="01:23:24.880" style="s2">which was called a primitive survival</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.450" end="01:23:26.620" style="s2">course in which they basically toss you</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.880" end="01:23:29.110" style="s2">into the woods with nothing and you have</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.620" end="01:23:31.570" style="s2">to start from scratch and and build your</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.110" end="01:23:34.540" style="s2">kit out of what you have in front of you</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.570" end="01:23:36.000" style="s2">which is all the tools that mankind had</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.540" end="01:23:38.520" style="s2">you know a hundred thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.000" end="01:23:41.110" style="s2">but with his positive mental attitude</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.520" end="01:23:44.850" style="s2">that includes all these elements of</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.110" end="01:23:48.330" style="s2">humor optimism being cool</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.850" end="01:23:49.920" style="s2">you will function so much better I mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.330" end="01:23:54.300" style="s2">right now in the midst of the</p>

<p begin="01:24:33.630" end="01:24:37.800" style="s2">because these things are not voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.090" end="01:24:39.660" style="s2">these survival situations sir</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.800" end="01:24:42.500" style="s2">you don&#39;t sign up for them voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.660" end="01:24:45.510" style="s2">when they come upon you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.500" end="01:24:48.480" style="s2">perceive and believe man it&#39;s here it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:24:48.480" end="01:24:52.920" style="s2">stuff and I love that section of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.640" end="01:24:55.380" style="s2">book the other survival school you went</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.920" end="01:24:57.450" style="s2">to was Mark Morley&#39;s Vermont wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.380" end="01:24:59.220" style="s2">survival school in Brattleboro that was</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.450" end="01:25:01.920" style="s2">a very different experience could you</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.220" end="01:25:04.500" style="s2">briefly tell us about that so if the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.920" end="01:25:06.390" style="s2">primitive survival school you&#39;re assumed</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.500" end="01:25:07.350" style="s2">to have nothing you&#39;re you&#39;re dropped in</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.390" end="01:25:10.290" style="s2">the middle of the woods with nothing</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.350" end="01:25:13.130" style="s2">what are you gonna do and so they</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.290" end="01:25:16.790" style="s2">develop such skills as I made fire</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.130" end="01:25:19.320" style="s2">without any conventional fire making</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.790" end="01:25:20.760" style="s2">materials and I described this in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.320" end="01:25:21.090" style="s2">book it took me a couple of days to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.760" end="01:25:23.570" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.090" end="01:25:26.570" style="s2">first you break a rock to make a knife</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.570" end="01:25:29.910" style="s2">then you use the knife to cut a branch</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.570" end="01:25:32.220" style="s2">then you skin the branch to get the bark</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.910" end="01:25:35.370" style="s2">and you have to know the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.220" end="01:25:37.650" style="s2">bark you want and then you untwist the</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.370" end="01:25:40.830" style="s2">fibers of the bark to make a rope and</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.650" end="01:25:44.250" style="s2">you take a suitable branch that you use</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.830" end="01:25:46.680" style="s2">as a bow and you tie it with the rope to</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.250" end="01:25:48.750" style="s2">make the bowstring and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.680" end="01:25:51.060" style="s2">another piece of wood that goes twisted</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.750" end="01:25:53.190" style="s2">into the bowstring to make a spindle and</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.060" end="01:25:56.490" style="s2">as you move the bow back and forth the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.190" end="01:25:58.680" style="s2">spindle spins and you have a piece of</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.490" end="01:26:00.540" style="s2">wood at the bottom that it spins against</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.680" end="01:26:01.740" style="s2">and as you spin the wood the piece at</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.540" end="01:26:04.650" style="s2">the bottom gets hotter and hotter until</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.740" end="01:26:06.660" style="s2">you get a glowing Ember and prior to all</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.650" end="01:26:09.450" style="s2">this you&#39;ve made a fire bundle which is</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.660" end="01:26:12.990" style="s2">tinder which is some kind of dry leafy</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.450" end="01:26:14.580" style="s2">material and you put the little ember</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.990" end="01:26:15.540" style="s2">into the material and blow on it and it</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.580" end="01:26:18.780" style="s2">bursts into flames</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.540" end="01:26:21.830" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to do but you can</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.780" end="01:26:24.090" style="s2">learn to do it and so he&#39;s teaching you</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.830" end="01:26:26.700" style="s2">you know what if you don&#39;t have anything</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.090" end="01:26:29.280" style="s2">what if what if mr. York did walk away</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.700" end="01:26:31.770" style="s2">with the map he did another thing which</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.280" end="01:26:33.420" style="s2">means with me which was fascinating and</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.770" end="01:26:35.940" style="s2">I describe it in deep survival and</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.420" end="01:26:39.270" style="s2">that&#39;s how to do tracking without a</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.940" end="01:26:42.810" style="s2">compass and he did it by noticing signs</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.270" end="01:26:44.790" style="s2">in nature that were unique and he would</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.810" end="01:26:47.310" style="s2">point them out and we&#39;d stop and talk</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.790" end="01:26:49.970" style="s2">about them and we&#39;d look ahead and find</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.310" end="01:26:52.830" style="s2">another such thing in the distance and</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.970" end="01:26:56.280" style="s2">we&#39;d stop and talk about that and we</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.830" end="01:26:58.710" style="s2">would go from point to point with these</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.280" end="01:27:02.790" style="s2">unique features like a particular knot</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.710" end="01:27:04.530" style="s2">in a tree deer tracks in the mud just</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.790" end="01:27:06.780" style="s2">different things a patch of mushrooms</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.530" end="01:27:08.970" style="s2">and it would create a little stepping</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.780" end="01:27:10.410" style="s2">stone for us to where we got all the way</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.970" end="01:27:12.180" style="s2">into the woods and then could follow</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.410" end="01:27:15.270" style="s2">these stepping stones back out without</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.180" end="01:27:18.060" style="s2">any map no compass and we never got lost</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.270" end="01:27:20.070" style="s2">that way so it&#39;s fascinating school and</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.060" end="01:27:23.430" style="s2">he taught a lot of little kids I watched</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.070" end="01:27:26.100" style="s2">a nine-year-old kid make a fire in about</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.430" end="01:27:28.410" style="s2">90 seconds with a hand drill that is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.100" end="01:27:30.960" style="s2">stick held between his two palms that he</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.410" end="01:27:33.210" style="s2">rubbed back and forth to spin and into</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.960" end="01:27:35.430" style="s2">another board and it&#39;s in about 90</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.210" end="01:27:36.930" style="s2">seconds to make a fire was like whoa how</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.430" end="01:27:40.530" style="s2">long did it take you to learn that he</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.930" end="01:27:42.750" style="s2">said well about two years Wow Wow</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.530" end="01:27:44.430" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful it&#39;s wonderful stuff I</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.750" end="01:27:46.910" style="s2">encourage people to take survival</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.430" end="01:27:49.880" style="s2">training it&#39;s it&#39;s lovely just for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.910" end="01:27:52.020" style="s2">mental advantage it gives you in life</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.880" end="01:27:54.510" style="s2">yeah that was my takeaway and I was</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.020" end="01:27:56.760" style="s2">gonna ask you in this soft world of ours</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.510" end="01:27:58.800" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we consider making survival</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.760" end="01:28:00.180" style="s2">training part of everybody&#39;s education</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.800" end="01:28:02.520" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.180" end="01:28:04.860" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be smart to do that as part</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.520" end="01:28:06.480" style="s2">of high school right yeah or even junior</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.860" end="01:28:09.060" style="s2">high school you don&#39;t have to be any</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.480" end="01:28:10.140" style="s2">more than 12 or 13 there or even less</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.060" end="01:28:11.310" style="s2">than that yeah I remember in the Boy</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.140" end="01:28:13.620" style="s2">Scouts we did a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.310" end="01:28:16.020" style="s2">edgy stuff and I think we just make</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.620" end="01:28:18.420" style="s2">people stronger mentally and more</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.020" end="01:28:21.930" style="s2">resilient emotionally if they had</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.420" end="01:28:24.120" style="s2">survival training I started my son my</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.930" end="01:28:29.310" style="s2">son Jonas is 17 he&#39;s a junior in high</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.120" end="01:28:33.120" style="s2">school I started him he was probably 5 I</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.310" end="01:28:36.270" style="s2">would imagine with little things like</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.120" end="01:28:38.550" style="s2">fire making and you know how to use a</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.270" end="01:28:40.680" style="s2">knife how to hold a knife safely you</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.550" end="01:28:43.110" style="s2">know making a shelter for example you</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.680" end="01:28:44.910" style="s2">can if you&#39;re dropped make it into the</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.110" end="01:28:48.930" style="s2">woods you can survive a blizzard by</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.910" end="01:28:52.890" style="s2">making a debris shelter in the forest so</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.930" end="01:28:55.040" style="s2">a trick like that could have potentially</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.890" end="01:28:58.080" style="s2">saved those two guys on Mount Washington</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.040" end="01:29:00.510" style="s2">because you can go in a debris shelter</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.080" end="01:29:03.030" style="s2">that&#39;s made correctly you can have 20</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.510" end="01:29:05.300" style="s2">below outside and be toasty warm so</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.030" end="01:29:07.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.300" end="01:29:09.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t even have to use these in life</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.740" end="01:29:13.200" style="s2">just to give yourself a mental edge</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.890" end="01:29:15.270" style="s2">that&#39;s what I took away like you I was a</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.200" end="01:29:17.580" style="s2">you know a baby boomer and we were just</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.270" end="01:29:20.010" style="s2">let run free as kids and we do stuff we</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.580" end="01:29:21.390" style="s2">build forts out of logs and we did this</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.010" end="01:29:23.610" style="s2">and we did that we weren&#39;t over</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.390" end="01:29:26.310" style="s2">scheduled and over committed to lessons</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.610" end="01:29:28.140" style="s2">and all that kind of stuff and seems to</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.310" end="01:29:30.510" style="s2">me that with the lack of that today</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.140" end="01:29:32.660" style="s2">perhaps survival training is a way to</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.510" end="01:29:35.580" style="s2">get back to that kind of emotional</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.660" end="01:29:37.740" style="s2">self-sufficiency that I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.580" end="01:29:40.020" style="s2">us people who were raised more as free</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.740" end="01:29:41.970" style="s2">running children had yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.020" end="01:29:43.890" style="s2">completely well we&#39;re kind of getting</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.970" end="01:29:46.530" style="s2">close to the time here so I&#39;m gonna skip</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.890" end="01:29:48.570" style="s2">over three really interesting episodes</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.530" end="01:29:50.460" style="s2">of adventure and survival so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.570" end="01:29:52.380" style="s2">going to call out for the people who</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.460" end="01:29:54.540" style="s2">read the book and people do read this</p>

<p begin="01:30:12.210" end="01:30:19.110" style="s2">I think we&#39;re gonna wrap up with a brief</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.480" end="01:30:21.960" style="s2">discussion of your other book surviving</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.110" end="01:30:24.719" style="s2">survival surviving an extreme event is a</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.960" end="01:30:26.610" style="s2">traumatic event in itself and a person</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.719" end="01:30:29.190" style="s2">to come back from that could you tell us</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.610" end="01:30:32.820" style="s2">at least a little bit about what it</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.190" end="01:30:35.940" style="s2">means to survive survival yes so when I</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.820" end="01:30:38.309" style="s2">wrote deep survival I was thinking in</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.940" end="01:30:40.769" style="s2">terms of you know once you&#39;re rescued</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.309" end="01:30:42.599" style="s2">the the event is over right or once you</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.769" end="01:30:45.019" style="s2">self rescue the event is over you go</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.599" end="01:30:48.719" style="s2">back to life you tell your friends it&#39;s</p>
