<p begin="00:01:17.159" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">activity so it ended up over the years</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.150" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">building out quite a network of folks</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:32.329" style="s2">and I was finding that I spent I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">spending too much of my time just</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.930" end="00:06:15.220" style="s2">the the big conundrum that that Weaver&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.060" end="00:06:18.070" style="s2">like us tend to have that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.220" end="00:06:20.260" style="s2">constantly like trying to stay in touch</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.070" end="00:06:22.510" style="s2">with such a broad network and wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.260" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing more joyful than</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.510" end="00:06:27.610" style="s2">connecting to people that need to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:31.090" style="s2">work together and can do stuff that no</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.610" end="00:06:33.100" style="s2">one of them could do alone and but at</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.090" end="00:06:36.010" style="s2">the same time it gets a bit tedious when</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.100" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">when you find that half of your week&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.010" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">work or more is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:46.699" style="s2">that and somehow there&#39;s more no</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:51.319" style="s2">financial flux into supporting yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.699" end="00:06:54.500" style="s2">can be tough time quite easily yeah no</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.289" end="00:07:06.949" style="s2">proposition that this whole network now</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.830" end="00:09:36.120" style="s2">was talking to Joe about last year and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.899" end="00:09:42.029" style="s2">then we kind of reconnected again just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.120" end="00:09:45.480" style="s2">few about a month ago actually so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.029" end="00:09:47.880" style="s2">now joined GRC and you know I just see</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.480" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">you know this is why the word collab is</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.880" end="00:09:53.580" style="s2">in there right I just see all of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:58.040" style="s2">things as being interrelate you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.580" end="00:10:00.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a network of people doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.040" end="00:10:03.660" style="s2">initiatives and the more you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.380" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">interconnect that network at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.660" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2">the day the you know you know pretty in</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:15.779" style="s2">an action-oriented fashion the more good</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:17.820" style="s2">stuff will happen if I could have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.779" end="00:10:19.890" style="s2">entity that didn&#39;t have a name I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.820" end="00:10:22.020" style="s2">probably have an entity they could</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.890" end="00:10:24.300" style="s2">another name because it&#39;s really about</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.020" end="00:10:28.070" style="s2">all the great work but everybody else is</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.300" end="00:10:28.070" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to move forward right</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.000" end="00:10:34.500" style="s2">when we that the last times we spoke you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.040" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">were also very active in the space of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.500" end="00:10:42.690" style="s2">trying to get people and together that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">we&#39;re all trying to find new vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.690" end="00:10:48.810" style="s2">for investment or bringing finance to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:50.899" style="s2">large landscape restoration like</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.810" end="00:10:53.339" style="s2">large-scale ecosystems restoration and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.899" end="00:10:57.029" style="s2">regenerative activity in that space and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.339" end="00:10:58.330" style="s2">um is that somehow still linked with</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.029" end="00:11:01.510" style="s2">that same</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.330" end="00:11:02.890" style="s2">cool app initiative and and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.510" end="00:11:06.180" style="s2">was asking also about Joe because Joe</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.890" end="00:11:08.800" style="s2">seems to be building some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.180" end="00:11:11.050" style="s2">investment platform for regeneration and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:20.830" style="s2">I was wondering whether they are somehow</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.050" end="00:11:23.880" style="s2">linked um so yeah you know finances is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.830" end="00:11:27.810" style="s2">big big challenge within these things</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.880" end="00:11:30.970" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve got a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.810" end="00:11:32.260" style="s2">interesting in the way I yeah got a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.970" end="00:11:36.010" style="s2">whole bunch of interesting finance</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.260" end="00:11:39.370" style="s2">people in the network who are working on</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.010" end="00:11:43.240" style="s2">a whole body you know quite quite a wide</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.370" end="00:11:45.540" style="s2">range of different initiatives to try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.240" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">figure out how to move more capital into</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.540" end="00:11:51.100" style="s2">in an appropriate Roger in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:54.760" style="s2">regenerative fashion right it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.100" end="00:11:56.740" style="s2">regenerative activity yeah cuz you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.760" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">the the standard relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.740" end="00:12:02.620" style="s2">capital as we as we all know can be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:07.720" style="s2">bit extract him so there&#39;s a need for</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.620" end="00:12:09.820" style="s2">all sorts of transformation to occur to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.720" end="00:12:14.770" style="s2">set that up well so it&#39;s definitely one</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.820" end="00:12:16.990" style="s2">of the core areas of inquiry and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.770" end="00:12:20.050" style="s2">in that context yeah Joe&#39;s current</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.990" end="00:12:22.570" style="s2">initiative around this funds that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.050" end="00:12:26.410" style="s2">trying to set up nobody is in process of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.570" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">setting up and focused well he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.410" end="00:12:31.390" style="s2">talking about I mean he&#39;s in Colombia</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:33.190" style="s2">currently but I&#39;m not sure whether he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.390" end="00:12:36.940" style="s2">thinking about it just to know fully in</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.190" end="00:12:38.620" style="s2">the context of Colombia or more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.940" end="00:12:41.130" style="s2">you know like it like most of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.620" end="00:12:45.520" style="s2">early-stage ideas right it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.130" end="00:12:48.640" style="s2">evolutionary process of you put a thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.520" end="00:12:50.950" style="s2">out there start to get people talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.640" end="00:12:54.310" style="s2">about it you engage people and then what</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.950" end="00:12:56.200" style="s2">becomes possible you know you start to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.310" end="00:12:59.350" style="s2">see possibilities that you didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.200" end="00:13:02.589" style="s2">before um so I think you he&#39;s somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.350" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">in that rapid developmental cycle right</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.589" end="00:13:09.310" style="s2">now around oh yeah this question of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:10.230" style="s2">unlocking I mean both filling you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.310" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">philanthropic</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.230" end="00:13:16.890" style="s2">and other types of capital to enable ya</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.860" style="s2">regenerative activity especially the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.890" end="00:13:22.230" style="s2">convening piece right beep well at least</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.860" end="00:13:26.510" style="s2">what are one of the key areas that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.230" end="00:13:31.500" style="s2">about to try and unlock under the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.510" end="00:13:33.000" style="s2">community around is this question of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.500" end="00:13:35.880" style="s2">do you support you know what&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.000" end="00:13:37.590" style="s2">business model how do you support this</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.880" end="00:13:41.640" style="s2">Earl you know people who are bringing</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.590" end="00:13:45.390" style="s2">together the regional networks in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.640" end="00:13:48.960" style="s2">early stage before bears for generate</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.390" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">the projects and the opportunities where</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.960" end="00:13:54.450" style="s2">you need blended finance come in but</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:57.720" style="s2">that early stage is really hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.450" end="00:13:59.340" style="s2">funded ripped yes but but it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.720" end="00:14:03.750" style="s2">interesting because like if you take for</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.340" end="00:14:05.370" style="s2">example the the project that that I sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.750" end="00:14:07.530" style="s2">of move you in with and that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.370" end="00:14:11.000" style="s2">probably know in touch with more than I</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.530" end="00:14:15.000" style="s2">am and the regenerating Network you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.000" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">that kind of initially was was basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.000" end="00:14:18.030" style="s2">an idea that grew out of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:20.190" style="s2">dissatisfaction with not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.030" end="00:14:23.160" style="s2">give all the amazing runner-ups on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.190" end="00:14:24.900" style="s2">last spring price some prizes because</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.160" end="00:14:26.760" style="s2">they all deserved money to run their</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.900" end="00:14:28.590" style="s2">amazing regenerative projects all over</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.760" end="00:14:31.740" style="s2">the world both social and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.590" end="00:14:34.290" style="s2">regeneration and that&#39;s when when back</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.740" end="00:14:36.540" style="s2">then I first thought wait a minute the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.290" end="00:14:37.980" style="s2">same situation must be the case for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.540" end="00:14:39.780" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller challenge I also</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.980" end="00:14:43.140" style="s2">thought about the biomimicry design</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.780" end="00:14:49.110" style="s2">challenge and a number of other em of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.140" end="00:14:52.530" style="s2">these beautiful kind of prize-winning</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.110" end="00:14:55.050" style="s2">challenges but but then in talking with</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.530" end="00:14:57.300" style="s2">with David Mocambo we we very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.050" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">got to this like could they be</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.300" end="00:15:01.020" style="s2">redesigned in such a way that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:03.480" style="s2">not zero-sum games that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.020" end="00:15:05.460" style="s2">about winners and losers and how would</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.480" end="00:15:09.330" style="s2">you do that that that was my initial</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.460" end="00:15:11.100" style="s2">kind of starting point for helping to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.330" end="00:15:15.030" style="s2">launch that conversation and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.100" end="00:15:17.610" style="s2">of a both and while it still has this</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.030" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">vision of showcasing amazing</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.610" end="00:15:22.230" style="s2">regenerative projects that have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:23.939" style="s2">vetted through both the either the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.230" end="00:15:27.209" style="s2">spring prize or the buttons</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.939" end="00:15:28.559" style="s2">for a challenge initially em showcasing</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.209" end="00:15:30.059" style="s2">them to the world showcasing them to</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.559" end="00:15:32.189" style="s2">each other showing that the movement is</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.059" end="00:15:35.129" style="s2">much larger than we all thought is even</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.189" end="00:15:37.409" style="s2">possible and also showcasing them to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.129" end="00:15:39.720" style="s2">anybody who wants to learn either from</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.409" end="00:15:44.489" style="s2">those projects but also wants to support</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.720" end="00:15:47.129" style="s2">them and um that part I really like but</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.489" end="00:15:48.839" style="s2">then when we when we kind of started</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.129" end="00:15:51.629" style="s2">talking more in the in the California</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.839" end="00:15:55.559" style="s2">environment it very quickly brought in</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.629" end="00:15:58.049" style="s2">these other types of impact investment</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.559" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">and other monies and I ever since then</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.049" end="00:16:03.239" style="s2">it&#39;s just a feeling of mine that I felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:07.619" style="s2">that that the initial power of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.239" end="00:16:11.849" style="s2">project of really showcasing vetted on</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.619" end="00:16:14.220" style="s2">the ground place sensitive place sourced</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.849" end="00:16:16.829" style="s2">initiatives not initiatives that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.220" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">this is where well I wanna challenge you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.829" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">just for a mutual learning this idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:27.419" style="s2">that you can have 250 people who are all</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:32.309" style="s2">committed mean well no shit lots of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.419" end="00:16:34.949" style="s2">stuff sort of come in as the expert team</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.309" end="00:16:37.769" style="s2">to a specific location and a specific</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.949" end="00:16:40.049" style="s2">problem that is really about that bio</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.769" end="00:16:42.659" style="s2">cultural uniqueness of that bio region</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.049" end="00:16:45.359" style="s2">in that particular place and that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.659" end="00:16:48.659" style="s2">can generate a hell of a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.359" end="00:16:53.539" style="s2">useful stuff in a bunch of hackathons</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.659" end="00:16:53.539" style="s2">online or even in place</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.100" end="00:16:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a both and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.050" end="00:16:59.950" style="s2">that they wouldn&#39;t generate a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.760" end="00:17:06.220" style="s2">really useful stuff but like big</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.950" end="00:17:11.110" style="s2">question with it is if really arean</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.220" end="00:17:14.380" style="s2">habit in place and redesigning the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.110" end="00:17:17.350" style="s2">impact on place and planet from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.380" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">ground up core creatively is so much</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.350" end="00:17:22.390" style="s2">about being placed sourced and sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:25.470" style="s2">to the local ecosystem how big is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.390" end="00:17:35.260" style="s2">role of the external expert in in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.470" end="00:17:41.550" style="s2">do you see what I&#39;m getting in yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.260" end="00:17:41.550" style="s2">I mean I so I think it goes to your</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.030" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">other people use the word local too</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.310" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">right but I think it goes to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.620" end="00:17:56.560" style="s2">concept of local where these you know a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.420" end="00:17:58.210" style="s2">regional thing you know right now most</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.560" end="00:18:01.810" style="s2">of our attention is focused at this</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.210" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">macro or you know globalization right</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.810" end="00:18:07.030" style="s2">and especially financial globalization</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:10.810" style="s2">is this giant abstraction floating in</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.030" end="00:18:15.010" style="s2">the clouds that is not embedded in place</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.810" end="00:18:19.540" style="s2">at all and so it engages with place in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.010" end="00:18:23.290" style="s2">way that is very incent is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.540" end="00:18:27.580" style="s2">insensitive to the to the bio you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.290" end="00:18:30.340" style="s2">so all sorts of things locally</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.580" end="00:18:33.490" style="s2">regionally and globally making you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.340" end="00:18:37.780" style="s2">it&#39;s just detached from reality at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.490" end="00:18:41.290" style="s2">certain level so I absolutely agree that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.780" end="00:18:45.580" style="s2">we you know the the the new pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.290" end="00:18:48.940" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at is strongly placed</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.580" end="00:18:51.940" style="s2">based is strongly placed sourced was</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.940" end="00:18:55.150" style="s2">that the phrase use something and where</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.940" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">it is people in them you know a network</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.150" end="00:19:01.030" style="s2">a community of people in that place with</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:04.930" style="s2">or time with self-determination going</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.030" end="00:19:05.890" style="s2">here&#39;s what needs to be you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.930" end="00:19:09.910" style="s2">what we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.890" end="00:19:13.240" style="s2">as the inhabitants of this place is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.910" end="00:19:17.970" style="s2">right thing to be doing it will still be</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.240" end="00:19:17.970" style="s2">embedded in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.080" end="00:19:27.030" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s we did each one of those nodes</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.130" end="00:19:29.460" style="s2">and activity places nodes of activity</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.030" end="00:19:31.770" style="s2">each one of those places is still part</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.460" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">of a larger system going to be prop a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.770" end="00:19:39.930" style="s2">larger system at least is if my is what</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:43.710" style="s2">I would posit I don&#39;t think we want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.930" end="00:19:45.960" style="s2">entirely have those things divorced from</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.710" end="00:19:49.950" style="s2">having any kind of interconnectivity</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.960" end="00:19:53.550" style="s2">really completing what you know what and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.950" end="00:19:57.090" style="s2">what I would say is that and often in</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.550" end="00:19:59.130" style="s2">some of those places that kind of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.090" end="00:20:01.950" style="s2">there are pockets of expertise that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.130" end="00:20:04.980" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily present in many of</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.950" end="00:20:08.100" style="s2">those places that allow you know whether</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.980" end="00:20:10.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a certain kind of yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.100" end="00:20:12.450" style="s2">where I find that that this logically</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.380" end="00:20:13.800" style="s2">this makes perfect sense to me and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:18.300" style="s2">is where I find the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.800" end="00:20:20.190" style="s2">sometimes with people who I like in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.300" end="00:20:22.230" style="s2">visioning stage if we want to bring us</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.190" end="00:20:24.500" style="s2">bring a local network together and work</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.230" end="00:20:26.520" style="s2">with this entire region to become</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.500" end="00:20:28.050" style="s2">regenerative and we&#39;ve got a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.520" end="00:20:29.670" style="s2">team of people that are very committed</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.050" end="00:20:33.870" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna make this the region</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.670" end="00:20:36.870" style="s2">region yeah and it&#39;s great and that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.870" end="00:20:39.540" style="s2">I just feel like from my experience of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.870" end="00:20:41.070" style="s2">having seen this first move out from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.540" end="00:20:42.810" style="s2">little nucleus that was the finding on</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.070" end="00:20:45.930" style="s2">eco village and trying to work with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.810" end="00:20:47.640" style="s2">Moorish iron region more and in undo</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.930" end="00:20:49.680" style="s2">some of that bubble effect that happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.640" end="00:20:51.690" style="s2">when when the Eco village was was first</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.680" end="00:20:53.720" style="s2">formed and really start it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.690" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">called the building bridges program and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.720" end="00:20:59.490" style="s2">working with the local communities and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:01.770" style="s2">the local government and so on like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.490" end="00:21:05.010" style="s2">brought when I worked for friend on</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.770" end="00:21:07.050" style="s2">college it was the regional government</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.010" end="00:21:08.910" style="s2">that funded my job and that was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.050" end="00:21:10.470" style="s2">of precedent for how the community</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.910" end="00:21:13.230" style="s2">started to work with the regional</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.470" end="00:21:16.920" style="s2">funding bodies in the same here on</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.230" end="00:21:19.530" style="s2">Majorca like coming down starting with</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.920" end="00:21:23.640" style="s2">education doing a Eco village design</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.530" end="00:21:26.550" style="s2">education program in 2011 that really</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.640" end="00:21:28.860" style="s2">build community here um but then the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.550" end="00:21:32.700" style="s2">crisis that started in 2008 it really</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.860" end="00:21:35.910" style="s2">hit Spain in 2011 12 badly and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.700" end="00:21:37.800" style="s2">and and so that kind of fidget that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.910" end="00:21:39.720" style="s2">initial community a little bit but lots</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.800" end="00:21:43.230" style="s2">of really cool project started and so on</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.720" end="00:21:45.630" style="s2">but what I&#39;m getting it is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.230" end="00:21:48.570" style="s2">slowly trying to do this work and when</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.630" end="00:21:50.790" style="s2">it gets down through the real cultural</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.570" end="00:21:53.700" style="s2">identity of a place then just for my</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.790" end="00:21:59.070" style="s2">personal experience and that&#39;s when sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.700" end="00:22:00.990" style="s2">of responding from and things like like</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.070" end="00:22:02.910" style="s2">I remember when somebody told me in two</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.990" end="00:22:05.640" style="s2">years into being on my yogurt and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.910" end="00:22:08.040" style="s2">Majorca told me don&#39;t be quite so</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.640" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">visionary this can all be done and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.040" end="00:22:11.940" style="s2">do it now and waiting your arms around</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:14.280" style="s2">because it just doesn&#39;t matter with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.940" end="00:22:15.870" style="s2">local culture very well yeah you you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.280" end="00:22:20.990" style="s2">just stick you laid too much I still do</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.870" end="00:22:23.640" style="s2">that and and any and you also said to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:26.580" style="s2">don&#39;t burn out because I would love your</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.640" end="00:22:28.650" style="s2">impulses to to be to ground on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.580" end="00:22:31.590" style="s2">island but you have to actually think of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.650" end="00:22:33.900" style="s2">it but most of the people here if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.590" end="00:22:36.360" style="s2">still here in ten years time they will</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.900" end="00:22:38.520" style="s2">start to listen to you and what you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.360" end="00:22:41.070" style="s2">in between is just as important that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.520" end="00:22:42.930" style="s2">don&#39;t burn out in the process then that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.070" end="00:22:45.030" style="s2">you do a few things that establish you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.930" end="00:22:48.540" style="s2">as somebody who&#39;s committed to wanting</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.030" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">to contribute and serve a larger whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.540" end="00:22:55.350" style="s2">and that was best piece of advice I ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:57.920" style="s2">got her um in terms of working locally</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.350" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t walk around and spout big</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.920" end="00:23:03.690" style="s2">sort of I am regenerating my Orca blah</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:08.220" style="s2">blah blah because it&#39;s a very slow</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.690" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">process huh it&#39;s it&#39;s a and and the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.220" end="00:23:14.130" style="s2">you communicate it the more danger you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.580" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">actually create of it backfiring on you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:18.390" style="s2">because you actually would be nurturing</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:20.430" style="s2">and doing social acupuncture and weaving</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.390" end="00:23:22.230" style="s2">connections and like for example that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.430" end="00:23:25.020" style="s2">the stuff that I did with with eco we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.230" end="00:23:27.900" style="s2">bringing eco veil on Majorca to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.020" end="00:23:33.060" style="s2">experiment with a regional biomaterials</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.900" end="00:23:35.430" style="s2">economy yeah and we never went into mass</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.060" end="00:23:36.990" style="s2">production of floor cleaner or hand soap</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.430" end="00:23:39.150" style="s2">or any of the products we were playing</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.990" end="00:23:41.550" style="s2">around with but we pulled together a</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.090" end="00:25:17.670" style="s2">was here and it generated a buzz and a</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.670" end="00:25:22.140" style="s2">that really regenerate a region these</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.010" end="00:25:25.640" style="s2">kind of bringing in the expert teams in</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.140" end="00:25:29.190" style="s2">in my experience they just said impulses</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.640" end="00:25:31.820" style="s2">no I don&#39;t disagree with anything you</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.470" end="00:25:48.570" style="s2">about the cross I mean I think about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.970" end="00:25:51.920" style="s2">more in the terms of cross-pollination</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.570" end="00:25:51.920" style="s2">especially amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.630" end="00:26:06.169" style="s2">it was a really nice way of naming your</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.169" end="00:26:14.010" style="s2">because yeah I mean and and that work of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.659" end="00:26:21.630" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re describing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.010" end="00:26:23.820" style="s2">that&#39;s an excellent Lu sedation because</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.820" end="00:26:30.929" style="s2">patients right it&#39;s simpler words</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.320" end="00:26:33.929" style="s2">something of the process that you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.929" end="00:26:35.309" style="s2">hopefully it is unfolding in many</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.470" end="00:26:46.139" style="s2">doing exactly the work you just</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.419" end="00:26:47.370" style="s2">described right in that place of and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.139" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">was talking to a friend of mine who&#39;s up</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:57.510" style="s2">I think it was up in Oregon and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.519" end="00:26:59.159" style="s2">been doing similar convening they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.510" end="00:27:02.370" style="s2">bringing together you know bringing</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.159" end="00:27:04.950" style="s2">together the old you know members of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.370" end="00:27:07.740" style="s2">old logging families that are there</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.950" end="00:27:11.940" style="s2">along with you know city representatives</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.740" end="00:27:15.510" style="s2">along with whatever else to start you</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.940" end="00:27:18.419" style="s2">know within some kind of framing around</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.510" end="00:27:20.639" style="s2">let&#39;s just start to step back a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.419" end="00:27:22.860" style="s2">bit and look at this place we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.639" end="00:27:25.710" style="s2">different way and start to have these</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.860" end="00:27:29.190" style="s2">conversations about the future and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.710" end="00:27:30.840" style="s2">could be possible and you know Nate I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.190" end="00:27:33.000" style="s2">think Kate gray worth came in and did a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.840" end="00:27:33.779" style="s2">doughnut economics lab as part of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.000" end="00:27:36.750" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.779" end="00:27:43.260" style="s2">process and you know that&#39;s good it gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.750" end="00:27:46.380" style="s2">a it just provides some extra inputs</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.260" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">into the place-based creative process I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.380" end="00:27:50.970" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s not about you know doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:52.590" style="s2">exactly the thing and going these</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.970" end="00:27:55.470" style="s2">experts will tell you what to do but</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.590" end="00:27:58.470" style="s2">they they do you know it&#39;s like having</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.470" end="00:28:00.570" style="s2">you come in and give a keynote speech or</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.470" end="00:28:01.860" style="s2">whatever it is somewhere it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.570" end="00:28:03.269" style="s2">battle you because suddenly people go</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.860" end="00:28:04.769" style="s2">well that&#39;s an interesting way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.269" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">thinking I&#39;ve not thought about things</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.769" end="00:28:09.480" style="s2">and quite that way before</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:11.250" style="s2">and it just</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.480" end="00:28:16.490" style="s2">in Richard you know think the goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.250" end="00:28:18.990" style="s2">enrich the creative conversation so but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.490" end="00:28:23.059" style="s2">thing you know people start to just go</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.990" end="00:28:26.100" style="s2">oh that&#39;s interesting it&#39;s not about but</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.059" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll know what to do right it&#39;s hey</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.100" end="00:28:29.929" style="s2">let&#39;s think about these things in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:34.679" style="s2">creative way together and you just see</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.929" end="00:28:38.070" style="s2">where we get to I like it so much better</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.679" end="00:28:40.679" style="s2">that way and like communicated that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.070" end="00:28:42.870" style="s2">because there&#39;s always this slight and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.679" end="00:28:45.049" style="s2">it sorry I mean you&#39;re not American but</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.870" end="00:28:47.940" style="s2">you live in America but it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.049" end="00:28:50.070" style="s2">American oversell of would bring the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.940" end="00:28:53.549" style="s2">expert together and like even you the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.070" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">framing like I as much as I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.549" end="00:29:00.450" style="s2">regeneration is bigger and broader and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.919" end="00:29:04.380" style="s2">more diverse than only the valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.450" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">important lineage of Carroll Sanford and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.380" end="00:29:10.169" style="s2">Regenesis but but in honoring as some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">that lineage like the simple approach of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.169" end="00:29:17.880" style="s2">and starting from we have a team you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.679" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">have a problem we find solutions and one</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.880" end="00:29:24.360" style="s2">of the kind of phrases central to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:26.309" style="s2">way of working regenerative is you start</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.360" end="00:29:32.490" style="s2">from potential and you don&#39;t stop from</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.309" end="00:29:35.309" style="s2">problems and but they I I like in what</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.490" end="00:29:36.870" style="s2">unit describing and rather than kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.309" end="00:29:39.769" style="s2">expert team comes and solves your</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.870" end="00:29:44.100" style="s2">problem but more expert team comes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.769" end="00:29:46.049" style="s2">gives you more multi perspectival from</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.100" end="00:29:48.779" style="s2">multiple intelligences and multiple</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.049" end="00:29:51.210" style="s2">expert disciplines perspective on your</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.779" end="00:29:54.120" style="s2">situation and asks you questions like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.210" end="00:29:55.620" style="s2">mean that&#39;s why in the end as vague as</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.120" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">some people get frustrated they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.620" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">designing regenerative cultures and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:02.970" style="s2">I constantly just ask questions rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">than say I have an answer and they kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.970" end="00:30:07.409" style="s2">of go somewhere else because they were</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:10.500" style="s2">answers but but I find that answers are</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.409" end="00:30:12.659" style="s2">bit arrogant like em it&#39;s the answer</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.500" end="00:30:14.700" style="s2">lies in the process of questioning</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.659" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">together and that&#39;s what you would just</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.700" end="00:30:19.649" style="s2">describe it and I think that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.250" style="s2">humble its more participatory it&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:40.980" style="s2">can we do differently I said well the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.240" end="00:31:43.860" style="s2">way to work with cities is to work with</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.980" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">it within the regional context so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.860" end="00:31:46.560" style="s2">really and and yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:49.500" style="s2">it would have been exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.560" end="00:31:51.570" style="s2">theme of some experts internationally</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.500" end="00:31:54.540" style="s2">reknowned like weaving wrong data to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.570" end="00:31:56.850" style="s2">make people on Majorca bring all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.540" end="00:31:59.790" style="s2">their knowledge about Majorca in in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.850" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">kind of trance contextual data way into</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.790" end="00:32:07.020" style="s2">the room and yeah so far so far it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:13.340" style="s2">just a dream but it&#39;s developing I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.020" end="00:32:13.340" style="s2">these processes are super important so</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.730" end="00:32:18.690" style="s2">how do people engage with : if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.470" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">wants to join it can everybody join or</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.690" end="00:32:25.470" style="s2">you write an application or how does it</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:30.750" style="s2">go this thing it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.470" end="00:32:34.290" style="s2">so one of one of the things that over</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.750" end="00:32:37.790" style="s2">the years I&#39;ve tried running these</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.290" end="00:32:37.790" style="s2">things is that I&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.960" end="00:32:44.770" style="s2">things work better I mean you want a you</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.850" end="00:32:47.890" style="s2">want the diversity of you want this</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.770" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">broad diversity of creative perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.890" end="00:32:56.500" style="s2">as possible because that&#39;s what leads to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:33:03.400" style="s2">creative possibility but you know one</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.500" end="00:33:06.030" style="s2">one one needs to avoid too too much</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.400" end="00:33:13.030" style="s2">dogmatism</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.030" end="00:33:16.600" style="s2">and and certain kinds of negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.030" end="00:33:18.850" style="s2">behaviors so it is a you know we have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.600" end="00:33:23.790" style="s2">we have a boundary around the thing it</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.850" end="00:33:23.790" style="s2">is a currently it&#39;s primarily through</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.850" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">referral ish and you know there is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.900" end="00:33:35.470" style="s2">contact form on the website and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:37.330" style="s2">we we we you know if people reach out</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.470" end="00:33:38.920" style="s2">and are interested I&#39;m you know what</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.920" end="00:33:45.730" style="s2">and have it have a chat with whoever</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.710" end="00:33:48.760" style="s2">which one but you know we&#39;re a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.730" end="00:33:50.290" style="s2">bandwidth constrained so they make it</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.760" end="00:33:52.120" style="s2">may take a while to get back to you you</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.710" end="00:34:04.420" style="s2">goal is yeah the goal isn&#39;t necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.680" end="00:34:07.960" style="s2">grow a really large community right</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.420" end="00:34:09.190" style="s2">that&#39;s not like the where where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.960" end="00:34:13.450" style="s2">heading</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.190" end="00:34:17.800" style="s2">it&#39;s about people who can play play well</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.450" end="00:34:20.110" style="s2">together to help yeah cult the cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.800" end="00:34:22.870" style="s2">the conditions for this a regenerated</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.110" end="00:34:25.120" style="s2">future to emerge but yeah I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.870" end="00:34:28.780" style="s2">people are interested in being part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.120" end="00:34:30.220" style="s2">this then just send us a you know send</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.730" end="00:34:43.810" style="s2">randomness but what what I&#39;ve discovered</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.880" end="00:34:46.540" style="s2">over the last few years is very high</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.810" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">levels of serendipity occurring right</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.540" end="00:34:49.530" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:53.700" style="s2">the people the people who are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.530" end="00:34:56.630" style="s2">listen it&#39;s going to be very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.700" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">people at least from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.630" end="00:35:03.240" style="s2">otherwise if they&#39;re still listening</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">after what it is right now I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.240" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">forty minutes</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.830" end="00:35:12.270" style="s2">what people don&#39;t have a more than five</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.600" end="00:35:15.690" style="s2">minutes attention span on on YouTube so</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.270" end="00:35:17.610" style="s2">particularly about rap to people</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.690" end="00:35:23.820" style="s2">rambling on about how to save the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.610" end="00:35:25.830" style="s2">more effectively in the ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.820" end="00:35:27.660" style="s2">nobody but I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.830" end="00:35:29.910" style="s2">you&#39;ve pulled that together because it</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.660" end="00:35:31.380" style="s2">is like there are all just opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.910" end="00:35:34.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the same like I see it</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.380" end="00:35:36.840" style="s2">like Joe&#39;s kind of working group around</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.920" end="00:35:39.810" style="s2">the book that he&#39;s writing it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.840" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">precisely what in this kind of non</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.810" end="00:35:45.330" style="s2">descriptive way when I was saying like</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:48.270" style="s2">throughout designing regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.330" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">cultures runs this theme almost when I</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.270" end="00:35:52.619" style="s2">read it as I think maybe I&#39;ve overdone</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.600" style="s2">it a bit because I come back and over</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.619" end="00:35:56.369" style="s2">and over again to this living the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.600" end="00:35:58.290" style="s2">questions together having started with</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.369" end="00:36:00.060" style="s2">the the real key quote on you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.290" end="00:36:01.859" style="s2">live the questions and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.060" end="00:36:05.369" style="s2">can&#39;t be given the answers you actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.859" end="00:36:06.900" style="s2">have to live into them and and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.369" end="00:36:09.510" style="s2">that that&#39;s exactly what these things</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.900" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">are they and they have this global</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.510" end="00:36:14.490" style="s2">tension of how do we like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">number of tensions just from again from</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.490" end="00:36:20.660" style="s2">my limited perspectives that I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.260" end="00:36:23.730" style="s2">identified that one tension for me is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.660" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">how much energy to put really locally</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.730" end="00:36:28.530" style="s2">and regionally into the deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:30.630" style="s2">relationship weaving that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.530" end="00:36:32.840" style="s2">with the usual suspect but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.630" end="00:36:35.310" style="s2">much more in a kind of you lab and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.840" end="00:36:39.030" style="s2">all-inclusive thought process bringing</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.310" end="00:36:41.970" style="s2">in like the tourism industry the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.030" end="00:36:44.700" style="s2">local whatever be a delivery company the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.970" end="00:36:47.880" style="s2">local sewage treatment plant all all</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.700" end="00:36:50.340" style="s2">that reality and and the connected lives</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.880" end="00:36:52.290" style="s2">behind that the people who want a job</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.340" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">and just want to feed their children and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.290" end="00:36:59.370" style="s2">and and have a relatively like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:02.940" style="s2">want to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.370" end="00:37:07.460" style="s2">the future of Majorca because that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.940" end="00:37:12.510" style="s2">reality as well and and so for me um</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.460" end="00:37:16.470" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to engage more</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.510" end="00:37:18.030" style="s2">with that but I feel that will take me</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.470" end="00:37:20.520" style="s2">away from having conversations like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.030" end="00:37:22.230" style="s2">one we&#39;re just having right now and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.520" end="00:37:25.050" style="s2">like I&#39;ve had long conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.230" end="00:37:27.650" style="s2">steward about this of the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.050" end="00:37:30.750" style="s2">regenerative communities Network in</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.650" end="00:37:33.210" style="s2">helping all these different regional</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.750" end="00:37:35.730" style="s2">initiatives to learn from each other and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.210" end="00:37:38.820" style="s2">with each other in the right balance</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.730" end="00:37:41.100" style="s2">between that learning and exchange and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.820" end="00:37:45.120" style="s2">open innovation and maybe even support</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.100" end="00:37:46.740" style="s2">in in different ways and giving them the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.120" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">time to actually do the work locally so</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.740" end="00:37:51.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t disappear in the networking</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:53.250" style="s2">in the reporting back to the global</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.120" end="00:37:55.350" style="s2">community about something that is going</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.250" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">terribly slow because nobody is putting</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.350" end="00:37:59.840" style="s2">attention there um and for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:03.120" style="s2">always been a bit of attention to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.840" end="00:38:07.230" style="s2">working locally it&#39;s it&#39;s like in iff</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.120" end="00:38:10.020" style="s2">and three horizons h3 you need terms</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.230" end="00:38:12.690" style="s2">it&#39;s dilemma navigation like in in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.020" end="00:38:15.450" style="s2">second horizon space we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.690" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">doing the ulema navigation between stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.450" end="00:38:22.530" style="s2">that I is kind of Hospice in the dying</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:25.170" style="s2">system and stuff that is Midwife in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.530" end="00:38:30.810" style="s2">new system and and and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.170" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">necessary to my mind yeah well now I</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.810" end="00:38:36.559" style="s2">mean cause back to the the bridge thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:41.309" style="s2">right it is as yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.559" end="00:38:43.260" style="s2">but somebody there is that dynamic about</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.309" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">tension you just described yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.260" end="00:38:48.950" style="s2">describe to well then the year that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">there is a need and not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.950" end="00:38:57.890" style="s2">bridges you know yeah there is hyper I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:39:01.529" style="s2">believe at least there is high value in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.890" end="00:39:04.279" style="s2">that particular bridging function from</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.529" end="00:39:10.109" style="s2">the group of local bridging function</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.279" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">because it does it allows you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.109" end="00:39:15.299" style="s2">like a cell right you know again you</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:18.299" style="s2">know that berries and nutrient flows</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.299" end="00:39:22.349" style="s2">through the cell boundary to the cell</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.349" end="00:39:27.390" style="s2">the you know that that boundary needs to</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.930" end="00:39:30.990" style="s2">exist because you need to otherwise</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.990" end="00:39:38.220" style="s2">want to be in a a you know and you put a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.430" end="00:39:40.950" style="s2">cell in a saline solution or some kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.220" end="00:39:44.670" style="s2">of gradient right and it just sucks all</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.950" end="00:39:46.799" style="s2">of the the water out of the cell and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.670" end="00:39:48.829" style="s2">kills the thing so you don&#39;t want too</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.799" end="00:39:52.680" style="s2">much outward flow and you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.829" end="00:39:56.009" style="s2">huge inward flow because anything which</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.680" end="00:39:58.829" style="s2">just blows up so it is how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.009" end="00:40:01.500" style="s2">yourself give that thing the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.829" end="00:40:04.890" style="s2">boundary where you&#39;ve got the right flow</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.500" end="00:40:07.819" style="s2">of nutrients that makes the system as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.890" end="00:40:10.380" style="s2">whole flourish free and so there is and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.819" end="00:40:13.079" style="s2">it&#39;s different if you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.380" end="00:40:14.579" style="s2">constantly shifting what you need now</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.079" end="00:40:16.950" style="s2">and what you mean tomorrow and what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.579" end="00:40:19.890" style="s2">need the next day and how you balance</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.950" end="00:40:22.920" style="s2">those things out it&#39;s a dynamic it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.890" end="00:40:25.799" style="s2">ongoing dance that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.920" end="00:40:27.960" style="s2">continually just going what&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.799" end="00:40:31.640" style="s2">thing you know what&#39;s the balance right</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.960" end="00:40:34.380" style="s2">now and whatever reason I&#39;ve taken on I</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.640" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">like I like your mother&#39;s was made they</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.380" end="00:40:40.559" style="s2">both do get organismic metaphor and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:43.140" style="s2">dancing metaphor that&#39;s it&#39;s so ya know</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.559" end="00:40:44.779" style="s2">actually as you were describing it I had</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.140" end="00:40:47.579" style="s2">this idea for I even wrote it down here</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.779" end="00:40:48.950" style="s2">could be a poem could be it could be an</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.579" end="00:40:57.290" style="s2">essay and the O&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.950" end="00:40:58.970" style="s2">take balance of glocal it is like how</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.290" end="00:40:59.570" style="s2">much can do you get sucked out of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.970" end="00:41:02.450" style="s2">system money</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.570" end="00:41:03.950" style="s2">ya know is bad but that&#39;s for me like</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.450" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s actually speaking to something</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.950" end="00:41:07.369" style="s2">that they are saying that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:10.490" style="s2">couple of pitfalls there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.369" end="00:41:13.070" style="s2">pitfall or the the dilemma between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.490" end="00:41:17.770" style="s2">glocal dynamic em then there&#39;s a dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.070" end="00:41:21.050" style="s2">to my mind that the minute you bring in</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.770" end="00:41:23.450" style="s2">even well-meaning financier types into</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.050" end="00:41:25.190" style="s2">these kind of situations like even like</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.450" end="00:41:27.859" style="s2">for example you&#39;re super successful with</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.190" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">with the collab and suddenly you some</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.859" end="00:41:32.450" style="s2">some really big money says yeah cool</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:33.950" style="s2">will will underwrite you and will bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.450" end="00:41:35.690" style="s2">in all this money and you just go into</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.950" end="00:41:38.119" style="s2">lo all these locations around the globe</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.690" end="00:41:40.099" style="s2">and we&#39;re bootstrap and and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.119" end="00:41:42.320" style="s2">blah yeah but but there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.099" end="00:41:50.450" style="s2">people like that in in the Bay Area you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.320" end="00:41:52.339" style="s2">know that and em and then you because</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.450" end="00:41:55.010" style="s2">you&#39;re also bringing money you skew</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.339" end="00:41:57.770" style="s2">quite a lot of the relationships to when</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.010" end="00:41:59.750" style="s2">you come into a local process huh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.770" end="00:42:01.099" style="s2">not just the expert the global experts</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.750" end="00:42:03.890" style="s2">that are flying in you&#39;re also bringing</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.099" end="00:42:07.460" style="s2">money and and so people are rolling over</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.890" end="00:42:10.010" style="s2">and playing along a bit because because</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.460" end="00:42:13.819" style="s2">of that and and and that&#39;s also possibly</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.010" end="00:42:15.970" style="s2">dangerous and so there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.819" end="00:42:18.290" style="s2">there&#39;s really like how do we enable</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.970" end="00:42:21.740" style="s2">finance to flow into regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.290" end="00:42:24.589" style="s2">projects like then very close to that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.740" end="00:42:31.690" style="s2">the whole although get people working on</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.589" end="00:42:34.599" style="s2">on holo and and other kind of tokens</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.690" end="00:42:39.770" style="s2">Bitcoin enough Bitcoin but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.599" end="00:42:41.569" style="s2">blockchain based yeah yeah I deeply</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.770" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">believe and I know some of the people in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.569" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">those spaces that they did completely</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:47.839" style="s2">committed and doing doing wanting to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.430" style="s2">good work and wanting to serve and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.839" end="00:42:51.319" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole kind of are we</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.430" end="00:42:55.510" style="s2">enabling are we building infrastructures</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.319" end="00:42:58.510" style="s2">that will somehow enable a enclosure of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.510" end="00:42:58.510" style="s2">em</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.190" end="00:43:03.450" style="s2">different types of capital that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.330" end="00:43:07.660" style="s2">currently actually still outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.450" end="00:43:10.500" style="s2">economy like real social capital and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.660" end="00:43:13.000" style="s2">real natural capital the minute we</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.500" end="00:43:15.820" style="s2">monetize it and even though if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.000" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">through some kind of other mechanism it</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.820" end="00:43:19.500" style="s2">becomes really dangerous because then</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.380" end="00:43:23.410" style="s2">you can what it can get one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.500" end="00:43:26.080" style="s2">translation into real currencies and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.410" end="00:43:28.210" style="s2">suddenly you you meant to do well and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.080" end="00:43:31.480" style="s2">bring this into a more balanced more</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.210" end="00:43:33.010" style="s2">holistic economic accounting but in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.480" end="00:43:36.760" style="s2">process you actually created the monster</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.010" end="00:43:40.180" style="s2">that enables the monetization of human</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.760" end="00:43:42.940" style="s2">relationships and bio productivity and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.180" end="00:43:44.920" style="s2">that&#39;s also a bit of a dilemma because</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.940" end="00:43:46.660" style="s2">on the one hand it serves and on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.920" end="00:43:48.460" style="s2">other hand it doesn&#39;t the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.660" end="00:43:51.730" style="s2">technology thing is always a dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.460" end="00:43:54.700" style="s2">like like how super tech does a</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.730" end="00:43:56.620" style="s2">regenerative future have to be and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.700" end="00:43:58.330" style="s2">if it is so super like that&#39;s what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.620" end="00:44:00.550" style="s2">realized a lot with this whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.330" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">corporate thing in and people getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.550" end="00:44:07.240" style="s2">into like even people who I would have</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:10.180" style="s2">thought a wiser saying oh yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.240" end="00:44:15.580" style="s2">just all be monitored by our smartphones</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.180" end="00:44:19.480" style="s2">and have chinese-style control yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.580" end="00:44:23.430" style="s2">I just don&#39;t get that that people really</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.480" end="00:44:27.940" style="s2">believe that a that&#39;s a desirable future</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.430" end="00:44:30.700" style="s2">be there&#39;s a colonialism in that because</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.940" end="00:44:32.740" style="s2">there are lots of cultures that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.700" end="00:44:34.540" style="s2">actually want to use smartphones all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.740" end="00:44:37.270" style="s2">time that don&#39;t want to have their lives</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.540" end="00:44:39.070" style="s2">ruled by a bunch of tokens that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.270" end="00:44:41.050" style="s2">zeros and ones in a virtual space</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.070" end="00:44:42.970" style="s2">they&#39;re choosing to live the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.050" end="00:44:45.880" style="s2">experience and the human-like being</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.970" end="00:44:48.010" style="s2">human in different sets of relationships</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.880" end="00:44:50.290" style="s2">and if we want to be a regenerative we</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.010" end="00:44:53.110" style="s2">need to create a diverse space where</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.290" end="00:44:54.760" style="s2">those people have equal rights to stand</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.110" end="00:44:57.790" style="s2">in the world and be active and have</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.760" end="00:45:00.070" style="s2">rights in the world without having to</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.180" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">world for me that&#39;s a big shadow that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.540" end="00:45:11.020" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about when we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:13.320" style="s2">bringing</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.020" end="00:45:16.270" style="s2">regenitive solutions into into the world</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.270" end="00:45:30.910" style="s2">tech backdrop and what do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.090" end="00:45:48.870" style="s2">that I know it&#39;s fascinating the what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.910" end="00:45:53.980" style="s2">think that I mean my eye I yeah inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.870" end="00:45:59.100" style="s2">because you get an easy easy way out</p>

<p begin="00:46:18.370" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">technology there is value in finance</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.470" end="00:46:26.080" style="s2">their tools the way humans have created</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:28.750" style="s2">an amazing look at people smart people</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.980" end="00:47:53.990" style="s2">things that we refer to as money that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.049" end="00:47:57.230" style="s2">allow but allow us to exchange these</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.990" end="00:47:59.510" style="s2">totally abstract things between</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.230" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">ourselves an account and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.510" end="00:48:04.910" style="s2">create accounting systems and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:09.290" style="s2">else that allow our economies to work in</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.910" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">a in a different way you know I could</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.290" end="00:48:14.329" style="s2">say that in a higher way but I&#39;m not has</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:17.750" style="s2">some kind of implicit value judgment and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.329" end="00:48:20.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that should be there so if</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.750" end="00:48:23.240" style="s2">we have these kinds of incentive</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.030" end="00:48:25.609" style="s2">incentives at the end of the day comes</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.240" end="00:48:30.200" style="s2">down to human consciousness right of how</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.609" end="00:48:32.839" style="s2">humans interact with these economic</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.200" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">systems that have emerged around us we</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.839" end="00:48:38.839" style="s2">can&#39;t and all the digital tools are that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:44.660" style="s2">we&#39;re creating and these other financial</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.839" end="00:48:48.380" style="s2">structures are just in half more refined</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.660" end="00:48:50.349" style="s2">ways of thinking about how economic</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.380" end="00:48:53.690" style="s2">activity in the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.349" end="00:48:55.490" style="s2">interrelate that become some of which</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.690" end="00:48:58.760" style="s2">becomes possible because of digital</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.490" end="00:49:02.660" style="s2">technologies or at least the accounting</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.760" end="00:49:06.049" style="s2">part of that but yeah you know embedding</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.660" end="00:49:09.819" style="s2">human nature within those macro</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.049" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">accounting systems will lead to perverse</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.819" end="00:49:18.140" style="s2">behaviors which won&#39;t and yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">will lead to the kind of you know people</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.140" end="00:49:22.099" style="s2">going oh yeah we must do this natural</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:25.880" style="s2">accounting system with this digital</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.099" end="00:49:27.859" style="s2">technology here because that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.880" end="00:49:30.890" style="s2">the big fallacies that I hear over and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.859" end="00:49:35.690" style="s2">over again that people say just because</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.890" end="00:49:36.890" style="s2">you design and I&#39;m all for designing as</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.690" end="00:49:42.470" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.890" end="00:49:44.030" style="s2">M or doing biomimetic design and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.470" end="00:49:48.500" style="s2">many weapons systems have been designed</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.030" end="00:49:50.870" style="s2">with biomimetic examples and how I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.500" end="00:49:54.230" style="s2">so basically you can turn I mean all</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.870" end="00:49:59.690" style="s2">technologies like that can be turned to</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.230" end="00:50:03.260" style="s2">good or to evil and and for me that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.690" end="00:50:05.420" style="s2">way that we like for example just today</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.260" end="00:50:07.180" style="s2">I had a conversation on social media</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.420" end="00:50:10.520" style="s2">with somebody about the whole like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.180" end="00:50:14.120" style="s2">Venus Project and Jack Fresno&#39;s vision</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.520" end="00:50:19.000" style="s2">of the world and I don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.120" end="00:50:24.230" style="s2">live in a world where some kind of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.000" end="00:50:27.320" style="s2">AI is measuring all forms of resources</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.230" end="00:50:29.780" style="s2">and all my activities and and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.320" end="00:50:32.090" style="s2">run bound a multiple scorecard of things</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.780" end="00:50:33.620" style="s2">up and down and up and down but I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.090" end="00:50:37.160" style="s2">an equal share but I&#39;m completely</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.620" end="00:50:39.830" style="s2">basically plugged into the system and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.160" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">sort of assumes that there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.830" end="00:50:45.350" style="s2">benevolent of the scientists it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:47.420" style="s2">always in fresnels kind of oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.350" end="00:50:49.930" style="s2">that&#39;s good there are after worry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.420" end="00:50:54.230" style="s2">the scientists they&#39;re clever people</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.930" end="00:51:00.200" style="s2">it&#39;s simplistic isn&#39;t and by which</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.230" end="00:51:02.630" style="s2">scientists and and but but in a similar</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.200" end="00:51:05.060" style="s2">way of noticed this like in your my yoga</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.630" end="00:51:08.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve had conversation with people around</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.060" end="00:51:11.000" style="s2">a campfire or in other settings where I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.630" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">thought this is my I&#39;m with my people</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.000" end="00:51:15.320" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about supporting local</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:19.310" style="s2">farmers and and building a local economy</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.320" end="00:51:22.250" style="s2">and and reconnecting with the story of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.310" end="00:51:24.440" style="s2">place and and the ancient myths of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.250" end="00:51:27.140" style="s2">Majorca and and keeping them alive in</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.440" end="00:51:29.570" style="s2">the modern world and all of that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.140" end="00:51:31.430" style="s2">nice yeah and then suddenly you realize</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.570" end="00:51:37.450" style="s2">they&#39;re in that circles actually in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.430" end="00:51:40.490" style="s2">sort of right-wing return to the local</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.450" end="00:51:43.670" style="s2">building lifeboats in a difficult world</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.490" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">keeping the foreigners out and I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.670" end="00:51:47.540" style="s2">did their subtlety and the very small</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:49.670" style="s2">yeah but but what I&#39;m saying is that in</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.540" end="00:51:54.109" style="s2">the bioregional in</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.670" end="00:51:56.510" style="s2">pulse we also have to be aware that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.109" end="00:52:00.770" style="s2">there is an underbelly of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.510" end="00:52:03.260" style="s2">realization in there if it&#39;s not done</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.770" end="00:52:05.780" style="s2">globally with global solidarity and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.260" end="00:52:09.799" style="s2">global open knowledge exchange and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.780" end="00:52:12.619" style="s2">support to both heal place and planet</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.799" end="00:52:14.240" style="s2">then it very quickly can become of oh no</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.619" end="00:52:17.780" style="s2">we&#39;re just trying to get it right for us</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:19.160" style="s2">we&#39;re just a bunch of like made a bunch</p>

<p begin="00:55:54.470" end="00:56:01.089" style="s2">all the other changes well that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.079" end="00:56:04.369" style="s2">gone out of the window and so like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.089" end="00:56:06.140" style="s2">think tourism isn&#39;t gonna recover not</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.369" end="00:56:08.120" style="s2">even in the next three or four years if</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.140" end="00:56:09.830" style="s2">it recovers if</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.120" end="00:56:15.130" style="s2">the system that it sits in recovers</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.830" end="00:56:17.930" style="s2">which is also still a big if but but</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.130" end="00:56:20.480" style="s2">yeah eighty percent dependency on</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.930" end="00:56:22.520" style="s2">tourism so I live in a completely like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:25.100" style="s2">mean basically the island is in ruins</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.520" end="00:56:28.850" style="s2">with regard to its economy and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.100" end="00:56:30.680" style="s2">collapse of course could be terrific but</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.850" end="00:56:35.720" style="s2">it could also be a terrific opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.680" end="00:56:37.130" style="s2">and so we&#39;ll see oh yeah but the first</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.720" end="00:56:40.130" style="s2">use of the word terrific they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.130" end="00:56:45.530" style="s2">actually more around the original</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.130" end="00:56:47.840" style="s2">meaning of terror yeah terrific in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.530" end="00:56:49.640" style="s2">sense of oh my god what has just</p>
