<p begin="00:00:28.130" end="00:00:36.930" style="s2">Jordan Peterson Peterson mr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">Canadian psychology professor is</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.930" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">somebody people love or love to hate so</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:45.390" style="s2">Patricia I know that your interest in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">Jordan Peterson was well before the sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.390" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">of controversy that happened sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:50.129" style="s2">starting in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:53.430" style="s2">can you tell me why you were interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.129" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">in in him and how long ago have you been</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.430" end="00:00:58.980" style="s2">interested in doing a film with him I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">first came across Jordan&#39;s work in 2003</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.980" end="00:01:02.969" style="s2">back when I was a psychology undergrad</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">student I was taking a lot of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.969" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">classes I was very much in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:10.830" style="s2">the big existential questions trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:15.080" style="s2">find my way you know lost early 20s</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.830" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">something and I came from a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.080" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">religious Roman Catholic Italian family</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:26.420" style="s2">I moved away from religion and there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">something about Jordans book that I felt</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.420" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">kind of went down to that religious</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">level and a lot of the talks that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:36.930" style="s2">later saw coming out on TV oh and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">Canada were about things like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:40.619" style="s2">necessity of virtue it was engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">these ethical and kind of religious</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.619" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">questions so it sort of filled in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">gap for me and I was also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">the way that he talked about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">the divine individual and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">um you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a divinity</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">to to paying attention to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">interested in and and where that takes</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">you and it&#39;s not just something</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">frivolous there&#39;s there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">importance to and kind of like a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">that comes with you paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:09.959" style="s2">and following like that was a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">important guide for me and actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.959" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">something that guided me towards later</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:16.450" style="s2">pursuing this film I felt</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">like it was something really important</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.450" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">for me to do but I didn&#39;t understand why</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:25.630" style="s2">and it was especially his introduction</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:28.660" style="s2">to maps of meaning where he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.630" end="00:02:30.550" style="s2">having had nightmares during his teenage</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.660" end="00:02:32.680" style="s2">years about the end of the world and he</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.550" end="00:02:34.750" style="s2">was trying to decipher the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:36.460" style="s2">evil and not only this broad question</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.750" end="00:02:38.500" style="s2">but it was something personal to him so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.460" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">I was interested in the ideas but I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.500" end="00:02:45.340" style="s2">also interested in the person behind the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">ideas and so I finally reached out to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.340" end="00:02:52.270" style="s2">him in 2015 about making a film</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:54.220" style="s2">interestingly one of the ideas that led</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.270" end="00:02:56.550" style="s2">me to his book maps of meaning early on</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.220" end="00:02:59.560" style="s2">was just from reading different</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.550" end="00:03:01.480" style="s2">philosophers I sort of came to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.560" end="00:03:04.060" style="s2">conclusion that you can have two people</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.480" end="00:03:05.739" style="s2">in the same room you know in the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.060" end="00:03:08.440" style="s2">place at the same coffee table in front</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.739" end="00:03:10.930" style="s2">of them but your belief system and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.440" end="00:03:12.880" style="s2">way you frame the world informs reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.930" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">to the extent where we can literally be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.880" end="00:03:15.880" style="s2">in two different realities even if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">beside each other and this was like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.880" end="00:03:21.070" style="s2">big aha moment for me of well we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">of screwed like how can people really</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.070" end="00:03:25.690" style="s2">understand each other and resolve</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:28.180" style="s2">conflicts and I remember that being the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.690" end="00:03:30.250" style="s2">initial thing that somehow led me I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.180" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">think through so at Google search to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.250" end="00:03:36.370" style="s2">maps of meaning so it&#39;s interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">I you know later found myself working on</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.370" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">this film about Jordan&#39;s comments on</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:43.390" style="s2">Bill c16 involving into all of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">other these other issues of political</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.390" end="00:03:48.940" style="s2">correctness but with with this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:54.310" style="s2">culture war looming underneath all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.940" end="00:03:57.640" style="s2">that so it&#39;s been I guess an evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.310" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">of a lot of different ideas and given</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.640" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">that you&#39;re kind of interest was much</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:05.230" style="s2">more in kind of mythological and his</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:07.810" style="s2">ideas what did he think or what did he</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.230" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">feel at the time when all of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.810" end="00:04:12.910" style="s2">c16 stuff started taking over was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:15.459" style="s2">feeling of all fantastic I&#39;m following a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.910" end="00:04:16.780" style="s2">really a live story or was it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.459" end="00:04:18.280" style="s2">like oh this is not the direction I</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.780" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">wanted this film to go in was it both</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.280" end="00:04:22.599" style="s2">for those it&#39;s interesting because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:24.310" style="s2">guess the film kind of morphed a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.599" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">of times because initially was about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:29.770" style="s2">ideas but then it started</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:31.240" style="s2">the film became about following Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:04:33.460" style="s2">and his friendship with Charles Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.240" end="00:04:35.849" style="s2">and Jordans renovations to his home how</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.460" end="00:04:38.289" style="s2">he was adding a third story Charles&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.849" end="00:04:40.539" style="s2">family was adopting Jordan and giving</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.289" end="00:04:42.729" style="s2">him a name in qua quality Aras</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.539" end="00:04:46.180" style="s2">indigenous language so I had already</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.729" end="00:04:49.539" style="s2">decided to shift from ideas to how the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.180" end="00:04:51.669" style="s2">ideas manifest in his life and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.539" end="00:04:55.270" style="s2">well that&#39;s a more interesting Avenue to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.669" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">pursue for a film so I was already kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.270" end="00:04:59.319" style="s2">of taking a human approach but then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:00.879" style="s2">thing I didn&#39;t expect was I would I</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.319" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t start off with an intention of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.879" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">making a film about political issues as</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:10.180" style="s2">well so I would say that came as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:12.849" style="s2">surprise I don&#39;t think I ever felt like</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.180" end="00:05:16.780" style="s2">oh well this isn&#39;t where I want the film</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.849" end="00:05:19.599" style="s2">to go but it was uncomfortable for me</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.780" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">for sure but the way I see the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.599" end="00:05:26.770" style="s2">filmmaking process is you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:29.979" style="s2">in a way I mean it&#39;s an honor and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.770" end="00:05:31.870" style="s2">privilege to to be able and hard work to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.979" end="00:05:33.159" style="s2">be making a film about something and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">think when you&#39;re really engaging in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.159" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">artistic process it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:42.969" style="s2">becoming a vessel to to showcase this</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:44.440" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s like it&#39;s not up to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.969" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">you have no idea where it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.440" end="00:05:49.419" style="s2">you you have to just kind of follow</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:51.129" style="s2">where it leads and it&#39;s hard it can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.419" end="00:05:54.580" style="s2">really uncomfortable it certainly was</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.129" end="00:05:58.680" style="s2">for me but I learned a lot along the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.580" end="00:06:02.440" style="s2">and I I always felt dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.680" end="00:06:04.690" style="s2">pursuing it regardless of where it took</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.440" end="00:06:08.229" style="s2">me what the reception been like and has</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.690" end="00:06:10.599" style="s2">it surprised you in any way it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.229" end="00:06:13.750" style="s2">interesting to release the film because</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.599" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">we had television cut a 44 minute</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.750" end="00:06:20.349" style="s2">version of this film released a year ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:23.289" style="s2">in Canada only and I think it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.349" end="00:06:24.940" style="s2">bit of a surprise for us to now release</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.289" end="00:06:27.339" style="s2">a longer version of the film and to run</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">in more controversy even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.339" end="00:06:33.550" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty similar to the first film</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:36.750" style="s2">that we released to the one extent we</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.550" end="00:06:39.159" style="s2">weren&#39;t surprised because we know how</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.750" end="00:06:39.880" style="s2">dividing Jordan&#39;s name can be in a room</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.159" end="00:06:42.550" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.880" end="00:06:45.850" style="s2">how he still is controversial among the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.550" end="00:06:49.240" style="s2">the arthouse and kind of left wing which</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.850" end="00:06:51.700" style="s2">has become mainstream culture but we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.240" end="00:06:53.260" style="s2">were hoping to get more of a release in</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.700" end="00:06:55.450" style="s2">the art house and mainstream theaters</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.260" end="00:06:57.300" style="s2">but then I guess the most surprising</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.450" end="00:07:00.340" style="s2">part was the theater the theater</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.300" end="00:07:02.950" style="s2">cancellations that we got so we had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.340" end="00:07:04.900" style="s2">week-long run canceled in Toronto we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.950" end="00:07:07.290" style="s2">another screening canceled in Brooklyn</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.900" end="00:07:09.640" style="s2">and another one canceled in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.290" end="00:07:13.090" style="s2">another one that we were trying to set</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.640" end="00:07:15.310" style="s2">up in Houston that didn&#39;t happen because</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.090" end="00:07:16.270" style="s2">they were afraid of controversy so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.310" end="00:07:18.220" style="s2">interesting thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.270" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">cancellations is they were all because</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.220" end="00:07:24.520" style="s2">of staff complaints so it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:26.350" style="s2">curators themselves like they had</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.520" end="00:07:29.830" style="s2">already said yes but then the staff</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.350" end="00:07:31.990" style="s2">complained feeling like well most cases</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.830" end="00:07:34.840" style="s2">they hadn&#39;t seen the film but they felt</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.990" end="00:07:37.060" style="s2">like it would be unsafe to have Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.840" end="00:07:38.440" style="s2">fans coming to the theater but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.060" end="00:07:41.050" style="s2">always been very important for us to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.440" end="00:07:42.520" style="s2">have a theatrical release of the film</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.050" end="00:07:44.290" style="s2">because we want to be in the room with</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.520" end="00:07:46.870" style="s2">people when they see the film it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.290" end="00:07:48.550" style="s2">a conversation starter we had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.870" end="00:07:50.440" style="s2">test screenings in our living room where</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.550" end="00:07:52.060" style="s2">we had such interesting conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.440" end="00:07:53.620" style="s2">with a diverse group of people watching</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.060" end="00:07:55.690" style="s2">the film so we wanted to replicate that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.620" end="00:07:59.350" style="s2">through a theatrical release the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.690" end="00:08:02.140" style="s2">that came to see the film I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.350" end="00:08:03.730" style="s2">know people really respected the film</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.140" end="00:08:05.830" style="s2">they enjoyed watching all the intimate</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.730" end="00:08:08.680" style="s2">stuff you know there&#39;s a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.830" end="00:08:11.530" style="s2">primary content there and like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.680" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">if you&#39;re a fan of Jordan you see the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.530" end="00:08:15.100" style="s2">film and you feel almost like an</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.980" style="s2">intimacy to the guy because you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.100" end="00:08:19.960" style="s2">in his room you&#39;re there having</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.980" end="00:08:21.880" style="s2">breakfast with Tammy you know so people</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.960" end="00:08:23.470" style="s2">really get a kick out of that but then</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.880" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">when it came to the ideas and the kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.470" end="00:08:30.630" style="s2">of the politics they were surprised I</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:33.880" style="s2">think about how balanced the film is and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.630" end="00:08:35.979" style="s2">that we never used it for example to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.880" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">trans activist as a punch line you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.979" end="00:08:39.419" style="s2">it would&#39;ve been very easy to do that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:42.550" style="s2">would have probably been more lucrative</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.419" end="00:08:44.260" style="s2">to do that because partisanship pays</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.550" end="00:08:47.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned going on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.260" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">tour but at but at the same time these</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.950" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">these Peterson fans that came out and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:53.500" style="s2">chatted us up afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:55.930" style="s2">they really respected that they like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.500" end="00:08:58.570" style="s2">that certain things were challenging in</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.930" end="00:09:01.830" style="s2">the film and how we showed the two</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.570" end="00:09:04.150" style="s2">different sides as best we could but</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.830" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">focusing on the human part like who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.150" end="00:09:10.540" style="s2">these people why did they think the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">they think and it was a great example of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.540" end="00:09:15.610" style="s2">a documentary documents reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">realities messy and hard to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.610" end="00:09:20.680" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it overnight so we like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:22.300" style="s2">that people got that even though they</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.680" end="00:09:23.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t expect that and maybe almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.300" end="00:09:25.020" style="s2">maybe even expected something like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.950" end="00:09:29.410" style="s2">robber</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.020" end="00:09:32.470" style="s2">sjw&#39;s are ruining everything you know we</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.410" end="00:09:34.180" style="s2">definitely show the overreach of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.470" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">left of course because we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.180" end="00:09:37.780" style="s2">free speech issues that happen that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:42.820" style="s2">have tea here but we quickly go into</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.780" end="00:09:44.650" style="s2">kind of who is this guy and what is his</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.820" end="00:09:48.070" style="s2">life like what is what is what has this</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.650" end="00:09:51.940" style="s2">been like for Jordan so that people</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.070" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">really appreciated so that felt good it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.940" end="00:09:56.500" style="s2">felt really nice to get that after these</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:09:58.690" style="s2">cancellations you know and in the film</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.500" end="00:10:02.620" style="s2">there&#39;s this one scene where Jordan puts</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.690" end="00:10:05.170" style="s2">a mask on his face and it sort of says I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.620" end="00:10:07.210" style="s2">think it&#39;s something about which one is</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.170" end="00:10:09.190" style="s2">the real Jordan so this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.210" end="00:10:11.050" style="s2">actually look like a nemesis where</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.190" end="00:10:12.980" style="s2">people who don&#39;t like you think I live</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.050" end="00:10:16.029" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.980" end="00:10:16.029" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.430" end="00:10:21.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good question while I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.380" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">would say they&#39;re both real I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.080" end="00:10:24.350" style="s2">maybe Patricia you ask him which one is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:27.050" style="s2">true and he says well that they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.350" end="00:10:29.990" style="s2">true what do you think he meant by that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.050" end="00:10:32.060" style="s2">yeah so that was such an impromptu</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.990" end="00:10:33.620" style="s2">moment of just setting up for an</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.060" end="00:10:34.910" style="s2">interview with him and I always loved</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.620" end="00:10:37.220" style="s2">that moment because I think it speaks</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.910" end="00:10:39.590" style="s2">volumes and there&#39;s all these layers to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:41.480" style="s2">it right so on the one hand Jordan talks</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.590" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">about the idea of the monster and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.480" end="00:10:46.220" style="s2">it&#39;s important to encounter your dark</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:50.030" style="s2">side and he&#39;s very young and influenced</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.220" end="00:10:53.690" style="s2">of course and so on the one hand I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.030" end="00:10:55.910" style="s2">he&#39;s saying you know I&#39;m human I&#39;m this</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.690" end="00:10:58.430" style="s2">normal person but I&#39;m also a monster and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.910" end="00:11:00.680" style="s2">in order to be a good person you also</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.430" end="00:11:03.350" style="s2">need to be a monster you need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.680" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">knife but not necessarily use it but but</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.350" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">know that you&#39;re not going to take</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:13.100" style="s2">advantage of me kind of thing so I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:16.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what he means there and how was</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.100" end="00:11:21.520" style="s2">your opinion of him been changed by</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.760" end="00:11:24.350" style="s2">making the film so I came across him as</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.520" end="00:11:25.940" style="s2">someone speaking about profound ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.350" end="00:11:28.070" style="s2">that were really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.940" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">impactful for me I was in my early 20s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.070" end="00:11:33.080" style="s2">and he was addressing the big</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:35.540" style="s2">existential questions and the kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.080" end="00:11:37.160" style="s2">came from a very religious family but</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.540" end="00:11:39.080" style="s2">went away from religion and so there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.160" end="00:11:41.420" style="s2">something about his work that was going</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.080" end="00:11:44.810" style="s2">down to that level that would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.420" end="00:11:48.470" style="s2">fill in the gap of at least engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.810" end="00:11:51.560" style="s2">that religious space I would say so by</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.470" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">the time I reached out to him to make a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.560" end="00:11:55.940" style="s2">film about him in 2015 after having had</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:58.940" style="s2">this idea at the back of my mind for</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.940" end="00:12:00.650" style="s2">many years for me he was this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.940" end="00:12:02.270" style="s2">larger-than-life figure which is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.650" end="00:12:04.130" style="s2">interesting because now he&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.270" end="00:12:06.200" style="s2">larger-than-life figure for most people</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.130" end="00:12:09.860" style="s2">and for me he&#39;s a human being but I kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.200" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">of had this like reverse experience of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.860" end="00:12:16.190" style="s2">that so it&#39;s been a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:18.620" style="s2">roller-coaster ride I would say when he</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.190" end="00:12:20.990" style="s2">released those the videos the professor</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.620" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">gains political correctness videos it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.990" end="00:12:24.860" style="s2">came as a surprise to us we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:27.500" style="s2">the videos were coming we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.860" end="00:12:29.150" style="s2">how much he was thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.500" end="00:12:30.770" style="s2">stuff you know we had some</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.150" end="00:12:33.830" style="s2">preliminary conversations with him about</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.770" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">political correctness but the Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.830" end="00:12:39.589" style="s2">Peterson that I knew before that his</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.640" style="s2">views about that stuff was at least you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.589" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">know the way I knew of him as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.640" end="00:12:44.839" style="s2">professor in public speaker those things</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.290" end="00:12:48.140" style="s2">were more hidden so this was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.839" end="00:12:51.770" style="s2">a very new step for him to be coming out</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.140" end="00:12:54.920" style="s2">and speaking so publicly and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.770" end="00:12:57.980" style="s2">advocating for specific things so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.920" end="00:13:03.050" style="s2">was new I would say it was well it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.980" end="00:13:05.510" style="s2">very uncomfortable for me that the you</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.050" end="00:13:08.960" style="s2">know the hill he chose to a stick as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.510" end="00:13:12.529" style="s2">pole and was about trans pronouns and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.960" end="00:13:15.140" style="s2">human rights law I understand why that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.529" end="00:13:16.279" style="s2">raised a lot of red flags for people I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.140" end="00:13:17.810" style="s2">mean you&#39;re criticizing a human rights</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.279" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">law it&#39;s like whoa what what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.810" end="00:13:23.800" style="s2">going on with that guy I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:27.470" style="s2">reaction so it was an uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.800" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">process but it also forced me to dig</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.470" end="00:13:34.820" style="s2">deeper into a lot of issues that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:36.709" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t realize and that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.820" end="00:13:37.970" style="s2">wasn&#39;t thinking about on a deep enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.709" end="00:13:39.380" style="s2">level or that I didn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.970" end="00:13:42.680" style="s2">articulate what was really going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.380" end="00:13:46.370" style="s2">about so it forced a lot of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.680" end="00:13:49.820" style="s2">thinking for me and I guess I would say</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.370" end="00:13:51.529" style="s2">fundamentally it just witnessing Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.820" end="00:13:54.950" style="s2">go through this tumultuous period of his</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.529" end="00:13:57.620" style="s2">life just revealed how human he is to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.950" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">so I guess it&#39;s going from for me him</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.620" end="00:14:00.980" style="s2">being this larger-than-life figure to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">really this this human being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.980" end="00:14:06.950" style="s2">trying to adapt as this this crazy</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:08.360" style="s2">phenomenon is emerging in his life he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.950" end="00:14:09.890" style="s2">trying to stand up for something he</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.360" end="00:14:11.380" style="s2">believes in and there&#39;s things that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.890" end="00:14:14.120" style="s2">agree with things that I disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.380" end="00:14:16.100" style="s2">but but fundamentally just like seeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.120" end="00:14:19.130" style="s2">then how he would adapt to all of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.100" end="00:14:22.610" style="s2">and also the toll that it&#39;s taken on him</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.130" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">and his family and friends so I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.610" end="00:14:28.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s shown me the the human</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:30.830" style="s2">vulnerability and it&#39;s been this weird</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.130" end="00:14:33.410" style="s2">kind of like splintering off of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.830" end="00:14:35.390" style="s2">him as a person but then witnessing him</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.410" end="00:14:36.980" style="s2">through media interviews and all these</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.390" end="00:14:38.390" style="s2">different stories people are telling</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.980" end="00:14:39.850" style="s2">about him as kind of a confusing</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.390" end="00:14:41.860" style="s2">experience as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.850" end="00:14:43.660" style="s2">and then to kind of talk about back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.860" end="00:14:47.080" style="s2">your question about have I seen a change</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.660" end="00:14:49.000" style="s2">in Jordan man I mean with all of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.080" end="00:14:53.110" style="s2">interviews of people trying to corner</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.000" end="00:14:56.020" style="s2">him or to kind of criticize them</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.110" end="00:14:58.450" style="s2">unfairly on a mainstream platform I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.020" end="00:15:01.180" style="s2">totally see how it could make somebody</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.450" end="00:15:02.260" style="s2">get really rigid in doing okay well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.180" end="00:15:04.650" style="s2">not gonna I&#39;m not going to give an inch</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.260" end="00:15:07.420" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna make a concession the war</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.650" end="00:15:09.460" style="s2">radicalizes you it hardens up your skin</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.420" end="00:15:11.410" style="s2">it says well fuck it I&#39;m gonna keep my</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.460" end="00:15:12.670" style="s2">cards close to my chest I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.410" end="00:15:14.740" style="s2">give you a concession because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.670" end="00:15:17.550" style="s2">just gonna fuck me over later that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.740" end="00:15:20.530" style="s2">kind of what happened and it was a shame</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.550" end="00:15:23.800" style="s2">because polarization breeds polarization</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.530" end="00:15:25.210" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to blame the guy for</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.800" end="00:15:27.250" style="s2">that because he&#39;s gone through so many</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.210" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">of these interviews and I&#39;ve had just</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.250" end="00:15:32.470" style="s2">the little instances with these mom</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:35.080" style="s2">unfortunately now maybe but you do see</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.470" end="00:15:39.900" style="s2">that hardening I do see yeah I do see</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.080" end="00:15:42.820" style="s2">that kind of like this over emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.900" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">this kind of like a right-wing guy who</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.820" end="00:15:46.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give a shit about you he just</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:47.560" style="s2">wants to use this situation to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.090" end="00:15:48.190" style="s2">liberals look stupid so they could win</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.560" end="00:15:50.380" style="s2">an election</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.190" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">this kind of buddy-buddy thing without</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.380" end="00:15:54.700" style="s2">really being skeptical of this guy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:56.890" style="s2">then on the other hand if a left winger</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.700" end="00:16:00.100" style="s2">sneezes it&#39;s a it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.890" end="00:16:02.680" style="s2">blog post you know so I kind of felt a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.100" end="00:16:05.560" style="s2">little bit of that seeing all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.680" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">content that&#39;s out there and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.560" end="00:16:10.630" style="s2">at the the opening of the film it starts</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:12.700" style="s2">off with this scene of Jordan in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.630" end="00:16:14.680" style="s2">with his family and they&#39;re doing his</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.700" end="00:16:17.020" style="s2">personality test on himself it was in</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.680" end="00:16:18.490" style="s2">its beta mode at that point and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.020" end="00:16:20.050" style="s2">is visibly different it&#39;s before he</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.490" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">changed his diet I think his diet at</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.050" end="00:16:24.610" style="s2">that point was you know fries and Diet</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:26.410" style="s2">Coke I think in between classes there</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.610" end="00:16:29.800" style="s2">was like the fries truck outside that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.410" end="00:16:31.780" style="s2">what I could see him eat but in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.800" end="00:16:34.090" style="s2">scene you just see a lightness to him</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.780" end="00:16:35.620" style="s2">and the way his family teases him and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.090" end="00:16:37.150" style="s2">they joke that&#39;s a lightness that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.620" end="00:16:38.590" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen in Jordan in a long time</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.150" end="00:16:40.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.590" end="00:16:42.250" style="s2">Jordan Peterson described as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.210" end="00:16:45.190" style="s2">one-man lightning rod for the culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.250" end="00:16:46.630" style="s2">war which seems pretty accurate over the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.190" end="00:16:49.030" style="s2">last couple of years what was it like</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.630" end="00:16:51.590" style="s2">for you guys being in the middle of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.030" end="00:16:53.210" style="s2">because I think your</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.590" end="00:16:55.100" style="s2">as you&#39;ve said before you&#39;re from a much</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.210" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">more sort of artistic probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.100" end="00:16:59.060" style="s2">left-leaning background what was that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:02.600" style="s2">like being being in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.060" end="00:17:05.840" style="s2">Maelstrom what did he learn from it so</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.600" end="00:17:08.810" style="s2">much it was hard at first the first year</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.840" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">especially things were so tense in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.810" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">Toronto it was very difficult for me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:16.850" style="s2">get certain people to agree to be part</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:18.380" style="s2">of the film just immediately saying you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.850" end="00:17:20.870" style="s2">know it&#39;s a film about Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.380" end="00:17:22.100" style="s2">well people&#39;s garters are up and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.870" end="00:17:24.290" style="s2">wondering well what are my intentions</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.100" end="00:17:26.780" style="s2">and rightfully so I understand but</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.290" end="00:17:28.730" style="s2">especially when you know the opposition</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.780" end="00:17:31.070" style="s2">side is saying well don&#39;t give him a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.730" end="00:17:32.900" style="s2">platform it&#39;s like a film about it even</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.070" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">if my intentions are to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.900" end="00:17:37.040" style="s2">and try to understand it which they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:39.770" style="s2">and I wasn&#39;t necessarily sympathetic to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.040" end="00:17:41.390" style="s2">everything he was saying it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.770" end="00:17:43.310" style="s2">really matter if the idea is well don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.390" end="00:17:45.500" style="s2">give a platform to the discussion itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.310" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">so that made it really challenging and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.500" end="00:17:49.610" style="s2">being in certain documentary circles it</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:53.240" style="s2">was nerve-wracking to say well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.610" end="00:17:55.010" style="s2">working on the Jordan Peterson film but</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.240" end="00:17:56.660" style="s2">then that started to shift as he became</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.010" end="00:17:58.250" style="s2">more and more popular and gain more</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.660" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">ground and then suddenly all these</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.250" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">filmmakers are flocking to him and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:06.230" style="s2">everybody wants a piece and and then it</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">kind of shifted to you know having to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.230" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">feel kind of like protective about what</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:12.680" style="s2">we were working on and had invested so</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">much into and you know even learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.680" end="00:18:16.730" style="s2">about strange phone calls that took</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:18.350" style="s2">place of people trying to sabotage deals</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.730" end="00:18:20.570" style="s2">we were trying to get to fund the film</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.350" end="00:18:23.830" style="s2">which is it&#39;s so strange because it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.570" end="00:18:27.710" style="s2">also this is my first feature film so</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.830" end="00:18:29.150" style="s2">yeah it was all it was all I guess very</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.710" end="00:18:31.300" style="s2">tumultuous and things were happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.150" end="00:18:32.660" style="s2">very quickly every week there was a new</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.300" end="00:18:36.130" style="s2">drama</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:38.540" style="s2">taking place to try to delve into and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.130" end="00:18:40.280" style="s2">for a while I mean what I thought the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.540" end="00:18:41.690" style="s2">film was about in the first year changed</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.280" end="00:18:43.400" style="s2">from what I thought it was about in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.690" end="00:18:45.860" style="s2">second year and even the third year at</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.400" end="00:18:47.750" style="s2">all it evolved and I guess I let the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.860" end="00:18:50.060" style="s2">story kind of guide me as it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.750" end="00:18:51.770" style="s2">evolving to then figure out okay what</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.060" end="00:18:53.510" style="s2">what are we actually going to focus in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.770" end="00:18:56.270" style="s2">here and when we when it came to editing</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.510" end="00:18:58.820" style="s2">later I realized I probably shot kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.270" end="00:19:00.410" style="s2">three different films because well I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.820" end="00:19:04.750" style="s2">learned how hyper focused you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.410" end="00:19:07.870" style="s2">really be for a film to be cohesive but</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.750" end="00:19:09.909" style="s2">yes it was confusing but I&#39;m so grateful</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.870" end="00:19:12.970" style="s2">for the many things that we learned</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.909" end="00:19:15.549" style="s2">about yeah politically and culturally I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.970" end="00:19:17.650" style="s2">mean that my bubble burst when Trump was</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.549" end="00:19:19.539" style="s2">elected I didn&#39;t see that coming I</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.650" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">didn&#39;t take him seriously so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.539" end="00:19:25.690" style="s2">learned so much about what was taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:27.720" style="s2">place underneath the surface leading to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.690" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">that and it makes so much sense now and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.720" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s um it&#39;s it&#39;s helped my</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:38.380" style="s2">own views to become less superficial in</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:41.110" style="s2">a way where I would never question you</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.380" end="00:19:43.169" style="s2">know things like can empathy go too far</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:47.080" style="s2">I would never question things like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.169" end="00:19:49.809" style="s2">before all of this took place for me</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.080" end="00:19:53.559" style="s2">when I would shock to me I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.809" end="00:19:56.500" style="s2">that much about I just through this</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.559" end="00:19:59.350" style="s2">experience man for a good number of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.500" end="00:20:02.860" style="s2">I just lost so much respect for</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.350" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">progressives they&#39;re so called because</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:08.020" style="s2">I&#39;m some of them yeah some of them you</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:10.210" style="s2">know and because it&#39;s like it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.020" end="00:20:12.400" style="s2">like this reverse racism thing where</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.210" end="00:20:16.929" style="s2">it&#39;s like the taller the whiter the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.400" end="00:20:18.789" style="s2">straighter the person is if if they COFF</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.929" end="00:20:21.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a sign of bigotry you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.789" end="00:20:23.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like this weird thing where</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.090" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like kind of like the last page in</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.530" end="00:20:28.600" style="s2">Animal Farm where it&#39;s like now the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:30.640" style="s2">progressives won when in the heyday they</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.600" end="00:20:33.070" style="s2">were the counter of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:35.650" style="s2">revolutionaries the counterculture we</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.070" end="00:20:37.929" style="s2">have to strive for civil rights but they</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.650" end="00:20:40.470" style="s2">did and they won it just surprised me</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.929" end="00:20:45.030" style="s2">how much they would turn on their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:48.039" style="s2">seemingly their own principles and also</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.030" end="00:20:51.070" style="s2">none of them would speak up against a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.039" end="00:20:53.740" style="s2">more loudmouth version of what they of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.070" end="00:20:57.190" style="s2">their tribe when when one person says</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.740" end="00:20:58.870" style="s2">something kind of crazy nobody says</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.190" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">anything because they&#39;re scared and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.870" end="00:21:04.360" style="s2">don&#39;t want a fish if they&#39;re white they</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:07.419" style="s2">don&#39;t want to come off as racist and but</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.360" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna lean in at the bar later</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.419" end="00:21:10.150" style="s2">on that night lean in with their friends</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:12.669" style="s2">and talk about what they want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.150" end="00:21:14.020" style="s2">about and then some of those people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.669" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">going to end up being Trump supporters</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.020" end="00:21:20.260" style="s2">again like Trump will probably win again</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:22.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.260" end="00:21:24.850" style="s2">because a conservative are just not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.630" end="00:21:26.860" style="s2">progressive should have more options</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.850" end="00:21:29.490" style="s2">than a guy like that but unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.860" end="00:21:34.230" style="s2">they don&#39;t right now and you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.490" end="00:21:39.010" style="s2">Patricia the the filming with Charles</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.230" end="00:21:42.850" style="s2">Joseph the quack-quack right Quaqua yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.010" end="00:21:44.470" style="s2">I&#39;ll let you say that so that that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.850" end="00:21:45.910" style="s2">one of the the main features that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.470" end="00:21:48.520" style="s2">were initially following can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.910" end="00:21:49.990" style="s2">about that what material what attracted</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.520" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">to that story and what material do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.990" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">have that you&#39;d be hoping to put into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:58.300" style="s2">new film so I approached Jordan first in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:22:00.610" style="s2">spring 2015 at the time with an interest</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.300" end="00:22:03.190" style="s2">in making a film about his ideas and his</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.610" end="00:22:05.700" style="s2">work I think the initial film title was</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.190" end="00:22:08.890" style="s2">something like between chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.700" end="00:22:10.840" style="s2">and then as I started to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.890" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">about what was happening in his life he</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.840" end="00:22:14.860" style="s2">told me that he was adding a third story</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:16.570" style="s2">to his home that was being modeled after</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.860" end="00:22:19.090" style="s2">an indigenous longhouse and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.570" end="00:22:20.770" style="s2">okay that&#39;s interesting and I learned</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.090" end="00:22:23.650" style="s2">about his friendship with Charles Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.770" end="00:22:25.720" style="s2">who&#39;s carver who lived in the northern</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.650" end="00:22:28.180" style="s2">part of Vancouver Island and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.720" end="00:22:33.730" style="s2">known each other for about 15 years just</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.180" end="00:22:36.730" style="s2">sort of met at an arts fair yeah but 15</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.730" end="00:22:38.350" style="s2">years ago and it&#39;s developed into this</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.730" end="00:22:40.390" style="s2">really interesting friendship where</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.350" end="00:22:43.540" style="s2">there&#39;s such different people Charles is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.390" end="00:22:45.700" style="s2">this raw artist he he&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.540" end="00:22:47.920" style="s2">residential school survivors so Canada</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:50.380" style="s2">has this dark history of having taken</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.920" end="00:22:51.700" style="s2">Native kids away from their families at</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.380" end="00:22:54.280" style="s2">a young age and put them into</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.700" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">residential schools and many many of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.280" end="00:22:58.090" style="s2">them were sexually abused including</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.890" style="s2">Charles so this happened to him at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.090" end="00:23:02.740" style="s2">age of six and he was in the school for</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.890" end="00:23:06.730" style="s2">eight years so he had this whole life of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:09.480" style="s2">trauma that he was trying to move past</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.730" end="00:23:13.920" style="s2">and he&#39;s still working on that of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.480" end="00:23:16.360" style="s2">and he he never learned how to read</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.920" end="00:23:18.370" style="s2">because of his experience in school and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.360" end="00:23:20.200" style="s2">it&#39;s something that in recent years he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.370" end="00:23:22.900" style="s2">learned how to do and he&#39;s now texting</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.200" end="00:23:25.990" style="s2">us and that sort of thing meanwhile you</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.900" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">have this formerly Harvard professor</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.990" end="00:23:31.910" style="s2">who&#39;s extremely articulate who really in</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:34.100" style="s2">Myers the artistic capacity of Charles</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.910" end="00:23:36.110" style="s2">and how he just lives as this true</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.100" end="00:23:37.700" style="s2">artist and so they complement each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.110" end="00:23:39.740" style="s2">in these interesting ways they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.700" end="00:23:41.870" style="s2">different but they also place an</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.740" end="00:23:45.830" style="s2">interesting emphasis on the dream world</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.870" end="00:23:48.470" style="s2">and the way that the this film which I</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.830" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">intend on going back to make now it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.470" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">for a year and a half I was working on</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">it until Jordan made the videos and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:55.880" style="s2">the rest is history</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">but it&#39;s tentatively called Mahalo which</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.880" end="00:24:00.110" style="s2">is a Kwok will award that&#39;s Charles&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:02.030" style="s2">language and that means to dream so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.110" end="00:24:05.270" style="s2">really want to explore the dream world</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.030" end="00:24:06.919" style="s2">Charles has very vivid dreams tan me as</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.270" end="00:24:08.270" style="s2">Jordan likes to say Tammy dreams for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.919" end="00:24:09.559" style="s2">both of them because Tammy&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.270" end="00:24:11.419" style="s2">that has the vivid dreams and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.559" end="00:24:15.280" style="s2">Jordan links to analyze and interpret</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.419" end="00:24:17.750" style="s2">them and I have this one scene where</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.280" end="00:24:20.870" style="s2">Jordan Tammy and Michaela are talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.750" end="00:24:23.419" style="s2">about a dream a dream Tammy had of there</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.870" end="00:24:28.040" style="s2">was this kind of shamanic character that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.419" end="00:24:29.780" style="s2">was getting away and the person in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.040" end="00:24:34.490" style="s2">dream who Tammy thought was her self but</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.780" end="00:24:37.640" style="s2">Jordan thought with him so that person</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.490" end="00:24:38.870" style="s2">was trying to to catch that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.640" end="00:24:40.280" style="s2">character and it was it was very</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.870" end="00:24:42.410" style="s2">important I think they were getting away</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.280" end="00:24:45.530" style="s2">on a horse or something like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.410" end="00:24:48.500" style="s2">later asked Jordan why do you think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.530" end="00:24:50.750" style="s2">had to catch him and he said because</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.500" end="00:24:53.510" style="s2">otherwise we would we would be losing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.750" end="00:24:58.360" style="s2">our tradition something something to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.510" end="00:25:02.090" style="s2">that effect and so it was so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.360" end="00:25:04.669" style="s2">working on a film that was on that level</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.090" end="00:25:06.950" style="s2">to them how all this political stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.669" end="00:25:10.220" style="s2">happened because it resulted in things</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.950" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">like the month of October in 2016 this</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.220" end="00:25:14.630" style="s2">is this was you know one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:16.190" style="s2">heated points in the controversy where</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.630" end="00:25:17.480" style="s2">the articles were just starting to come</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.190" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">out and journalists were questioning</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.480" end="00:25:20.419" style="s2">Jordan in trying to figure out what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.590" end="00:25:24.049" style="s2">this guy really about and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.419" end="00:25:26.929" style="s2">time Charles and his chief and some</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.049" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">family flew over to Toronto to bless</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.929" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">this space in Jordan&#39;s home and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.630" end="00:25:34.370" style="s2">when naming ceremony took place where</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:38.990" style="s2">Jordan was given his sacred name and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.370" end="00:25:40.610" style="s2">Quoc Willa and it was so strange to to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.990" end="00:25:41.510" style="s2">see those things happening at the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.610" end="00:25:43.190" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.510" end="00:25:46.160" style="s2">he&#39;s been given a name and then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.190" end="00:25:48.650" style="s2">been calling been called other names in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.160" end="00:25:51.980" style="s2">the media at the same time and other</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.650" end="00:25:54.580" style="s2">footage that I have is a really special</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.980" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">potlatch ceremony and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.580" end="00:25:59.720" style="s2">Charles&#39;s family was officially adopting</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:06.290" style="s2">Jordan and his family into his that took</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.720" end="00:26:08.690" style="s2">place in spring 2016 I think it was so</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.290" end="00:26:10.700" style="s2">there&#39;s this big bonfire and the big</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:13.160" style="s2">house and Jordan is kind of dancing</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.700" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">around it being blanketed it was such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.160" end="00:26:19.250" style="s2">different film that we were working on</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:20.780" style="s2">before all of this changed so I intend</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.250" end="00:26:23.570" style="s2">on going back and finishing that film</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.780" end="00:26:25.970" style="s2">once this tour is over at this film I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.570" end="00:26:27.770" style="s2">would say one similarity between the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.970" end="00:26:30.020" style="s2">films though is that they&#39;re both kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.770" end="00:26:32.690" style="s2">of human and honest like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.020" end="00:26:35.210" style="s2">one choice scene it&#39;s it&#39;s so good like</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.690" end="00:26:38.299" style="s2">Patricia&#39;s in the back of the car and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.210" end="00:26:40.190" style="s2">Jordan and Charles are driving to Truth</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.299" end="00:26:44.570" style="s2">and Reconciliation Commission meeting</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.190" end="00:26:46.840" style="s2">which is a an event for talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.570" end="00:26:49.250" style="s2">what happened in residential schools and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.840" end="00:26:53.870" style="s2">Jordan asked Charles what&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.250" end="00:26:56.780" style="s2">hardest thing and Charles says smell the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.870" end="00:26:58.820" style="s2">smell of white people so he would be he</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.780" end="00:27:01.010" style="s2">would be taken to a room called Bible</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.820" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">study you know but there wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.010" end="00:27:04.010" style="s2">Bible in it it&#39;s just this dark room and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:05.960" style="s2">he&#39;s being molested in there so he</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.010" end="00:27:07.309" style="s2">closes his eyes as a little kid and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.960" end="00:27:10.490" style="s2">the other senses are heightened and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.309" end="00:27:13.610" style="s2">would never ever forget the smell of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.490" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">priests and it&#39;s it&#39;s really poignant</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.610" end="00:27:18.200" style="s2">because Jordan is Charles&#39;s first white</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:20.630" style="s2">friend right and they&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.200" end="00:27:24.370" style="s2">super candid moment just very honest</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.630" end="00:27:27.080" style="s2">very raw talking about past trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.370" end="00:27:29.030" style="s2">that&#39;s that I&#39;m really excited about</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:30.440" style="s2">that film because it&#39;s so human it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.030" end="00:27:33.260" style="s2">interesting that you bring up this idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.440" end="00:27:35.690" style="s2">of human because that&#39;s also been an</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.260" end="00:27:39.049" style="s2">interesting shift of going from working</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.690" end="00:27:40.520" style="s2">on mahalo to the rise of jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.049" end="00:27:44.330" style="s2">because it&#39;s like there was this point</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.520" end="00:27:49.010" style="s2">in time where suddenly it was no longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.330" end="00:27:52.250" style="s2">ethical to make a human film and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.010" end="00:27:55.369" style="s2">that was really strange because you felt</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.250" end="00:27:57.259" style="s2">that&#39;s all I felt</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.369" end="00:27:59.570" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know I didn&#39;t feel that but I</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.259" end="00:28:02.119" style="s2">felt like the kind of outside pressures</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.570" end="00:28:06.249" style="s2">of I guess what&#39;s become kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.119" end="00:28:09.109" style="s2">normative documentary culture or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.249" end="00:28:11.720" style="s2">left-of-centre mainstream culture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.109" end="00:28:13.999" style="s2">like like when when I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.720" end="00:28:17.090" style="s2">feedback from certain people in early</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.999" end="00:28:19.639" style="s2">stages of the film who were very much in</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.090" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">opposition to Jordan they didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.639" end="00:28:28.129" style="s2">feeling any sense of appeal to Jordan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:31.340" style="s2">charisma at points in the film or or I</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.129" end="00:28:33.379" style="s2">think - even just taking a liking to his</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.340" end="00:28:35.659" style="s2">human side at any points it was like</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.379" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger to humanizing him</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.659" end="00:28:41.509" style="s2">because then it it softens the the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:44.269" style="s2">of view of know what he did is wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.509" end="00:28:47.359" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a hard line here did you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.269" end="00:28:49.519" style="s2">think that that was right I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.359" end="00:28:51.169" style="s2">was it was confusing and uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.519" end="00:28:53.509" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t think it was right I still</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.169" end="00:28:55.700" style="s2">made a human film and in fact I thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.509" end="00:28:59.330" style="s2">it was even more important to make a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.700" end="00:29:01.999" style="s2">human film because we were so aware of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.330" end="00:29:04.249" style="s2">the culture war being the undercurrent</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.999" end="00:29:07.070" style="s2">throughout all of this and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.249" end="00:29:09.259" style="s2">that so easily lost is the humanity of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.070" end="00:29:10.909" style="s2">all of these people it&#39;s like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.259" end="00:29:13.850" style="s2">see Jordan as a human but we need to see</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.909" end="00:29:16.100" style="s2">his opposition as humans as well and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.850" end="00:29:18.529" style="s2">that was fundamentally very important</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.100" end="00:29:21.049" style="s2">for us to portray all of these people</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.529" end="00:29:24.590" style="s2">with dignity in the film because you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.049" end="00:29:27.350" style="s2">typically just see a YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.590" end="00:29:29.359" style="s2">with a video coming from let&#39;s say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.350" end="00:29:32.119" style="s2">coming from the right and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.359" end="00:29:36.499" style="s2">Jordan is the intelligent hero and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.119" end="00:29:37.940" style="s2">sjw&#39;s are irrational and SJW tears or</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.499" end="00:29:40.639" style="s2">whatever it isn&#39;t like and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.940" end="00:29:42.859" style="s2">you see and what we witnessed was just</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.639" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">so much more complex than that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.859" end="00:29:47.269" style="s2">and you mentioned before that you found</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:50.090" style="s2">it difficult to persuade some people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.269" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">be in the film that&#39;s been a an issue I</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.090" end="00:29:53.570" style="s2">think for a lot of people making films</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:54.950" style="s2">about these kind of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.570" end="00:29:57.409" style="s2">subjects for example I know with</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.950" end="00:29:59.539" style="s2">evergreen Brett Weinstein&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.409" end="00:30:03.049" style="s2">with evergreen it was much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.539" end="00:30:04.609" style="s2">find people on the other side like Brett</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.049" end="00:30:07.399" style="s2">was obviously keen to sell his story and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.609" end="00:30:08.310" style="s2">but it&#39;s often I I know from my</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.399" end="00:30:11.580" style="s2">experiences off</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.310" end="00:30:13.590" style="s2">harder to find people who are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.580" end="00:30:17.010" style="s2">take the other side of that because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.590" end="00:30:18.750" style="s2">see that kind of collaboration with with</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.010" end="00:30:21.060" style="s2">a film about say Jordan Peterson would</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.750" end="00:30:23.370" style="s2">be tantamount to platforming him and all</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.060" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">the rest of it so how was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.370" end="00:30:27.540" style="s2">experience for you trying to get people</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:32.610" style="s2">to go on the record yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.540" end="00:30:35.070" style="s2">definitely difficult but I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.610" end="00:30:40.020" style="s2">persevered through and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.070" end="00:30:42.810" style="s2">helped in the end was trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.020" end="00:30:44.790" style="s2">genuine when asked questions about well</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.810" end="00:30:46.590" style="s2">what&#39;s my own background what&#39;s my own</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.790" end="00:30:48.210" style="s2">interest and what am I trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.590" end="00:30:52.980" style="s2">with the story and I think what also</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.210" end="00:30:55.050" style="s2">helped was that because I didn&#39;t chase</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.980" end="00:30:56.910" style="s2">that story but it was more like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.050" end="00:30:59.550" style="s2">controversy came to me because of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.910" end="00:31:02.700" style="s2">position I was already in I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.550" end="00:31:04.560" style="s2">a strong position on either side well</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.700" end="00:31:06.420" style="s2">you know he&#39;s right about this or you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.560" end="00:31:08.070" style="s2">know I I wasn&#39;t coming at it from a</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.420" end="00:31:10.050" style="s2">political perspective I was coming at it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.070" end="00:31:14.070" style="s2">from a human perspective so it made my</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.050" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">curiosity genuine it made my pursuit to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.070" end="00:31:19.740" style="s2">make sense of what was going on genuine</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:22.830" style="s2">and although I came into it with a big</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.740" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">interest in Jordans ideas I also had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.830" end="00:31:26.580" style="s2">background of being more politically</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:28.980" style="s2">left-of-center so put me in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.580" end="00:31:31.470" style="s2">perfect like conflicting situation where</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.980" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">I could empathize with people from all</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.470" end="00:31:36.900" style="s2">sorts of perspectives coming at this and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:38.910" style="s2">and I thought it was important to really</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.900" end="00:31:41.150" style="s2">ground myself in that even though it</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.910" end="00:31:45.090" style="s2">made it a conflicting and confusing</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.150" end="00:31:48.150" style="s2">process I thought that was important to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.090" end="00:31:53.670" style="s2">give the film integrity and for people</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.150" end="00:31:55.740" style="s2">to see this genuine curiosity in in me</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.670" end="00:31:58.470" style="s2">wanting to listen to them as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.740" end="00:32:01.260" style="s2">just peg them into you know a specific</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.470" end="00:32:04.710" style="s2">side to serve my own agenda and the film</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.260" end="00:32:07.500" style="s2">and has it affected changed your sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.710" end="00:32:09.060" style="s2">political views or cultural views how</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.500" end="00:32:11.220" style="s2">would you wear it wherever you ended up</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.060" end="00:32:14.160" style="s2">at the end of this process yeah I love</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.220" end="00:32:17.070" style="s2">that I love that question okay so for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.160" end="00:32:19.149" style="s2">did you get read pilled yeah for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.070" end="00:32:23.309" style="s2">moment I guess for then I kind of grew</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.149" end="00:32:25.779" style="s2">that for me yeah it was just like look</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.309" end="00:32:27.849" style="s2">challenge some of these left-wing things</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.779" end="00:32:30.429" style="s2">that we just take by default so if</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.849" end="00:32:33.070" style="s2">you&#39;re living in the city you come from</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.429" end="00:32:34.479" style="s2">an immigrant family you turn on TV or</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.070" end="00:32:37.179" style="s2">YouTube or whatever it is and you listen</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.479" end="00:32:39.639" style="s2">to the top people things are generally</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.179" end="00:32:41.229" style="s2">left-leaning okay I guess because they</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.639" end="00:32:44.619" style="s2">won the culture war you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.229" end="00:32:45.759" style="s2">know and sometimes when you&#39;re not when</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.619" end="00:32:49.089" style="s2">you&#39;re doing other things or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.759" end="00:32:51.059" style="s2">politically minded on your own you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.089" end="00:32:55.330" style="s2">take certain points of view as default</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.059" end="00:32:57.159" style="s2">inclusivity diversity inclusion course</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.330" end="00:33:00.129" style="s2">that all sounds lovely and great let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.159" end="00:33:02.589" style="s2">I&#39;ll sign that and where your button you</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.129" end="00:33:06.309" style="s2">know come to your hold up your banner or</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.589" end="00:33:09.249" style="s2">whatever it is at school so this whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.309" end="00:33:10.570" style="s2">thing with Jordan and talking with him</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.249" end="00:33:14.469" style="s2">and with the people that I met through</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.570" end="00:33:16.659" style="s2">him it challenged some of my left evap</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.469" end="00:33:19.149" style="s2">beliefs the shaky ones the superficial</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.659" end="00:33:22.389" style="s2">ones they weren&#39;t even really my beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.149" end="00:33:24.460" style="s2">they were just kind of like rented from</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.389" end="00:33:27.159" style="s2">people that I liked that are charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.460" end="00:33:29.109" style="s2">that are on TV that are make Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.159" end="00:33:31.690" style="s2">films or whatever it is and it just kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.109" end="00:33:33.580" style="s2">of gets compounded over the years and so</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.580" end="00:33:38.859" style="s2">that they&#39;re not your own because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.349" end="00:33:41.830" style="s2">keep saying it and saying it and so but</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.859" end="00:33:44.019" style="s2">but this whole challenge of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.830" end="00:33:47.019" style="s2">being at the border of like the left and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.019" end="00:33:50.499" style="s2">the right I guess from kind of traveling</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.019" end="00:33:52.089" style="s2">between two tribes has shaken out the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.499" end="00:33:54.999" style="s2">more superficial ones are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.089" end="00:33:57.639" style="s2">were never really my ideas you know so</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.999" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">that&#39;s been good I feel more confused</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.639" end="00:34:04.899" style="s2">though but something closer to I want</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:09.010" style="s2">the things that I say to be the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.899" end="00:34:11.379" style="s2">that I do and less about making other</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.010" end="00:34:13.240" style="s2">people happy online or virtual signaling</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.379" end="00:34:16.809" style="s2">or putting something out there to get a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.240" end="00:34:18.520" style="s2">response so that&#39;s been a really good</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.809" end="00:34:21.460" style="s2">evolution for me and I&#39;m really happy it</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.520" end="00:34:25.240" style="s2">happened at the time it did Patricia</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.460" end="00:34:26.559" style="s2">where have you ended up I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.240" end="00:34:29.350" style="s2">sure maybe I would have to do one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.559" end="00:34:31.600" style="s2">those political questionnaires</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.350" end="00:34:34.030" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that I have</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.600" end="00:34:35.590" style="s2">fundamentally shifted too much where I</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.030" end="00:34:38.230" style="s2">am on the spectrum because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.590" end="00:34:43.720" style="s2">my values have changed or my personality</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.230" end="00:34:46.420" style="s2">of course hasn&#39;t changed but I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.720" end="00:34:48.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve just become more open-minded to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.420" end="00:34:51.880" style="s2">understanding where where conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.970" end="00:34:54.010" style="s2">comes from really and being more</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.880" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">open-minded to to listening to that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.010" end="00:34:58.690" style="s2">seeing value in it and I mean I probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:00.910" style="s2">have moved more to the center maybe then</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.690" end="00:35:06.100" style="s2">I was before because I I think had</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.910" end="00:35:08.380" style="s2">become more superficially moved towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.100" end="00:35:10.420" style="s2">the left and an unquestioning and butBut</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.380" end="00:35:13.990" style="s2">I think it&#39;s kind of brought me back to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.420" end="00:35:15.400" style="s2">a place of where I used to be but it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.990" end="00:35:17.380" style="s2">just kind of maybe going along with</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.400" end="00:35:20.770" style="s2">where culture was going without really</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.380" end="00:35:22.630" style="s2">paying attention to it like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:24.250" style="s2">things that going through this the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.630" end="00:35:25.510" style="s2">process of making this film has made me</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.250" end="00:35:28.840" style="s2">think about was back when I was in</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.510" end="00:35:29.890" style="s2">university I was part of a student Club</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.840" end="00:35:32.950" style="s2">that made this magazine called</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.890" end="00:35:35.650" style="s2">perspectives and the goal of it was to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.950" end="00:35:38.020" style="s2">put out a controversial question and ask</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.650" end="00:35:39.850" style="s2">students faculty and staff what do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.020" end="00:35:41.830" style="s2">think about this and why so it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.850" end="00:35:43.960" style="s2">poll it wasn&#39;t like you know yes or no</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.830" end="00:35:46.060" style="s2">what&#39;s your vote it&#39;s like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.960" end="00:35:48.340" style="s2">think and think deeply about why and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.060" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">write it all out so you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.340" end="00:35:53.430" style="s2">and so others can learn about why you</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:56.350" style="s2">think what what you do and then we also</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.430" end="00:35:58.210" style="s2">looked at whatever the question was we</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.350" end="00:36:00.810" style="s2">looked at it from different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.210" end="00:36:03.490" style="s2">so different kind of framing so our</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.810" end="00:36:05.260" style="s2">first issue was about what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.490" end="00:36:07.360" style="s2">about same-sex marriage and why cuz at</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.260" end="00:36:09.610" style="s2">the time this was a big topic in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.360" end="00:36:11.110" style="s2">and and it&#39;s so strange to even think</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.610" end="00:36:12.520" style="s2">about that now cuz I feel like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.110" end="00:36:14.200" style="s2">aging myself like that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.520" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">something that&#39;d be centuries ago and in</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.200" end="00:36:18.790" style="s2">a way it&#39;s it&#39;s embarrassing to even ask</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">like what what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.790" end="00:36:24.070" style="s2">same-sex marriage it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.320" end="00:36:27.820" style="s2">interesting how culture shifts over time</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.070" end="00:36:30.070" style="s2">and when I think about it now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.820" end="00:36:33.130" style="s2">know how a magazine like that would do</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.070" end="00:36:36.220" style="s2">on a campus I mean I know there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.130" end="00:36:38.200" style="s2">clubs forming a lot of them are actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.220" end="00:36:41.250" style="s2">influenced by Jordan Peterson as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.200" end="00:36:44.850" style="s2">seen on this tour that are about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.250" end="00:36:46.710" style="s2">critically and we met this great one in</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.850" end="00:36:48.450" style="s2">New York that was inspired by the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.710" end="00:36:50.430" style="s2">of steel Manning which was used during</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.450" end="00:36:52.500" style="s2">the Jordan Pederson Sam Harris debates</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.430" end="00:36:54.030" style="s2">right like let&#39;s start this off by steel</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.500" end="00:36:58.760" style="s2">Manning your opponent what a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.030" end="00:36:58.760" style="s2">concept it really enables you to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.150" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">understand think through empathize with</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.740" end="00:37:07.680" style="s2">where that other side is coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">and helps you to think more clearly so</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.680" end="00:37:12.420" style="s2">in many ways I think working on this</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:16.470" style="s2">film has brought me back to that place</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.420" end="00:37:18.270" style="s2">that I used to be in and and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.470" end="00:37:21.120" style="s2">like reintegrate parts of myself that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.270" end="00:37:23.370" style="s2">were lost and you mentioned sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.120" end="00:37:25.500" style="s2">impression that you&#39;ve had touring the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.370" end="00:37:26.940" style="s2">film as well how would you summarize the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.500" end="00:37:29.370" style="s2">impact that you think Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.940" end="00:37:30.780" style="s2">has had over the last two years from</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.370" end="00:37:32.760" style="s2">what you&#39;ve seen making the film and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.780" end="00:37:37.470" style="s2">then going and visiting all the places</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.760" end="00:37:39.480" style="s2">that were influenced by his thought so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.470" end="00:37:41.220" style="s2">guess there&#39;s there&#39;s the political</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.480" end="00:37:43.170" style="s2">impact and then there&#39;s the personal</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.220" end="00:37:44.610" style="s2">impact there are some people that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.170" end="00:37:48.780" style="s2">even really interested in the political</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.610" end="00:37:50.610" style="s2">stuff at all aren&#39;t interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.780" end="00:37:51.930" style="s2">hearing about Bill c16 political</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.610" end="00:37:54.360" style="s2">correctness they just love his book</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.930" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">twelve rules for life and they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.360" end="00:37:58.170" style="s2">coming at it from the perspective that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.300" style="s2">guess I was initially coming at it when</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.170" end="00:38:02.850" style="s2">I knew of his work in maps of meaning so</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.300" end="00:38:05.430" style="s2">we found a lot of those people I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.850" end="00:38:10.370" style="s2">say who are just kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.430" end="00:38:15.950" style="s2">interested in those ideas and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.370" end="00:38:17.940" style="s2">Jordan has those people are just so</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.950" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">enthusiastic and kind of willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.940" end="00:38:22.140" style="s2">anything to help just because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:24.410" style="s2">like pulled them out of this stuck state</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.140" end="00:38:28.680" style="s2">that they were in in their lives and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.410" end="00:38:30.150" style="s2">those reactions don&#39;t surprise me even</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.680" end="00:38:31.860" style="s2">seeing the level to which those</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.150" end="00:38:33.840" style="s2">reactions have skyrocketed throughout</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.860" end="00:38:37.500" style="s2">this period because I saw those things</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.840" end="00:38:38.940" style="s2">happening before he became famous at</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.500" end="00:38:40.470" style="s2">public intellectual but they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.940" end="00:38:42.660" style="s2">happening happening at a much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.470" end="00:38:46.200" style="s2">scale but in his class it was when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.660" end="00:38:48.270" style="s2">would go to them in 2014 or 2015</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.200" end="00:38:50.130" style="s2">students would all line up after class</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.270" end="00:38:52.230" style="s2">and crowd around him and just want their</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.130" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">five minutes to ask him a question so</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.230" end="00:38:54.870" style="s2">there was always this depth to the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:57.570" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.870" end="00:38:59.460" style="s2">was talking about that would go to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.570" end="00:39:01.590" style="s2">level that would help people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.460" end="00:39:04.110" style="s2">just have moments of insights and put</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.590" end="00:39:08.220" style="s2">ideas together and and come out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.110" end="00:39:12.390" style="s2">apathy and confusion if it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.220" end="00:39:16.910" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s doing for people with words</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.390" end="00:39:19.770" style="s2">and philosophy what music and art can do</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.910" end="00:39:21.390" style="s2">so so there&#39;s that side of things but</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.770" end="00:39:23.130" style="s2">then there&#39;s of course the people that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.390" end="00:39:24.900" style="s2">are really inspired by him speaking out</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.130" end="00:39:27.750" style="s2">politically I had one comment I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.900" end="00:39:29.940" style="s2">from a student in Texas who said well we</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.750" end="00:39:34.980" style="s2">always there are a lot of films about</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.940" end="00:39:36.300" style="s2">the the the liberal heroes and or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.980" end="00:39:38.220" style="s2">you know the people on the liberal side</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.300" end="00:39:40.470" style="s2">and so thanks for making one about a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.220" end="00:39:44.730" style="s2">conservative oh well that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.470" end="00:39:45.600" style="s2">interesting comment from for me I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.730" end="00:39:47.490" style="s2">of a Fight Club</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.600" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">so when flight club came out I was in</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.490" end="00:39:52.200" style="s2">grade 9 and I remember this one line</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">from that where a generation of men</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.200" end="00:39:57.480" style="s2">raised by our mothers so when we and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">kind of knew this before but when I meet</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.480" end="00:40:01.350" style="s2">them when I met them on tour I was like</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:04.470" style="s2">yes like there&#39;s a lot of guys here that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.350" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">either didn&#39;t have dads or maybe their</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.470" end="00:40:08.520" style="s2">dad was a bit too kind of masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:10.650" style="s2">too hard on them and they didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.520" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">how to talk to their own dad or maybe a</p>

<p begin="00:40:37.010" end="00:40:42.120" style="s2">nice to finally meet them and but yeah</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.060" end="00:40:57.960" style="s2">Jordan has really helped them like they</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.890" end="00:41:01.130" style="s2">because Jordan writes in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.960" end="00:41:03.720" style="s2">accessible you know and that isn&#39;t too</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.130" end="00:41:05.910" style="s2">too heady like maps of meaning is a hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.720" end="00:41:07.380" style="s2">read but 12 rules for life is accessible</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.910" end="00:41:09.789" style="s2">to a lot of guys</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.380" end="00:41:11.530" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s good as I it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.789" end="00:41:14.380" style="s2">really cool to finally meet the people</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.530" end="00:41:17.109" style="s2">that have been influenced so positively</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.380" end="00:41:19.150" style="s2">by Jordans life and by Jordan&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.109" end="00:41:21.849" style="s2">that makes me think of another comment</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.150" end="00:41:25.450" style="s2">we got I think it was also in Texas so</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.849" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">in the poster of the film we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.450" end="00:41:30.220" style="s2">show all the different pieces all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:32.559" style="s2">media all the the people the social</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.220" end="00:41:35.319" style="s2">media all contributing to the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.559" end="00:41:37.780" style="s2">of co-creation of Jordan as the persona</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.319" end="00:41:41.079" style="s2">of Jordan Jordan as this mythological</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.780" end="00:41:42.819" style="s2">figure and in the film we also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.079" end="00:41:44.470" style="s2">have these like chapters headed by</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.819" end="00:41:46.150" style="s2">different stories being told about</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.470" end="00:41:48.069" style="s2">Jordan for the same reason because of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.150" end="00:41:50.530" style="s2">this kind of splintering that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.069" end="00:41:53.230" style="s2">experienced throughout the making of</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.530" end="00:41:54.520" style="s2">this film and kind of like the the you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.230" end="00:41:57.099" style="s2">know there&#39;s Jordan the human and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.520" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">there&#39;s all of this so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.099" end="00:42:02.349" style="s2">figures that we have in the film sorry</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:04.359" style="s2">on the film poster there&#39;s the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.349" end="00:42:06.280" style="s2">of left side and the right side one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.359" end="00:42:08.710" style="s2">the figures on the right side is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.280" end="00:42:12.180" style="s2">person who&#39;s holding a mask of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.710" end="00:42:15.420" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of like the person who</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.180" end="00:42:18.069" style="s2">really admires Jordan and then tries to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.420" end="00:42:20.619" style="s2">tries to be like him tries to speak like</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.069" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">him starts to use his words and but it</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.619" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">gets to a point where he&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:24.849" style="s2">he&#39;s not really in touch with himself</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:27.069" style="s2">and what he even thinks but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.849" end="00:42:28.450" style="s2">imitating Jordan and there was a someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.069" end="00:42:29.799" style="s2">that came up to me after and he said I</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.450" end="00:42:33.609" style="s2">love seeing that on the poster because</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.799" end="00:42:35.650" style="s2">that used to be me and he he eventually</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.609" end="00:42:36.789" style="s2">started to become self aware of it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.650" end="00:42:39.099" style="s2">grew out of it but it was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.789" end="00:42:41.859" style="s2">phase he had to go through and in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.099" end="00:42:44.770" style="s2">growth process of this so it&#39;s it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.859" end="00:42:46.900" style="s2">really cool having someone you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.770" end="00:42:51.309" style="s2">comment and relate to that but then also</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.900" end="00:42:53.589" style="s2">have that that awareness and and growth</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.309" end="00:42:55.329" style="s2">and and be able to have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.589" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">vulnerability to admit and say well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.329" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">I used to be him and it&#39;s not like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">know we&#39;re above what&#39;s on the poster I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:05.079" style="s2">think it&#39;s like there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:06.940" style="s2">everybody in there and everybody has you</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.079" end="00:43:09.430" style="s2">know love or hate Jordan has kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.940" end="00:43:11.940" style="s2">contributed to him exploding into this</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.430" end="00:43:14.620" style="s2">larger-than-life figure</p>
