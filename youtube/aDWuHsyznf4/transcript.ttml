<p begin="00:00:38.210" end="00:00:42.980" style="s2">tonight about is the concept of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.670" end="00:00:45.590" style="s2">digital game something to help people</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.980" end="00:00:47.750" style="s2">maintain their sovereignty and respond</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.590" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">appropriately to the meta crisis if</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:53.180" style="s2">discussion if you&#39;ve been listening to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:54.350" style="s2">anything from Jordan Hall or if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.180" end="00:00:57.170" style="s2">been attending some of these sessions at</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.350" end="00:00:58.610" style="s2">the stoah you may have had this feeling</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.170" end="00:01:01.309" style="s2">of okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.610" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">great there seems to be a lot that I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.309" end="00:01:05.630" style="s2">do right now where do I start and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:07.640" style="s2">you&#39;re like me then maybe you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.630" end="00:01:10.970" style="s2">feeling a little bit overwhelmed maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.640" end="00:01:13.580" style="s2">you&#39;ve had some false starts if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.970" end="00:01:15.500" style="s2">successful with this conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.580" end="00:01:18.289" style="s2">with the group discussion that precedes</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.500" end="00:01:20.509" style="s2">after it then maybe by the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.289" end="00:01:23.750" style="s2">hour we will have a better sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.509" end="00:01:27.140" style="s2">where to start and and how to do so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.750" end="00:01:28.899" style="s2">successfully so to put it really crudely</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.140" end="00:01:30.979" style="s2">I&#39;m going to talk for a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.899" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">hopefully I can get through it in 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.979" end="00:01:34.340" style="s2">minutes and then we&#39;ll have an open</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:37.369" style="s2">discussion and at the end there will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.340" end="00:01:39.470" style="s2">a call to action something that will</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.369" end="00:01:40.580" style="s2">actually allow us to to move forward on</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.470" end="00:01:44.450" style="s2">some of the themes that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.580" end="00:01:46.280" style="s2">here but before getting to that I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.450" end="00:01:48.890" style="s2">want to do say a few points about</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.280" end="00:01:51.259" style="s2">housekeeping so first if you can please</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.890" end="00:01:53.420" style="s2">turn on your video we&#39;re not recording</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.259" end="00:01:54.319" style="s2">the group discussion section of it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.420" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">you can afford a little more</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.319" end="00:01:57.679" style="s2">vulnerability you don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:02:00.709" style="s2">about you know if your room looks ugly</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.679" end="00:02:02.810" style="s2">or something that and it really improves</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.709" end="00:02:06.410" style="s2">the collective vibe and makes it feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.810" end="00:02:08.360" style="s2">more like a digital campfire the second</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.410" end="00:02:10.700" style="s2">thing is use the chat feel free to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.360" end="00:02:12.920" style="s2">a parallel discussion if I say something</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.700" end="00:02:14.180" style="s2">that prompts like an interesting idea or</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.920" end="00:02:15.980" style="s2">a quote or something you want to share</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.180" end="00:02:18.800" style="s2">with everybody else just throw it in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.980" end="00:02:20.989" style="s2">chat if I ask a question feel free to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">respond in the chat and then the final</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.989" end="00:02:26.270" style="s2">thing is make friends so even if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:28.370" style="s2">don&#39;t get any new ideas tonight but you</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.270" end="00:02:30.379" style="s2">have one new relationship that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.370" end="00:02:34.099" style="s2">success and you might be wondering how</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.379" end="00:02:35.959" style="s2">do you do that one technique is if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.099" end="00:02:38.750" style="s2">hear somebody say something that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.959" end="00:02:40.969" style="s2">really like just send them a private</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.750" end="00:02:43.010" style="s2">message in the chat and say I liked what</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.969" end="00:02:44.900" style="s2">you said maybe we can talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.010" end="00:02:46.020" style="s2">further here are my thoughts here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.900" end="00:02:48.180" style="s2">Twitter following</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.020" end="00:02:50.520" style="s2">something like that and maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.180" end="00:02:54.900" style="s2">make some friends on the internet okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.520" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">without further delay I&#39;m gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.900" end="00:03:00.330" style="s2">formulate kind of a summary of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">problem that that we&#39;re currently faced</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.330" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">with so you can think of this as Copa 19</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:06.240" style="s2">you can think of this as the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">I particularly liked one angle that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.240" end="00:03:09.750" style="s2">Jordan Hall had in one of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">situational assessments where he was</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.750" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">talking about how the physical health</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:14.610" style="s2">crisis that started with Kobe 19 is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">quickly turning into a mental health</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.610" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">crisis there&#39;s many aspects to this but</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.240" style="s2">this one was very salient to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">imagine that&#39;s intuitively true for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.240" end="00:03:25.710" style="s2">lot of you but just to highlight a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">things there&#39;s millions of people in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.710" end="00:03:29.730" style="s2">social isolation</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">there&#39;s joblessness loss of income loss</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.730" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">of purpose there&#39;s this collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:35.550" style="s2">breakdown in sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">with a really aggressive news cycle that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.550" end="00:03:39.450" style="s2">is making us afraid and like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:42.090" style="s2">know you know how to tell up from down</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.450" end="00:03:43.740" style="s2">or what to believe and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.090" end="00:03:45.180" style="s2">mortality salience has gone up like</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.740" end="00:03:47.070" style="s2">crazy you know a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.180" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">aren&#39;t used to looking into the void are</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.070" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">now being forced to do so and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.280" end="00:03:54.360" style="s2">surrounded by the most advanced tools of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:57.450" style="s2">escapism ever created</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.360" end="00:04:00.570" style="s2">so like Netflix processed food delivery</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.450" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">pornography social media etc so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.570" end="00:04:07.290" style="s2">one piece on the other end the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.530" end="00:04:09.110" style="s2">desperately needs emergent leaders you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.290" end="00:04:11.610" style="s2">know this is a second side of the coin</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.110" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">we need people more than ever right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.610" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">to be fully deployed we need people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">find a way to grab an aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:25.890" style="s2">dragon&#39;s tail and pull you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:28.610" style="s2">it&#39;s overwhelming so what do we do in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.890" end="00:04:31.099" style="s2">response to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.610" end="00:04:33.110" style="s2">reductionistic approach that I found</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.099" end="00:04:34.729" style="s2">helpful what does it mean to be fully</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.110" end="00:04:36.770" style="s2">deployed I think it&#39;s a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.729" end="00:04:39.770" style="s2">cultivating personal sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.770" end="00:04:41.449" style="s2">giving your best gifts for the current</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.770" end="00:04:44.030" style="s2">moment so we&#39;re gonna explore that a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.449" end="00:04:46.789" style="s2">little bit personal sovereignty is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.030" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">term that you may have heard before I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.789" end="00:04:50.270" style="s2">like this simple definition it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:54.259" style="s2">capacity to be responsive and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.270" end="00:04:57.009" style="s2">reactive an example of a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.259" end="00:04:59.599" style="s2">sovereignty that might all relate to is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.009" end="00:05:01.159" style="s2">if you have an argument with a loved one</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.599" end="00:05:04.099" style="s2">and they say something that is otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.159" end="00:05:05.419" style="s2">benign but for whatever reason you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.099" end="00:05:07.279" style="s2">really your nervous system gets</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.419" end="00:05:08.810" style="s2">activated and you find yourself yelling</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.279" end="00:05:11.960" style="s2">at them or something like that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:13.159" style="s2">reacting there you can imagine that in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.960" end="00:05:17.000" style="s2">moment like this in a moment like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.159" end="00:05:20.180" style="s2">crisis this need is greater than ever so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.000" end="00:05:23.400" style="s2">how do we maintain our responsiveness</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.180" end="00:05:25.350" style="s2">just to kind of contextualize this sorry</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.400" end="00:05:29.040" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna move some zoom stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.350" end="00:05:32.280" style="s2">around a bit personal sovereignty is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.040" end="00:05:33.780" style="s2">foundation for sense making and sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.280" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">making is a foundation for choice making</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.780" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">and choice making is our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:40.200" style="s2">respond to the medic crisis it</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:42.510" style="s2">ultimately comes down to the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.200" end="00:05:44.550" style="s2">our decisions and so if we were not in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.510" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">position of sovereignty then our</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.550" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">decisions are gonna suffer in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">response to the medic crisis is going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">suffer and we all know the stakes are</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:53.130" style="s2">incredibly high</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">so how can we begin to cultivate or</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.130" end="00:05:58.380" style="s2">maintain our personal sovereignty the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.230" style="s2">first step is something incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.380" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">mundane and I don&#39;t think this will be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.230" end="00:06:07.730" style="s2">surprise to many people but you need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.260" end="00:06:09.540" style="s2">begin by managing our physiology and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.730" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2">fundamentals for this have always been</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.540" end="00:06:13.590" style="s2">the same they&#39;ve never changed we need</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.200" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">meditation is probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.470" end="00:06:23.040" style="s2">controversial of the four items there</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">but any kind of mental practice that</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.189" end="00:08:16.349" style="s2">where you click one thing and then next</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.649" end="00:08:18.959" style="s2">thing you know you&#39;re you know you&#39;re on</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.040" end="00:08:26.370" style="s2">practice to respond to these addictions</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.100" end="00:08:28.740" style="s2">I&#39;m calling negations so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.370" end="00:08:32.700" style="s2">negate your addictions such that you up</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.740" end="00:08:36.570" style="s2">regulate your personal sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.700" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">the final one which admittedly is a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:41.130" style="s2">a much more complex discussion and kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.410" style="s2">of beyond the scope of this initial</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.130" end="00:08:45.240" style="s2">presentation is giving your best gifts</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.410" end="00:08:48.150" style="s2">and the thing I&#39;d like to highlight here</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.240" end="00:08:49.770" style="s2">is if we improve our life practices and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.150" end="00:08:51.750" style="s2">if we negate if we become ascetics and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.770" end="00:08:53.490" style="s2">we negate Netflix and YouTube and all</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.750" end="00:08:54.900" style="s2">these things and we up regulate our</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.490" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">personal sovereignty but just do it for</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.900" end="00:08:58.500" style="s2">its own sake it&#39;s like building a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:00.900" style="s2">high-performance vehicle without any</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.500" end="00:09:02.910" style="s2">intention to drive it we basically need</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.900" end="00:09:07.380" style="s2">a direction to energize and justify this</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.910" end="00:09:08.820" style="s2">project we need we need a why and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.380" end="00:09:13.530" style="s2">think what&#39;s interesting about right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.820" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">is that all those big like open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.530" end="00:09:20.300" style="s2">capital P questions about purpose are</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:23.990" style="s2">being forced into something a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.300" end="00:09:25.880" style="s2">urgent so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.990" end="00:09:28.970" style="s2">a lot of people who have been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.880" end="00:09:30.649" style="s2">figure out their wife for years and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.970" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">they&#39;ve done you know a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.649" end="00:09:33.890" style="s2">different practices to try to discern</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.390" end="00:09:36.649" style="s2">that and it seems to be a never-ending</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.890" end="00:09:39.350" style="s2">quest we can&#39;t really afford that right</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.649" end="00:09:41.779" style="s2">now we need to find something a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.350" end="00:09:43.940" style="s2">provisional purpose something that our</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.779" end="00:09:45.830" style="s2">environment immediately demands of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.940" end="00:09:49.430" style="s2">and find a way that we can bring our</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.830" end="00:09:51.470" style="s2">puzzle piece to to fit to that and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.430" end="00:09:53.450" style="s2">that that&#39;s another element that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.470" end="00:09:55.339" style="s2">would say what personal sovereignty is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.450" end="00:09:59.060" style="s2">in service of and that&#39;s her best</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.339" end="00:10:01.100" style="s2">attempt to response the meta-crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.060" end="00:10:03.890" style="s2">if I were to tie all this together in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.100" end="00:10:05.390" style="s2">problem statement I&#39;d say how might we</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.890" end="00:10:07.310" style="s2">cultivate or maintain personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.390" end="00:10:10.430" style="s2">sovereignty and manage our addictions in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.310" end="00:10:12.649" style="s2">the face of the current pandemic beyond</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:14.620" style="s2">this how can we equip ourselves to best</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.649" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">respond to the immediate needs around us</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.620" end="00:10:18.830" style="s2">how do we bring ourselves to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:21.380" style="s2">sustainable state where we are primed</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.830" end="00:10:23.420" style="s2">and ready to give our best gifts for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.380" end="00:10:25.459" style="s2">current moment that is the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.420" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.459" end="00:10:30.199" style="s2">and my hypothesis is that the best way</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:32.749" style="s2">to do this especially in a time of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.199" end="00:10:36.199" style="s2">socialized social isolation is through</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.749" end="00:10:39.800" style="s2">digital mastermind groups these are</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.199" end="00:10:42.709" style="s2">digital gangs that basically people you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.800" end="00:10:45.679" style="s2">can connect with online that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.709" end="00:10:48.050" style="s2">carrier if you show up or not so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.679" end="00:10:49.639" style="s2">not just you alone in your room trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.050" end="00:10:52.339" style="s2">to meditate every morning trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.639" end="00:10:55.189" style="s2">to bed on time there&#39;s there are people</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.339" end="00:10:56.600" style="s2">that actually care about your</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.189" end="00:10:59.059" style="s2">performance here there are people that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.600" end="00:11:00.679" style="s2">care that you are giving your best gifts</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.059" end="00:11:03.579" style="s2">for people that are challenging you</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.260" end="00:11:09.090" style="s2">in order to give you a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.530" end="00:11:14.520" style="s2">power of this I want to kind of give you</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.090" end="00:11:17.370" style="s2">a little visualization exercise these</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.520" end="00:11:18.210" style="s2">are two famous Navy SEALs and I just</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.370" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">want you to imagine you can close your</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:46.650" style="s2">you still haven&#39;t done it just identify</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.660" end="00:11:48.570" style="s2">one of those and just pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.650" end="00:11:50.430" style="s2">any sense of frustration that you have</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.460" end="00:12:08.840" style="s2">and you still have the same habit the</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.840" end="00:12:13.790" style="s2">with Jaco well link and David Goggins</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.940" end="00:12:16.220" style="s2">and they wake up at 5:00 every morning</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.589" end="00:12:36.810" style="s2">feel a little bit easier</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.470" end="00:12:39.270" style="s2">now my sense is that if you&#39;re like most</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.810" end="00:12:41.250" style="s2">people even that visualization kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.270" end="00:12:44.840" style="s2">gives you a clue that there&#39;s something</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.000" end="00:12:58.590" style="s2">made a mistake in thinking that we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.470" end="00:13:01.110" style="s2">do this alone perhaps we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.590" end="00:13:03.770" style="s2">surrounded by people with standards of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.110" end="00:13:08.420" style="s2">excellence people that that can push us</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.770" end="00:13:10.500" style="s2">so to close this up I just want to I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.420" end="00:13:12.060" style="s2">want to present a prototype for what</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.500" end="00:13:13.980" style="s2">this could look like and this is based</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.060" end="00:13:16.680" style="s2">on personal experiences that I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.980" end="00:13:18.600" style="s2">running mastermind groups in person with</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.680" end="00:13:21.090" style="s2">people who live with in the same city as</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.600" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">me and with people who live in different</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.090" end="00:13:27.800" style="s2">time zones people who live you know at</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">other ends of the globe and basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.800" end="00:13:34.920" style="s2">these these will be three weeks Sprint&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:38.190" style="s2">where you have a dedicated period of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.920" end="00:13:40.170" style="s2">time where you&#39;re focused on cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.190" end="00:13:42.210" style="s2">personal sovereignty or giving your best</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.170" end="00:13:43.470" style="s2">gifts there are three weeks because</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.210" end="00:13:45.090" style="s2">they&#39;re long enough to be challenging</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.470" end="00:13:48.960" style="s2">and impactful but not too long to lose</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.090" end="00:13:52.590" style="s2">motivation another hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.960" end="00:13:54.270" style="s2">three members per group is best so in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.590" end="00:13:55.590" style="s2">mind this is the maximum out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.270" end="00:13:58.590" style="s2">accountability with a minimal amount of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.590" end="00:14:00.120" style="s2">risk each additional member starts to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.590" end="00:14:02.460" style="s2">increase the odds that somebody might</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.120" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">drop the ball and that starts to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.460" end="00:14:07.260" style="s2">the wind out of everybody&#39;s sails and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:08.220" style="s2">then you start with three commitments so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.260" end="00:14:10.950" style="s2">going back to what we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.220" end="00:14:13.140" style="s2">before there&#39;s a life practice there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.950" end="00:14:14.940" style="s2">negation and there&#39;s a gift so just to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.140" end="00:14:18.300" style="s2">give you an example life practice could</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.940" end="00:14:20.670" style="s2">be you&#39;re meditating every day negation</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.300" end="00:14:22.790" style="s2">could be you&#39;re quitting YouTube for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.670" end="00:14:26.040" style="s2">three week sprint and a gift could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.790" end="00:14:29.640" style="s2">you are gonna be publishing an article</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.040" end="00:14:32.900" style="s2">every week representing your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.640" end="00:14:35.640" style="s2">on the meta-crisis something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.900" end="00:14:39.180" style="s2">and I think I have a final slide here</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.640" end="00:14:42.450" style="s2">about what this could look like in terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.180" end="00:14:45.240" style="s2">of the tools so yes one way that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.450" end="00:14:47.730" style="s2">done this is weekly housekeeping zoom</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.240" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">calls so once a week and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.730" end="00:14:51.810" style="s2">everybody sets a timer and you have ten</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:53.730" style="s2">minutes to share what went on that week</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.810" end="00:14:56.339" style="s2">and how you did with your life practices</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.730" end="00:14:58.230" style="s2">negations and your gibbets while another</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.339" end="00:15:00.389" style="s2">person jot down notes in a collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.230" end="00:15:01.829" style="s2">Google Doc and then there&#39;s five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.389" end="00:15:03.750" style="s2">for the group to respond so you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.829" end="00:15:05.089" style="s2">source the collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.750" end="00:15:07.589" style="s2">then you switch until you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.089" end="00:15:10.440" style="s2">there&#39;s also a whatsapp group where</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.589" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">everybody can quickly talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.440" end="00:15:14.100" style="s2">or share their struggles throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">week and then there&#39;s some form of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.100" end="00:15:17.670" style="s2">commitment tracking so I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:20.130" style="s2">experience with using Google sheets or</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.670" end="00:15:22.519" style="s2">air table to keep tabs on all those</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.130" end="00:15:26.220" style="s2">habits that you&#39;re trying to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.519" end="00:15:27.750" style="s2">this is an MVP this might work for some</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.220" end="00:15:29.160" style="s2">people and it might be terrible for</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.750" end="00:15:32.180" style="s2">others it might be too structured it</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.160" end="00:15:34.680" style="s2">might be not structured enough but my</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.180" end="00:15:36.870" style="s2">idea here is to kind of throw this out</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.680" end="00:15:38.790" style="s2">at the group and we can now switch to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.870" end="00:15:41.610" style="s2">kind of a group discussion and I can get</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.790" end="00:15:43.050" style="s2">some reactions and maybe people can</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.610" end="00:15:46.740" style="s2">share some of their personal experiences</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.050" end="00:15:49.769" style="s2">and at the end we can talk about what it</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.740" end="00:15:52.139" style="s2">might be like to actually sign up to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.769" end="00:15:53.329" style="s2">something like this in the next three</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.139" end="00:15:56.519" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.329" end="00:15:59.180" style="s2">so with that I&#39;ll switch it over to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.519" end="00:15:59.180" style="s2">Peter</p>
