<p begin="00:02:11.180" end="00:02:15.709" style="s2">this where we&#39;ll go into breakout rooms</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.340" end="00:02:17.480" style="s2">and just talk freely about the different</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.709" end="00:02:19.549" style="s2">ideas that came up in the session so</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.480" end="00:02:27.340" style="s2">looking forward to that as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.549" end="00:02:27.340" style="s2">and with that Justin unmute yourself sir</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.020" end="00:02:33.970" style="s2">manage my time and if it&#39;s not too much</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.350" end="00:02:35.290" style="s2">to ask if you wanted to maybe give me</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.970" end="00:02:37.060" style="s2">like a five-minute warning at the five</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.290" end="00:02:39.340" style="s2">minute mark that would be good but if</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.060" end="00:02:41.740" style="s2">not that&#39;s okay to set it for I&#39;ll set</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.340" end="00:02:43.300" style="s2">it for 20 minutes and that&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.740" end="00:02:48.670" style="s2">know I can have 25 if need be I&#39;ll aim</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.300" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">for 20 that&#39;s great well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.670" end="00:02:53.020" style="s2">I&#39;d like to thank Peter for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:55.690" style="s2">invitation I&#39;m truly grateful and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.020" end="00:02:58.030" style="s2">sincerely happy to be here you know at</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.690" end="00:03:00.459" style="s2">first when Peter invited me I mirrored</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.030" end="00:03:02.860" style="s2">actually because I&#39;ve spoken with Peter</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.459" end="00:03:05.140" style="s2">a couple times privately and he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.860" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">calm and balanced man and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.140" end="00:03:11.470" style="s2">just not I&#39;m prone to terrible bouts of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:13.780" style="s2">enthusiasm and well you know my haters</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.470" end="00:03:16.650" style="s2">would call that narcissism and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.780" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">their right to some degree and frankly</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.650" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">honestly I didn&#39;t want to blemish Peters</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">what I&#39;m sure is a very healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:24.220" style="s2">discussion group here unless I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:25.870" style="s2">confident that I really had something</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.220" end="00:03:28.090" style="s2">valuable to offer and that&#39;s honestly</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.870" end="00:03:31.600" style="s2">why I kind of ignored Peters invitation</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.090" end="00:03:33.730" style="s2">for a few weeks and so then I dragged my</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.600" end="00:03:35.560" style="s2">feet but then an idea came to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.730" end="00:03:38.980" style="s2">emailed Peter and I said let&#39;s do it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.560" end="00:03:41.829" style="s2">so I thought that what I might offer to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.980" end="00:03:44.530" style="s2">a venue called de stoah is a set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.829" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">reflections on a particular lineage or</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.530" end="00:03:48.910" style="s2">tradition within which stoicism sits and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.720" end="00:03:52.510" style="s2">I think it&#39;s not a very well-known</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.910" end="00:03:54.130" style="s2">tradition or lineage in fact as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.510" end="00:03:55.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s never really been formally</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.130" end="00:03:57.400" style="s2">diagnosed in any published literature</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.720" end="00:04:00.269" style="s2">that I&#39;m aware of so I will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.400" end="00:04:02.230" style="s2">presenting a somewhat novel or original</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.269" end="00:04:05.410" style="s2">hypothesis today and I only have 20</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.230" end="00:04:08.530" style="s2">minutes so needless to say it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.410" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">be limited to hypotheses and assertions</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.530" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">which I&#39;m not going to be able to fully</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:13.570" style="s2">convinced you of or fully justify but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">can at least lay them out there for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.570" end="00:04:18.850" style="s2">and you can take them or leave them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:21.039" style="s2">we can discuss them and so I would call</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.850" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">this tradition or lineage the cynical</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.039" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">enlightenment although really we should</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">spell that with a K and not a C this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.229" style="s2">a very confusing set point which I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:31.180" style="s2">get bogged down in but basically the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.229" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">term cynicism as we know it today means</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.180" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">something totally different than what</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:35.110" style="s2">I&#39;m going to talk about it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">with the kind of weird kind of</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.770" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">and in the way that that&#39;s used today so</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.300" end="00:05:33.550" style="s2">simply what I take to be the main thesis</p>

<p begin="00:09:33.690" end="00:09:39.930" style="s2">community okay and so the final</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.500" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">implication of this perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.930" end="00:09:48.510" style="s2">ergo one should live and act or at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">some people within society and perhaps a</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.180" end="00:10:01.380" style="s2">is rather radically antisocial and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:04.860" style="s2">have to do that in a way that involves</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.860" end="00:10:08.900" style="s2">is this realization running from</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.900" end="00:10:14.580" style="s2">Western left liberalism in kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.860" end="00:11:21.160" style="s2">rapid fire through some</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.440" end="00:11:23.450" style="s2">the milestones in this tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.160" end="00:11:25.340" style="s2">maybe before I do that very briefly I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.450" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">want to just point out one other little</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.340" end="00:11:30.200" style="s2">watchword if you will of this tradition</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">a particular concept that you actually</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:38.030" style="s2">going to kind of piece it together for</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.030" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked about this a few time given</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.590" end="00:11:43.250" style="s2">some talks on this I&#39;ve written about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.250" end="00:11:46.430" style="s2">very interested in for a long time this</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.630" end="00:11:48.890" style="s2">this is a Greek word and it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.430" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">translated into English as Frank speech</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.890" end="00:11:54.050" style="s2">and by the way there&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:55.520" style="s2">book by Foucault probably fucose the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.050" end="00:11:57.290" style="s2">best book by Foucault is called the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.520" end="00:11:59.720" style="s2">courage of truth and it&#39;s pretty much an</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.720" end="00:12:05.030" style="s2">presenting in the ancient world and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.230" end="00:12:07.250" style="s2">this is kind of the watchword that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.030" end="00:12:09.560" style="s2">actually was used by multiple people in</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.560" end="00:12:13.820" style="s2">you about Diogenes also had a similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.960" end="00:12:15.130" style="s2">concept called defacing the currency</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.820" end="00:12:17.570" style="s2">I think it&#39;s essentially the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.130" end="00:12:19.100" style="s2">okay and I talked actually at some</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.570" end="00:12:21.500" style="s2">length in other talks and I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.100" end="00:12:23.450" style="s2">also a little bit about the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.500" end="00:12:25.610" style="s2">of prea like what exactly is required</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.450" end="00:12:26.990" style="s2">for priests yet to function I talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.610" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">about this and the base tool is lectures</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.990" end="00:12:30.080" style="s2">for instance so I&#39;m not going to go into</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">that here I&#39;m gonna focus on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.080" end="00:12:36.680" style="s2">expanding out the the historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:39.110" style="s2">narrative okay so so it all starts with</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.680" end="00:12:41.240" style="s2">Socrates in my understanding most of you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.110" end="00:12:43.970" style="s2">know that the famous stories of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.240" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">this is required reading and in many</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.970" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">universities say you we all know that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:50.660" style="s2">Socrates was put to trial for corrupting</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:52.400" style="s2">the youth and you know Socrates MO was</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.660" end="00:12:54.020" style="s2">he what did he do he walked around and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.400" end="00:12:55.700" style="s2">asked people really annoying questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.020" end="00:12:57.110" style="s2">all of the fucking time and he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.700" end="00:12:59.240" style="s2">stop they called him a gadfly and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.110" end="00:13:01.130" style="s2">ultimately you know if you simply go</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.240" end="00:13:03.230" style="s2">around society asking difficult</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.130" end="00:13:04.970" style="s2">questions a little too frequently that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.230" end="00:13:06.980" style="s2">really does become a crime that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.970" end="00:13:08.570" style="s2">of the lesson of Socrates it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.980" end="00:13:09.890" style="s2">interesting that it ultimately gets</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.570" end="00:13:11.900" style="s2">diagnosed that&#39;s corrupting the youth</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.890" end="00:13:12.770" style="s2">which is actually somewhat you know we</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.900" end="00:13:13.900" style="s2">can that we can think of some</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.770" end="00:13:17.660" style="s2">interesting kind of contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.900" end="00:13:21.050" style="s2">analogies to that it&#39;s like I won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.660" end="00:13:23.390" style="s2">into that but um yeah so so if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.050" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">too many questions too annoyingly you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.390" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">you actually really are a kind of Public</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:28.130" style="s2">Enemy</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:30.690" style="s2">and as we see in the case of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.130" end="00:13:33.540" style="s2">that is often weirdly linked to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.690" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">to some sort of touching some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.540" end="00:13:37.800" style="s2">sacred thing and and and the youth has</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:40.170" style="s2">always been a kind of sacred space that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.800" end="00:13:42.120" style="s2">that no reasonable adult should show to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.170" end="00:13:45.000" style="s2">have anything to do with corrupting the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.120" end="00:13:47.250" style="s2">youth right so that Socrates right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.000" end="00:13:49.129" style="s2">obvious we all know that story so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.250" end="00:13:51.480" style="s2">an obvious kind of form of parisa and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.129" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">people hated him for it and and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.480" end="00:13:56.790" style="s2">essentially put him to death for it um a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:13:59.129" style="s2">lesser known figure in the in the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.790" end="00:14:01.290" style="s2">Golden Age of ancient Greece is Diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.129" end="00:14:02.879" style="s2">biology&#39;s is this amazing extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.290" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">character many of you might have heard</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.879" end="00:14:06.569" style="s2">me talk about him elsewhere he basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.160" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">engaged in these kind of extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.569" end="00:14:12.089" style="s2">provocative public acts he he basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:13.259" style="s2">acted like an animal and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.089" end="00:14:14.579" style="s2">quite bizarre if you look over the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.259" end="00:14:16.889" style="s2">anecdotes the types of things he would</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.579" end="00:14:19.310" style="s2">do like masturbate in public or you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.889" end="00:14:21.509" style="s2">he one time took a shit on the stage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.310" end="00:14:23.790" style="s2">what we&#39;re essentially the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.509" end="00:14:26.519" style="s2">Olympic Games at that time in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.790" end="00:14:28.050" style="s2">Greece and he basically was what we</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.519" end="00:14:29.819" style="s2">would now today call a performance</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.050" end="00:14:32.519" style="s2">artist I mean just a wild man who would</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.819" end="00:14:34.920" style="s2">go out doing extremely weird provocative</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.519" end="00:14:36.449" style="s2">things just to prove a point</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.920" end="00:14:37.829" style="s2">really and he also lived a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.449" end="00:14:39.300" style="s2">life so he kind of put his money where</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.829" end="00:14:43.259" style="s2">his mouth was he lived out of a barrel</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.300" end="00:14:46.199" style="s2">and had very few needs really kind of he</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.259" end="00:14:49.019" style="s2">ate very simply he relied on nothing had</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.199" end="00:14:50.759" style="s2">almost no objects or belongings and was</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.019" end="00:14:52.680" style="s2">very isolated socially also so he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.759" end="00:14:55.290" style="s2">have many friends but he was able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.680" end="00:14:56.730" style="s2">kind of speak the truth but not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.290" end="00:14:58.259" style="s2">speak the truth lived the truth in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.730" end="00:14:59.699" style="s2">kind of provocative way and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.259" end="00:15:02.009" style="s2">the best way to understand Diogenes is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.699" end="00:15:04.110" style="s2">that his target was kind of budva</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.009" end="00:15:05.670" style="s2">hypocrisy right because you know ancient</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.110" end="00:15:07.560" style="s2">Greece is kind of the the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.670" end="00:15:09.540" style="s2">Western civilization as we know it so</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.560" end="00:15:11.970" style="s2">there are starting to emerge some some</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.540" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">comforts right some luxuries and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.970" end="00:15:15.899" style="s2">lifestyle comforts and with that with</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">kind of booze walk comfort there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.899" end="00:15:20.579" style="s2">always hypocrisy and he was basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">trying to call out Greek society on on</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.579" end="00:15:23.220" style="s2">its hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:25.139" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s worth pausing for a minute if</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.220" end="00:15:27.420" style="s2">that&#39;s not absolutely obvious what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.139" end="00:15:29.160" style="s2">mean by how hypocrisy or falsehood is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.420" end="00:15:30.509" style="s2">kind of baked into civilization itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.160" end="00:15:32.459" style="s2">I&#39;ll pause on that real quick I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.509" end="00:15:33.750" style="s2">the best way to think about that is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.459" end="00:15:36.180" style="s2">the concept of manners right what are</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.750" end="00:15:38.459" style="s2">manners manners are essentially a kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.180" end="00:15:40.380" style="s2">of deception where you actively try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.459" end="00:15:42.360" style="s2">present yourself in a way that is other</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.380" end="00:15:43.980" style="s2">than what you naturally are inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.360" end="00:15:44.579" style="s2">present yourself right so it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.980" end="00:15:49.709" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.579" end="00:15:52.889" style="s2">really it&#39;s kind of subliminal did how</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.709" end="00:15:54.660" style="s2">should I say kind of diffuse diffuse</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.889" end="00:15:56.850" style="s2">form of lying essentially and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.660" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">kind of attacking Western hypocrisy at</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.850" end="00:16:01.290" style="s2">its core when were first starting to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:04.230" style="s2">develop these kind of pretenses and kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.290" end="00:16:06.239" style="s2">of bodily forms of lying okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:07.379" style="s2">he&#39;s just attacking his and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.239" end="00:16:09.420" style="s2">a true philosopher does just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.379" end="00:16:11.579" style="s2">Socrates asked too many questions</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.420" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">he refused to refuse to stop and search</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.579" end="00:16:15.179" style="s2">with the truth same thing with Diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:17.009" style="s2">but Diogenes took it to a new level</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.179" end="00:16:19.139" style="s2">because for him it was performative he</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.009" end="00:16:20.999" style="s2">was actually engaging in in activities</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.139" end="00:16:22.829" style="s2">that were performative ly provocative so</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.999" end="00:16:25.559" style="s2">I see it Diogenes is kind of learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.829" end="00:16:26.779" style="s2">from the mistake of Socrates Diogenes is</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.559" end="00:16:28.799" style="s2">like I&#39;m not gonna get put to death for</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.779" end="00:16:30.209" style="s2">asking the youth too many questions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.799" end="00:16:31.350" style="s2">just gonna do crazy a shit and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.209" end="00:16:33.239" style="s2">gonna get the point across whether they</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.350" end="00:16:35.069" style="s2">like it or not and it&#39;s harder to punish</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.239" end="00:16:36.929" style="s2">them for and in fact Diogenes was really</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.069" end="00:16:38.339" style="s2">quite clever because there actually was</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.929" end="00:16:39.749" style="s2">a real political advantage to his</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.339" end="00:16:42.089" style="s2">techniques relative to Socrates because</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.749" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">not only did Diogenes avoid getting put</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.089" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">to death like Socrates unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:48.869" style="s2">failed to avoid but he was quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.189" style="s2">powerful because of it Alexander the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.869" end="00:16:51.779" style="s2">Great for instance is famous for having</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.189" end="00:16:54.540" style="s2">said that if he could not be Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.779" end="00:16:56.279" style="s2">he would wish to be Diogenes so rather</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.540" end="00:16:58.699" style="s2">extraordinary right so it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.279" end="00:17:01.589" style="s2">testimony to that the real empirical</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.699" end="00:17:02.879" style="s2">mechanisms of apprecia as actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.589" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">political activity that really does</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.879" end="00:17:07.949" style="s2">change distributions of power in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:11.669" style="s2">certain way okay and so next up comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.949" end="00:17:13.130" style="s2">Jesus Christ and the Stoics which are</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.669" end="00:17:16.470" style="s2">you know both both of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.130" end="00:17:17.789" style="s2">phenomena are very close in time so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.470" end="00:17:20.339" style="s2">a little difficult actually to tease out</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.789" end="00:17:21.750" style="s2">which is causing which but one thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.339" end="00:17:23.789" style="s2">that you all might know about the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.750" end="00:17:26.370" style="s2">is that or you might not know is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.789" end="00:17:29.370" style="s2">the stoicism is one way to understand so</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.370" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">stoicism as it emerges is that it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.370" end="00:17:36.090" style="s2">of a kind of amused waz Amal is one way</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:39.230" style="s2">of putting it of cynicism of ancient</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.090" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">cynicism a kind of becoming bushwa of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.230" end="00:17:43.260" style="s2">ancient cynicism because as you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:44.070" style="s2">people the great Stoics like people like</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.260" end="00:17:46.260" style="s2">Marcus Aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.070" end="00:17:47.940" style="s2">these were governors right these Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.260" end="00:17:51.330" style="s2">Aurelius was was a Roman Emperor</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.940" end="00:17:54.270" style="s2">and in stoicism was a kind of polished</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.330" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">up cleaned up version of what Diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.270" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">really introduced with cynicism and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:17:59.110" style="s2">that&#39;s well documented in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:01.300" style="s2">it&#39;s not just me saying that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.110" end="00:18:04.420" style="s2">clear kind of inheritance there okay but</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.300" end="00:18:06.220" style="s2">the main difference being that it Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.420" end="00:18:08.830" style="s2">really some people like that fit the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.220" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">insight of Diogenes in a way that works</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.830" end="00:18:13.870" style="s2">for rulers and governors okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:15.790" style="s2">that&#39;s an important little mutation</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.870" end="00:18:17.050" style="s2">there but Jesus Christ also is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.790" end="00:18:18.580" style="s2">essentially participating in the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.050" end="00:18:20.650" style="s2">tradition and there&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.580" end="00:18:23.140" style="s2">passage in the Gospels of Mark for</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.650" end="00:18:26.560" style="s2">instance where Jesus actually uses the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.140" end="00:18:28.510" style="s2">word parousia um he it&#39;s when he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.560" end="00:18:31.570" style="s2">basically at the time I think it&#39;s Peter</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.510" end="00:18:33.220" style="s2">at the time is saying to Jesus hey you</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.570" end="00:18:34.570" style="s2">know we like your message and all but</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.220" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">you maybe don&#39;t need to run around</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.570" end="00:18:38.890" style="s2">letting all of the governors here are</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:40.900" style="s2">you saying that right because you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.890" end="00:18:42.790" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna kill you right so Peters</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.900" end="00:18:43.960" style="s2">kind of like you can say all this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.790" end="00:18:45.370" style="s2">great you should develop this and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.960" end="00:18:47.260" style="s2">should organize around this great idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.370" end="00:18:48.940" style="s2">you have Jesus but maybe just don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.260" end="00:18:51.490" style="s2">out of your way to let the government</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.940" end="00:18:53.050" style="s2">hear you sang it and what Jesus says in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.490" end="00:18:54.610" style="s2">response is no that&#39;s part of the point</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.050" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the project here and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.610" end="00:18:59.260" style="s2">invokes this word parisi uh so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:00.910" style="s2">really it&#39;s really quite fascinating I I</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.260" end="00:19:03.900" style="s2">really do think there&#39;s gospel evidence</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.910" end="00:19:06.520" style="s2">that Jesus had some kind of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.900" end="00:19:08.440" style="s2">kind of conscious participation in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.520" end="00:19:10.840" style="s2">lineage that goes from Socrates to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.440" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">Diogenes up to Jesus and the stoat and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.840" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2">the Stoics and and and of course people</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:17.020" style="s2">like Marcus Aurelius I&#39;m quite confident</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:18.550" style="s2">would have some sort of awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.020" end="00:19:19.240" style="s2">this tradition but they were governors</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.550" end="00:19:20.470" style="s2">and they have to kind of make it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.240" end="00:19:23.260" style="s2">respectable and and and they they</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.470" end="00:19:27.160" style="s2">significantly modified the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.260" end="00:19:29.080" style="s2">implications of ancient kinases &#39;m for</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.160" end="00:19:31.690" style="s2">you know to make it fit for rulers okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.080" end="00:19:34.570" style="s2">so just to kind of move forward a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.690" end="00:19:35.890" style="s2">bit more rapidly and this is where my</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.570" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">diagnosis i think becomes somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.890" end="00:19:39.610" style="s2">idiosyncratic this is where maybe a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:41.740" style="s2">of scholars who are very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.610" end="00:19:43.060" style="s2">these different historical periods might</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.740" end="00:19:45.460" style="s2">kind of raise their eyebrows at me so</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.060" end="00:19:47.530" style="s2">I&#39;ll just give you that kind of honest</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.460" end="00:19:48.430" style="s2">caveat there but then again that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.530" end="00:19:51.610" style="s2">part you have to keep in mind because</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.430" end="00:19:53.920" style="s2">just very few scholars do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.610" end="00:19:55.450" style="s2">truly kind of cross historical type of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.920" end="00:19:57.960" style="s2">analysis so I&#39;m just being honest with</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.450" end="00:20:00.220" style="s2">you that I&#39;m not aware of any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.960" end="00:20:01.630" style="s2">scholarship that at the at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.220" end="00:20:04.100" style="s2">supports what I&#39;m saying but I&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.630" end="00:20:06.139" style="s2">the case to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.100" end="00:20:07.879" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna fast forward a lot in part</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.139" end="00:20:10.429" style="s2">because of my own historical blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.879" end="00:20:12.499" style="s2">I I don&#39;t I&#39;m not very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.429" end="00:20:15.470" style="s2">much work from from the Middle Ages and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.499" end="00:20:17.299" style="s2">the Dark Ages but one figure I am quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.470" end="00:20:20.179" style="s2">familiar with is jean-jacques Rousseau</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.299" end="00:20:22.879" style="s2">and I see Rousseau as this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.179" end="00:20:24.859" style="s2">extraordinary reinvention of this parisi</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.879" end="00:20:26.989" style="s2">astok tradition I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.859" end="00:20:28.789" style="s2">you know about Russo&#39;s life but a truly</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.989" end="00:20:30.470" style="s2">truly extraordinary intellectual figure</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.789" end="00:20:31.999" style="s2">and say what you want about his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.470" end="00:20:34.970" style="s2">and whether they&#39;re true or false or</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.999" end="00:20:36.590" style="s2">good or bad but as as a biography he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.970" end="00:20:39.070" style="s2">an extraordinary example of a truly</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.590" end="00:20:41.809" style="s2">committed radical intellectual a man who</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.070" end="00:20:43.909" style="s2">clearly was going to give his whole life</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.809" end="00:20:46.249" style="s2">to thinking the truth as well as he</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.909" end="00:20:48.379" style="s2">could and expressing it as fearlessly</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.249" end="00:20:50.599" style="s2">and as radically and in a political way</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.379" end="00:20:52.849" style="s2">as he possibly could no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.599" end="00:20:55.639" style="s2">might befall him he basically spent most</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.849" end="00:20:59.259" style="s2">of his life on the run from various</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.639" end="00:21:01.519" style="s2">governments actually and often in debt</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.259" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">you know had this kind of really wild</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.519" end="00:21:04.999" style="s2">life where he basically just always</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.200" style="s2">prioritized his ideas developing his</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.999" end="00:21:07.789" style="s2">ideas and publishing his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.200" end="00:21:09.739" style="s2">constantly getting into trouble for them</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.789" end="00:21:12.289" style="s2">and constantly running away from whoever</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.739" end="00:21:13.639" style="s2">was out to get him often you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.289" end="00:21:15.979" style="s2">talking about like actual kings and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.639" end="00:21:17.179" style="s2">queens of multiple countries he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.979" end="00:21:18.889" style="s2">banned for multiple countries and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.179" end="00:21:22.369" style="s2">and he was wanted by multiple</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.889" end="00:21:24.049" style="s2">authorities and so without going into</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.369" end="00:21:25.849" style="s2">Rousseau his ideas too much we&#39;ll all</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.049" end="00:21:27.409" style="s2">I&#39;ll say is that if you look at how he</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.849" end="00:21:30.710" style="s2">practiced his ideas and many things he</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.409" end="00:21:32.840" style="s2">said also his autobiography in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.710" end="00:21:34.070" style="s2">particular Rousseau you might not know</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.840" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">this basically invented the modern</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.070" end="00:21:38.450" style="s2">autobiography it wasn&#39;t really a thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:41.299" style="s2">until until the idea of setting out on</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.450" end="00:21:43.369" style="s2">paper a long series of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.299" end="00:21:45.169" style="s2">comprehensive soul-searching reflections</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.369" end="00:21:46.879" style="s2">about one&#39;s life no one ever really did</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.169" end="00:21:50.330" style="s2">that and he and he did it in this big</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.879" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">way and he went specifically hard on</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.330" end="00:21:53.659" style="s2">trying to find things that were</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">embarrassing things that were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.659" end="00:21:58.220" style="s2">shameful and of course another another</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:21:59.989" style="s2">example would be a st. Augustine right</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.220" end="00:22:01.700" style="s2">who&#39;s kind of known for also talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.989" end="00:22:03.379" style="s2">about things like masturbating right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.700" end="00:22:05.899" style="s2">so there are other kind of figures I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.379" end="00:22:07.970" style="s2">skipping a little bit but Rousseau had</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.899" end="00:22:10.580" style="s2">seem to have this insight that if he</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:12.169" style="s2">could simply be as radically honest</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.580" end="00:22:13.820" style="s2">about himself as possible if he could</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.169" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">find all of his own hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.820" end="00:22:17.299" style="s2">all of his own evil by essentially</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:20.179" style="s2">introspection and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.299" end="00:22:24.019" style="s2">and basically just shamelessly and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.179" end="00:22:25.369" style="s2">selflessly laying bare all that is kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.019" end="00:22:27.710" style="s2">of evil in his own feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.369" end="00:22:28.909" style="s2">aspirations and psychology he had this</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.710" end="00:22:31.039" style="s2">idea that that would be kind of so</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.909" end="00:22:33.379" style="s2">explosive that it could really lead to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.039" end="00:22:34.909" style="s2">cultural progress rapidly that it could</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.379" end="00:22:36.350" style="s2">have revolutionary political</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.909" end="00:22:38.629" style="s2">implications for making the world more</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.350" end="00:22:41.149" style="s2">equal and more free and and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.629" end="00:22:42.619" style="s2">actually works I mean again I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.149" end="00:22:44.059" style="s2">interested in peer achill mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.619" end="00:22:47.029" style="s2">if you look at the influence of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.059" end="00:22:48.739" style="s2">it was extraordinary right oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.029" end="00:22:49.179" style="s2">about that so I&#39;ll finish up in five</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.739" end="00:22:51.559" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.179" end="00:22:52.460" style="s2">at five minutes max I mean I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.559" end="00:22:56.600" style="s2">be quicker than that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.460" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">and so Rousseau has this kind of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.600" end="00:23:03.049" style="s2">idea and lives this crazy life of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:04.789" style="s2">philosophical kind of self punishing in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.049" end="00:23:06.859" style="s2">some way and it actually does have</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.789" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">profound effects because lo and behold</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.859" end="00:23:11.570" style="s2">the French Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:14.179" style="s2">is well documented as as flowing in in</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.570" end="00:23:15.559" style="s2">large part from the ideas of of Rousseau</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.179" end="00:23:17.629" style="s2">many of the leading French</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.559" end="00:23:19.519" style="s2">revolutionaries were in fact influenced</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.629" end="00:23:23.330" style="s2">by Rousseau and and there&#39;s documentary</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.519" end="00:23:25.789" style="s2">evidence of this okay so in some ways in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.330" end="00:23:27.739" style="s2">some ways what I&#39;m talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.789" end="00:23:30.289" style="s2">really not just abstract ideas it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.739" end="00:23:32.929" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of mental model of how</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.289" end="00:23:34.909" style="s2">public philosophy works that as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.929" end="00:23:37.279" style="s2">can tell in history actually does</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.909" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">produce real ripple ripples in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.279" end="00:23:40.970" style="s2">social fabric okay and and and Rousseau</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.249" style="s2">is just kind of one of the more recent</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.970" end="00:23:45.080" style="s2">kind of modern examples in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.249" end="00:23:46.879" style="s2">Rousseau kind of opens up the modern</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.080" end="00:23:48.409" style="s2">period culturally and politically okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.879" end="00:23:50.179" style="s2">and so I&#39;m gonna just really</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.409" end="00:23:51.559" style="s2">fast-forward through through the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.179" end="00:23:54.409" style="s2">few but just to put it on the map for</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.559" end="00:23:56.330" style="s2">you I many of you will know that I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.409" end="00:23:58.789" style="s2">the time quite interested in ile de luz</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.330" end="00:24:00.710" style="s2">and I think in his own interesting weird</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.789" end="00:24:03.379" style="s2">way des loves is also participating in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.710" end="00:24:05.749" style="s2">this tradition because de las actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.379" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">was quite interested in stoicism and he</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.749" end="00:24:11.779" style="s2">cites the Stoics quite frequently in his</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">in many of his books actually and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.779" end="00:24:15.950" style="s2">talked about in my book on Dilla&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">talked about his interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.950" end="00:24:18.859" style="s2">relationship to Christianity I think de</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:21.289" style="s2">les is actually much more Christian than</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.859" end="00:24:23.149" style="s2">people realize as I&#39;m saying now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.289" end="00:24:25.879" style="s2">more stoic than than many people realize</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.149" end="00:24:27.619" style="s2">and finally I would argue that the kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.879" end="00:24:29.090" style="s2">of 1968 moment for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.619" end="00:24:30.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know 1968 was this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.090" end="00:24:32.290" style="s2">extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.070" end="00:24:33.580" style="s2">period millions of people went on</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.290" end="00:24:36.610" style="s2">general strike in France for instance</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.580" end="00:24:39.310" style="s2">and a lot of people in 1968 genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.610" end="00:24:42.030" style="s2">believed that Western Western societies</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.310" end="00:24:44.020" style="s2">were actually going through legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.030" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">economic and political social</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.020" end="00:24:49.930" style="s2">revolutions and I would argue that there</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:52.660" style="s2">is to this day a kind of latent left</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.930" end="00:24:54.610" style="s2">libertarian revolutionary politics that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.660" end="00:24:56.860" style="s2">has not really been fully explored yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.610" end="00:24:58.870" style="s2">this is my politics that I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.860" end="00:25:01.630" style="s2">and this is as far as I see the world as</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.870" end="00:25:03.940" style="s2">far as my beliefs go my politics are my</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.630" end="00:25:05.500" style="s2">ideology I mean I think intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.940" end="00:25:07.060" style="s2">should try to have no ideology but to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.500" end="00:25:08.740" style="s2">the degree that I have won to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.060" end="00:25:12.490" style="s2">I have a politics it&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:16.930" style="s2">subterranean hiding latent radical left</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.490" end="00:25:18.190" style="s2">libertarian parisi astok politics and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.930" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">think you can draw a straight line from</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.190" end="00:25:22.210" style="s2">Socrates all the way up through all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:25.150" style="s2">these people to envision what it might</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.210" end="00:25:27.100" style="s2">look like for us to speak and think and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.150" end="00:25:29.980" style="s2">live and act in a way that has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.100" end="00:25:32.740" style="s2">left libertarian flavor or style but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.980" end="00:25:34.630" style="s2">essentially seizes on parisa as a form</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.740" end="00:25:36.190" style="s2">of revolutionary political action and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.630" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">that to this day is what I&#39;m mostly</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.190" end="00:25:40.180" style="s2">interested in and in my own way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:41.740" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the the philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.180" end="00:25:46.930" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to figure out and live with</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.740" end="00:25:50.770" style="s2">my own life thank you so much excellent</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.930" end="00:25:53.290" style="s2">thank you very dense and super exciting</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.770" end="00:25:55.330" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna invite people to put their</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.290" end="00:25:57.400" style="s2">questions in the chat I just initially</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.330" end="00:25:59.380" style="s2">would love for you to kind of break</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.400" end="00:26:02.350" style="s2">apart each of the words in what you just</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.380" end="00:26:03.940" style="s2">said so latent left libertarian you kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.350" end="00:26:05.430" style="s2">of got into Layton but you can you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.940" end="00:26:08.230" style="s2">describe more of like what left</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.430" end="00:26:10.360" style="s2">libertarian means to you and how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.230" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">embodying that tradition near your own</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.360" end="00:26:14.980" style="s2">life yeah sure I mean frankly I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:16.450" style="s2">want any of this to get too bogged down</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.980" end="00:26:18.730" style="s2">and left and right I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.450" end="00:26:19.900" style="s2">super epiphenomena and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.730" end="00:26:21.940" style="s2">so much confusion around it right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.900" end="00:26:23.500" style="s2">that I would almost rather just do away</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.940" end="00:26:25.240" style="s2">with it but to answer your question I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.500" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">mean what I&#39;m essentially suggesting is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.240" end="00:26:30.190" style="s2">that this spirit I characterize for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:32.800" style="s2">this parisi astok spirit I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.190" end="00:26:35.380" style="s2">it has a kind of intrinsically left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.800" end="00:26:36.850" style="s2">flavored vibe to it because it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.380" end="00:26:38.530" style="s2">essentially a kind of insurrectionary</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.850" end="00:26:40.930" style="s2">attitude it&#39;s a kind of instruction or</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.530" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">ethos and it&#39;s militating against</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.930" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">injustice in a kind of provocative</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:47.410" style="s2">disruptive and radical way so I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">that that most clearly aligns with what</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.410" end="00:26:51.640" style="s2">we today think of as as a leftist kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:53.830" style="s2">of ethos and but but it&#39;s it&#39;s quite I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.640" end="00:26:56.530" style="s2">saying its latent meaning hidden or not</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.830" end="00:26:57.970" style="s2">yet cultivated it&#39;s not yet revealed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.530" end="00:27:00.520" style="s2">use a kind of hi to Gary and phrasing if</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.970" end="00:27:03.340" style="s2">you will it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s latent or hiding</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.520" end="00:27:05.320" style="s2">simply because of accidental contingent</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.340" end="00:27:07.690" style="s2">factors of up the public culture today</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.320" end="00:27:09.820" style="s2">and I think the only way you really kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.690" end="00:27:12.340" style="s2">of reveal it or unconcealed it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.820" end="00:27:14.530" style="s2">through this kind of what appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.340" end="00:27:16.840" style="s2">a kind of radically antisocial type of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.530" end="00:27:18.690" style="s2">of activity and I&#39;m trying to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.840" end="00:27:20.650" style="s2">show you all or make the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.690" end="00:27:23.110" style="s2">sometimes you might see certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.650" end="00:27:26.680" style="s2">performances that appear nasty or mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.110" end="00:27:29.530" style="s2">or or unreasonable or antisocial but in</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.680" end="00:27:30.520" style="s2">fact you might want to support that type</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.530" end="00:27:32.260" style="s2">of thing you might want to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.520" end="00:27:35.680" style="s2">more of that that might be exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.260" end="00:27:38.100" style="s2">we&#39;re lacking today Peter I see you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.680" end="00:27:40.660" style="s2">some questions would you like to ask yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.100" end="00:27:43.690" style="s2">first I did I love that talk man I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.660" end="00:27:45.250" style="s2">brilliant and I&#39;m really appreciative to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.690" end="00:27:46.780" style="s2">of you coming in like being really</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.250" end="00:27:48.070" style="s2">considered like talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.780" end="00:27:49.090" style="s2">well stoicism most people come into</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.070" end="00:27:51.490" style="s2">talking over their fuck they wanna talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.090" end="00:27:54.010" style="s2">about so I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.490" end="00:27:55.900" style="s2">so the question of this per easier thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.010" end="00:27:57.580" style="s2">and maybe we can put like a more norm</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.900" end="00:27:59.710" style="s2">Norma term to it like revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.580" end="00:28:02.560" style="s2">truthfulness if you will and then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.710" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2">used you mentioned reckless truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.560" end="00:28:05.920" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if there could be two</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.600" end="00:28:07.300" style="s2">versions of this revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.920" end="00:28:09.610" style="s2">truthfulness one that is a reckless</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.300" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">version and one that is reckful like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.610" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">wreck if that if I can use a tortured</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:15.370" style="s2">word like reckful truthfulness do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:17.110" style="s2">think that&#39;s a possibility it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.370" end="00:28:19.930" style="s2">definitely possible but my instinct is</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.110" end="00:28:23.320" style="s2">that the the conscious careful version</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.930" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">of pre Xia is precisely the government</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.320" end="00:28:27.220" style="s2">version it&#39;s the rulers version and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:28.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s essentially going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.220" end="00:28:30.370" style="s2">kind of conservative disposition and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.900" end="00:28:31.780" style="s2">perhaps you&#39;re right Peter but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.370" end="00:28:33.430" style="s2">there are times and places for both and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.780" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">maybe that is the most productive way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.430" end="00:28:37.150" style="s2">think about it but what I would argue is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:38.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s we have a lot of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.150" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">of conservative parisi a going on right</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.920" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">now because we have a lot of elites who</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">say one thing in private and they say</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:49.330" style="s2">another thing in public this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:51.160" style="s2">all over the place and I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.330" end="00:28:54.190" style="s2">that kind of conservative or careful pre</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.160" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">Xia it it doesn&#39;t have the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.190" end="00:28:59.750" style="s2">disruptive progressive fun</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:02.630" style="s2">it&#39;s often it often can be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.750" end="00:29:05.270" style="s2">selfishness with a kind of pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.630" end="00:29:06.620" style="s2">gloss right it&#39;s like I I I know what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.270" end="00:29:07.700" style="s2">really think but I don&#39;t want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.620" end="00:29:08.750" style="s2">about it in public because it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.700" end="00:29:10.820" style="s2">hurt people&#39;s feelings</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.750" end="00:29:12.710" style="s2">so it&#39;s framed as like I want to be good</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.820" end="00:29:14.600" style="s2">to society I want to be nice I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.710" end="00:29:16.429" style="s2">wanna be a bad person so I&#39;m gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.600" end="00:29:18.529" style="s2">what I really think in my head whereas</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.429" end="00:29:21.500" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s that&#39;s a very selfish</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.529" end="00:29:23.929" style="s2">kind of rationalization which is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.500" end="00:29:26.419" style="s2">really going on is that person wants to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.929" end="00:29:28.279" style="s2">maintain their own security and comfort</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.419" end="00:29:30.169" style="s2">and control with the truths that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.279" end="00:29:32.510" style="s2">know and they&#39;re not willing to take the</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.510" end="00:29:37.370" style="s2">the social opprobrium of really putting</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.179" end="00:29:40.520" style="s2">it out there in public so here let me</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.370" end="00:29:41.899" style="s2">see if I can yes and that so one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.520" end="00:29:43.700" style="s2">really like this idea like this slick</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.899" end="00:29:45.260" style="s2">sort of like the noble lie of keeping</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.700" end="00:29:48.770" style="s2">these white lies right that helps the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.260" end="00:29:49.850" style="s2">social cohesion yes um and it&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.770" end="00:29:51.350" style="s2">case in point I&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.850" end="00:29:53.179" style="s2">this lately is especially in the work</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.350" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">world it&#39;s like how you doing today I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.179" end="00:29:55.640" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:57.740" style="s2">like what the fuck does that mean right</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.640" end="00:29:59.029" style="s2">no no one&#39;s good like I&#39;m like I&#39;m on a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.740" end="00:30:01.159" style="s2">roller coaster of emotions these days</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.029" end="00:30:02.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m just one of them&#39;s not good but</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.159" end="00:30:04.580" style="s2">it&#39;s just the word to just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.510" end="00:30:05.779" style="s2">the nice and easy so you in streak and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.580" end="00:30:08.029" style="s2">instrumentalize the person forever the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.779" end="00:30:09.320" style="s2">fucking one instrumentalize and for so</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.029" end="00:30:10.309" style="s2">it&#39;s just like one example why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.320" end="00:30:13.730" style="s2">telling each other these these like</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.309" end="00:30:16.010" style="s2">white lies but so I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.730" end="00:30:17.210" style="s2">notice that I was a trainer right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.010" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">still a trainer and the Dale Carnegie</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.210" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">Training the Highland friends and if</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:21.710" style="s2">most people been around 400 years so</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:23.029" style="s2">with all those social fluency and shit</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.710" end="00:30:25.909" style="s2">like that and there&#39;s something called</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.029" end="00:30:27.140" style="s2">meta communication where you not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.909" end="00:30:28.580" style="s2">talking about the content where you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.140" end="00:30:30.919" style="s2">jump outside of the content and talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.580" end="00:30:31.940" style="s2">about maybe the asymmetrical intentions</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.919" end="00:30:34.039" style="s2">that are involved in that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.940" end="00:30:35.690" style="s2">and then you can call it out in such a</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.039" end="00:30:37.580" style="s2">way that it&#39;s tactful and you allow the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.690" end="00:30:39.799" style="s2">other person to say face they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.580" end="00:30:41.240" style="s2">triggered and then you can put dumb and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.799" end="00:30:42.919" style="s2">yourself at the edge of your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.240" end="00:30:44.450" style="s2">together but you have to have that kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.919" end="00:30:46.490" style="s2">of social attack in order to do so and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.450" end="00:30:48.049" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I guess when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.490" end="00:30:51.289" style="s2">gesturing towards for a potential of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.049" end="00:30:53.570" style="s2">reckful truthfulness okay I like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.289" end="00:30:57.590" style="s2">yeah I didn&#39;t know Dale Carnegie was so</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.570" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">based but that works I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.590" end="00:31:00.890" style="s2">this is an interesting avenue for</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.649" style="s2">research and for experimentation kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.890" end="00:31:04.790" style="s2">figuring out micro tactics where people</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.649" end="00:31:07.210" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.790" end="00:31:10.430" style="s2">kind of explore this frontier of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.210" end="00:31:12.530" style="s2">reckless truth-telling but in in clever</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.430" end="00:31:15.020" style="s2">ways that perhaps don&#39;t need to be as as</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.530" end="00:31:16.820" style="s2">explosive and as and as crazy as as</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.020" end="00:31:19.610" style="s2">someone like Diogenes there could</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.820" end="00:31:22.070" style="s2">totally be a whole menu of tactics and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.610" end="00:31:25.510" style="s2">strategies for introducing this type of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.070" end="00:31:28.430" style="s2">a style to your life and this type of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.510" end="00:31:30.290" style="s2">adventure without being as crazy as</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.430" end="00:31:33.320" style="s2">Diogenes and perhaps you just cited one</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.290" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">example yeah and the seduction comes to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.320" end="00:31:37.310" style="s2">mind but maybe it&#39;s a conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:42.050" style="s2">can bookmark for another time so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.310" end="00:31:44.810" style="s2">take Raven back in for the Q&amp;A cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.050" end="00:31:46.520" style="s2">just I&#39;m kind of wondering like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.810" end="00:31:49.310" style="s2">seems to be some sort of dispositional</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.520" end="00:31:51.350" style="s2">like thing going on here as well like</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.310" end="00:31:53.180" style="s2">especially these characters in history</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.350" end="00:31:56.390" style="s2">where they had to incur such a high cost</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.180" end="00:31:59.150" style="s2">for for taking these radical positions I</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.390" end="00:32:02.660" style="s2">mean especially Socrates right so and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.150" end="00:32:03.800" style="s2">and I think like especially on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.660" end="00:32:06.410" style="s2">Internet there are people who are just</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.800" end="00:32:08.210" style="s2">kind of antagonistic who just find each</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.410" end="00:32:11.060" style="s2">other and are just being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.210" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">outrageous I think Ron mentioned this in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.060" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">like a immature kind of disagreeableness</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:18.020" style="s2">versus like a mature kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:21.080" style="s2">disagreeableness do you have anything to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.020" end="00:32:22.790" style="s2">say in terms of like being sure that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.080" end="00:32:24.890" style="s2">you&#39;re being truthful because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.790" end="00:32:27.620" style="s2">many levels of delusion possible like</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.890" end="00:32:29.960" style="s2">you may go after some sort of idea or</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.620" end="00:32:32.930" style="s2">some sort of consensus without even</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.960" end="00:32:36.530" style="s2">examining yourself in terms of whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.930" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">or not you&#39;re really being honest yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.530" end="00:32:39.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a really really good question and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:42.110" style="s2">think you&#39;re absolutely right that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.350" end="00:32:45.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of cultural activity going</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.110" end="00:32:47.530" style="s2">on right now which might even fancy</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.350" end="00:32:50.210" style="s2">itself as having this kind of chemical</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.530" end="00:32:53.180" style="s2">kind of quality to it but in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.210" end="00:32:54.650" style="s2">just seething bad faith and resentment</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.180" end="00:32:57.020" style="s2">playing itself out and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.650" end="00:33:01.700" style="s2">destructive circles and yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.020" end="00:33:04.910" style="s2">there is a very very difficult line to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">walk on in the Christian tradition this</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.910" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">is you know why they call it the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:10.220" style="s2">straight and narrow path it&#39;s hard right</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:12.650" style="s2">you there pitfalls on both sides in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.220" end="00:33:14.360" style="s2">delusion register it&#39;s it&#39;s like how he</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.650" end="00:33:16.570" style="s2">talks about de territorial ization and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.360" end="00:33:18.549" style="s2">and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.570" end="00:33:21.370" style="s2">I he&#39;s at pains to point out that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.549" end="00:33:23.710" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of pitfalls on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.370" end="00:33:26.950" style="s2">it&#39;s this really difficult delicate</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.710" end="00:33:28.690" style="s2">balance that you have to walk and so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.950" end="00:33:30.610" style="s2">completely agree I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.690" end="00:33:33.309" style="s2">huge question a huge problem I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.610" end="00:33:35.289" style="s2">sure that I have an amazingly impressive</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.309" end="00:33:37.059" style="s2">solution to the puzzle but I can say I</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.289" end="00:33:39.309" style="s2">can say one or two things one is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.059" end="00:33:40.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a really really amazing book</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.309" end="00:33:42.220" style="s2">probably I think one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.630" end="00:33:45.429" style="s2">philosophy books I&#39;ve ever read in my</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.220" end="00:33:48.460" style="s2">life by Peter slaughter Dyke I called</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.429" end="00:33:49.750" style="s2">the critique of cynical reason and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.460" end="00:33:51.100" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested in the stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.750" end="00:33:53.230" style="s2">talking about with cynicism and kinases</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.100" end="00:33:56.049" style="s2">omits pretty much the best place to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.230" end="00:33:58.419" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a massive book</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.049" end="00:34:00.220" style="s2">it&#39;s an extraordinarily interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.419" end="00:34:02.740" style="s2">complicated kind of theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.220" end="00:34:06.669" style="s2">historical tale that he tells about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.740" end="00:34:07.750" style="s2">evolution of cynicism and it&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.669" end="00:34:09.429" style="s2">learned most of what I know about</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.750" end="00:34:11.079" style="s2">cynicism so most of what I told you</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.429" end="00:34:13.690" style="s2">today about cynicism kind of came from</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.079" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">that book and I think one would need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.690" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">reread that book I think that book has</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:20.369" style="s2">answers to this question but but in</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:23.139" style="s2">short it&#39;s something to the effect that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.369" end="00:34:26.260" style="s2">kennis ism has kinases amande modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.139" end="00:34:28.179" style="s2">cynicism had this weirdly kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.260" end="00:34:31.510" style="s2">volatile character where it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.179" end="00:34:33.339" style="s2">for Kinnison to flip into cynicism and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.510" end="00:34:36.819" style="s2">think something like that is going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.339" end="00:34:39.780" style="s2">with the kind of resentful bitter</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.819" end="00:34:40.929" style="s2">destructive kind of trolling</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.780" end="00:34:43.750" style="s2">truth-telling</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.929" end="00:34:45.879" style="s2">that you see on the Internet today to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.750" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">a little bit more specific just to try</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.879" end="00:34:50.260" style="s2">to give you something of concrete value</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:52.300" style="s2">and not just a hand wave like I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.260" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">M up until now I would say one</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.300" end="00:34:56.490" style="s2">characteristic that that is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:59.619" style="s2">reliable differentiator between</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.490" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">resentful trolling cynicism and</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:09.220" style="s2">be paying a price under your own name so</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.690" end="00:35:10.630" style="s2">if you look at what some of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.220" end="00:35:12.460" style="s2">behavior online right now it&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.630" end="00:35:13.930" style="s2">anonymous people it&#39;s by trolls right</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.460" end="00:35:15.790" style="s2">and there&#39;s this big debate in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.930" end="00:35:17.740" style="s2">of radical intellectual circles of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.790" end="00:35:19.240" style="s2">should you go should you write on the</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.190" end="00:35:30.550" style="s2">so long as you are writing under your</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.550" end="00:35:34.660" style="s2">under your own name and you are paying</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:37.360" style="s2">the price for what you say and what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.660" end="00:35:39.130" style="s2">do it&#39;s much more likely to be the real</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.360" end="00:35:42.310" style="s2">kind of criticism that we want more of</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.130" end="00:35:44.440" style="s2">whereas if you&#39;re insulated and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.740" end="00:35:55.690" style="s2">that pseudonymity is actually preventing</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.010" end="00:35:57.310" style="s2">the parisi</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.690" end="00:35:59.020" style="s2">from having its effects on the social</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.310" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">fabric and it&#39;s actually locking it up</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.020" end="00:36:02.050" style="s2">into this little box that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:04.390" style="s2">self-contained and then that that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.050" end="00:36:05.950" style="s2">that kind of antagonistic energies just</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.390" end="00:36:07.720" style="s2">circulates within its own little system</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.950" end="00:36:11.910" style="s2">and it never really touches the social</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.720" end="00:36:11.910" style="s2">fabric and that would be my hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.330" end="00:36:16.210" style="s2">because you need you need to have skin</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.830" end="00:36:17.290" style="s2">in the game that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.210" end="00:36:19.030" style="s2">you need skin in the game and you also</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.290" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">need feedback loops you know to make</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.030" end="00:36:22.660" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re on track and I just</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:24.040" style="s2">have an avatar that&#39;s doing all of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.660" end="00:36:25.840" style="s2">work for you you don&#39;t have that real</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.040" end="00:36:27.910" style="s2">interfacing with the real and incurring</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.840" end="00:36:29.710" style="s2">the actual social cost of being truthful</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.910" end="00:36:31.300" style="s2">and I think maybe the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.710" end="00:36:32.430" style="s2">question is that like honestly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.300" end="00:36:34.060" style="s2">something you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.430" end="00:36:36.190" style="s2">responsibility for there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.060" end="00:36:37.960" style="s2">prescription for how to do this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.190" end="00:36:39.820" style="s2">like you have to do your own radical</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.960" end="00:36:41.080" style="s2">truth-telling where you&#39;re incurring a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.820" end="00:36:46.180" style="s2">kind of cost and see where that takes</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.080" end="00:36:48.460" style="s2">you and yeah great those are very</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.180" end="00:36:50.260" style="s2">precise OnPoint additions to what I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.460" end="00:36:50.590" style="s2">saying absolutely correct I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.260" end="00:36:55.090" style="s2">all that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.590" end="00:36:59.320" style="s2">yeah mimetic paper question would you</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.090" end="00:37:01.360" style="s2">like to I guess this is sort of almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.320" end="00:37:04.600" style="s2">what was just asked but what happens</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.360" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">when chemical parousia goes mimetic I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.600" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">couldn&#39;t the countercultural and some</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:11.500" style="s2">cultural movements of the 60s and 70s be</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:15.010" style="s2">viewed this way and also isn&#39;t that what</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.500" end="00:37:18.070" style="s2">culture war II is like that&#39;s maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.010" end="00:37:19.630" style="s2">way of viewing culture war yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.070" end="00:37:22.300" style="s2">I mean I think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.630" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">consciousness a self-consciousness from</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.300" end="00:37:26.830" style="s2">the very beginning that Priya has a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:29.050" style="s2">memetic quality the whole point of doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.830" end="00:37:31.930" style="s2">these kind of ridiculous performative</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.050" end="00:37:34.840" style="s2">truth-telling actions that someone like</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.930" end="00:37:36.550" style="s2">Diogenes did was because he knew that it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.840" end="00:37:38.620" style="s2">would percolate beyond him rumors would</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.550" end="00:37:40.510" style="s2">spread right images and stories and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.620" end="00:37:42.460" style="s2">anecdotes would spread well beyond him I</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.510" end="00:37:44.020" style="s2">think he knew I didn&#39;t he knew that very</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.460" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">well and that&#39;s something I mentioned at</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.020" end="00:37:46.510" style="s2">the beginning of my</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:48.040" style="s2">talk was that Diogenes had a very nice</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.510" end="00:37:49.780" style="s2">little phrase for what he was doing he</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.040" end="00:37:51.870" style="s2">called it defacing the currency and</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.780" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a really fascinating and rich</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.870" end="00:37:56.470" style="s2">label I think for this type of activity</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:38:00.130" style="s2">because what is currency on some level</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.470" end="00:38:02.080" style="s2">currency is mimetic right it&#39;s on when</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.130" end="00:38:05.100" style="s2">when you I think what he was basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.080" end="00:38:07.750" style="s2">trying to say was that any social order</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.100" end="00:38:09.790" style="s2">basically has a set of values right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.750" end="00:38:12.430" style="s2">and those and those values are</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.790" end="00:38:15.100" style="s2">determined in part by all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.430" end="00:38:16.540" style="s2">social nonsense right whose valuable</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.100" end="00:38:19.660" style="s2">who&#39;s popular who&#39;s liked who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.540" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">there is a kind of hierarchy of social</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.660" end="00:38:23.290" style="s2">value which is not at all founded in</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:23.950" style="s2">truth and it&#39;s biased in many different</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.290" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">ways right</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.950" end="00:38:29.620" style="s2">and currency like the capitalist economy</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:31.870" style="s2">money as we know it is is part and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.620" end="00:38:35.500" style="s2">parcel of this kind of arbitrary fake</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.870" end="00:38:38.350" style="s2">kind of value system right and but he</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.500" end="00:38:40.360" style="s2">seem to believe that if one acts out the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.350" end="00:38:42.730" style="s2">truth in this kind of profound way that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.360" end="00:38:44.590" style="s2">causes a that brings a cost on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.730" end="00:38:47.260" style="s2">performer or the speaker that in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.590" end="00:38:49.630" style="s2">weird way it has this any luck table</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.260" end="00:38:51.400" style="s2">quality of decreasing the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.630" end="00:38:54.060" style="s2">fake currency in other words defacing</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.400" end="00:38:57.370" style="s2">the currency as we know it but of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.060" end="00:38:58.540" style="s2">introducing a new type of value you</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.370" end="00:39:00.190" style="s2">might even cite Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.540" end="00:39:01.570" style="s2">transvaluation of values you might even</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.190" end="00:39:04.300" style="s2">put Nietzsche in this tradition I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.570" end="00:39:06.190" style="s2">that would be quite reasonable and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.300" end="00:39:07.720" style="s2">and I think the essence of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.190" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">mechanism like why does that work how</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.720" end="00:39:12.820" style="s2">does that work is essentially what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:16.950" style="s2">now call mimetics so that would be my my</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.820" end="00:39:16.950" style="s2">best shot at an answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.770" end="00:39:25.690" style="s2">excellent Tyson would you like to and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.050" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">meet yourself and share your story sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.690" end="00:39:31.780" style="s2">thank you yeah so my story is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:33.099" style="s2">morning actually recorded a video sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.780" end="00:39:35.530" style="s2">of directed towards some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.099" end="00:39:37.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking and feeling about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.530" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">you can say like the mimetic tribe of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.750" end="00:39:42.550" style="s2">the Great Awakening it&#39;s like queuing</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:47.470" style="s2">honors anti Bill Gates I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.550" end="00:39:49.470" style="s2">like people of this mindset in my my</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.470" end="00:39:51.849" style="s2">circle my past friendships and all this</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.470" end="00:39:53.560" style="s2">so my video was directed toward them and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.849" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">it was things I knew would be triggering</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.560" end="00:39:57.910" style="s2">to people people leave that I even know</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:59.320" style="s2">personally and like respect and love as</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.910" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">people might think I&#39;m talking directly</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.320" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">to them and get upset and so I recorded</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:05.589" style="s2">this and it helped me get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.390" style="s2">clarity in my thinking and that felt</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.589" end="00:40:09.580" style="s2">good to really have the process of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.390" end="00:40:11.020" style="s2">thinking for myself and express some of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.580" end="00:40:14.830" style="s2">my thoughts and then I chose not to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.020" end="00:40:16.510" style="s2">share the video simply because I knew a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.830" end="00:40:18.940" style="s2">lot of my motivation for then posting it</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.510" end="00:40:21.490" style="s2">was like this excitement of the drama</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.940" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">that it might stir up and then also the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.490" end="00:40:24.730" style="s2">people that would like affirm me and be</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:28.119" style="s2">like yeah like we&#39;re on your side we</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.730" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">like this and so I think what this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.119" end="00:40:31.920" style="s2">helping me do is like just I want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">refine sort of my internal compass of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.920" end="00:40:37.020" style="s2">what to share when to kind of rein it</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:39.820" style="s2">back and just keep it to my own process</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.020" end="00:40:41.140" style="s2">and then also connecting this with we</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.820" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">had Brad Blanton on yesterday talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.140" end="00:40:47.320" style="s2">about radical honesty um so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:49.510" style="s2">just curious a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.320" end="00:40:51.099" style="s2">like your internal compass for you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.510" end="00:40:53.140" style="s2">when is it when you feel that call where</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.099" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">there&#39;s like a responsibility to to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.140" end="00:40:57.400" style="s2">share and to express that truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:58.839" style="s2">or when do you find yourself like sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.400" end="00:41:01.630" style="s2">of reining it back in keeping it to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.839" end="00:41:04.450" style="s2">yourself mmm it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.630" end="00:41:06.609" style="s2">really great question I mean I I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.450" end="00:41:09.070" style="s2">never pretend to be able to give advice</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.609" end="00:41:12.609" style="s2">on this sort of thing so this is a type</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.070" end="00:41:14.020" style="s2">of question every person irreducibly has</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.609" end="00:41:15.599" style="s2">to answer for themselves so with that as</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.020" end="00:41:17.349" style="s2">an important caveat I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.599" end="00:41:19.089" style="s2">certainly a bit about my thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.349" end="00:41:20.770" style="s2">processes and how I think about that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.089" end="00:41:22.270" style="s2">I would never want to give this as</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.770" end="00:41:24.250" style="s2">advice because these are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.270" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">existential puzzles you know these are</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.250" end="00:41:27.970" style="s2">essentially decisions that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:29.589" style="s2">have to make in the in the dark without</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.970" end="00:41:31.450" style="s2">without any kind of guardrail and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.589" end="00:41:32.920" style="s2">different people&#39;s situations are going</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.450" end="00:41:34.080" style="s2">to be very different but what I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.920" end="00:41:35.250" style="s2">say is one</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.080" end="00:41:37.860" style="s2">I thought about listening to your story</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.250" end="00:41:39.960" style="s2">is that I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.860" end="00:41:41.400" style="s2">very healthy instinct to think you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.960" end="00:41:43.080" style="s2">after you make a video or after you</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.400" end="00:41:44.340" style="s2">write something to think you know am i</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.080" end="00:41:45.660" style="s2">doing this for the right reasons and if</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.340" end="00:41:47.790" style="s2">and if you fear that maybe you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.660" end="00:41:49.140" style="s2">it for the wrong reasons to hold fire</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.790" end="00:41:51.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s certainly an</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.140" end="00:41:53.250" style="s2">honorable thought process but on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.750" end="00:41:55.830" style="s2">other hand I sometimes think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.250" end="00:41:57.900" style="s2">everything I&#39;m talking about as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.830" end="00:42:00.330" style="s2">kind of channeling some of the base</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.900" end="00:42:02.250" style="s2">desires that we have not based but base</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.330" end="00:42:05.130" style="s2">you know the lower appetites and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.250" end="00:42:06.360" style="s2">lower desires that we have I I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.130" end="00:42:08.040" style="s2">the the kind of philosophy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.360" end="00:42:10.530" style="s2">developing here is is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.040" end="00:42:14.150" style="s2">channeling our base animalistic desires</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.530" end="00:42:16.890" style="s2">or appetites in a way that is productive</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.150" end="00:42:18.120" style="s2">so for instance I mean when I sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.890" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">when I make videos when I write blog</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.120" end="00:42:22.890" style="s2">posts or when I tweet stuff or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:26.040" style="s2">I definitely can feel a kind of lust for</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.890" end="00:42:28.110" style="s2">the drama a lust for the reaction I find</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.040" end="00:42:30.870" style="s2">it fun of course and and I want that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.110" end="00:42:34.440" style="s2">I would be lying if I said that wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.870" end="00:42:36.360" style="s2">motivator for me but my my answer to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.440" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">that is that we are essentially animals</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.360" end="00:42:41.340" style="s2">and we do have base based desires and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:42.840" style="s2">base appetites and I think part of life</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.340" end="00:42:45.540" style="s2">is the kind of spiritual practice of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.840" end="00:42:48.150" style="s2">reigning those in of course and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.540" end="00:42:50.700" style="s2">controlling them and and and not being a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.150" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">victim of your of your appetites or base</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.700" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">desires but they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:56.700" style="s2">ultimately go away and if you have this</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:58.410" style="s2">kind of perverse drive to literally</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.700" end="00:43:00.360" style="s2">stamp them out you&#39;re just going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.410" end="00:43:02.970" style="s2">um one of those like terrible morbid</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.360" end="00:43:04.860" style="s2">Christians who you know that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.970" end="00:43:06.510" style="s2">a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a bad path that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.860" end="00:43:08.850" style="s2">that&#39;s the incorrect in many ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.510" end="00:43:10.590" style="s2">even a sin it&#39;s like scrupulousness so</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.850" end="00:43:11.970" style="s2">there are ways of being like too morbid</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.590" end="00:43:14.850" style="s2">and to Christians such that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.970" end="00:43:16.860" style="s2">actually a sin in its own right and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.850" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">so I think that there is actually a way</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.860" end="00:43:20.190" style="s2">of just kind of owning up to your base</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:21.510" style="s2">desires and of course we want a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.190" end="00:43:23.370" style="s2">drama of course we want a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.510" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">excitement we want adventure we want a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.370" end="00:43:27.240" style="s2">little bit of recognition as human</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:30.660" style="s2">beings as thinkers as as whatever and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.240" end="00:43:32.310" style="s2">think if you&#39;re okay so that I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.660" end="00:43:34.260" style="s2">wrap that up by saying the key ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.310" end="00:43:37.230" style="s2">criteria that I always go back to is</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.260" end="00:43:39.390" style="s2">really just one thing everything begins</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.230" end="00:43:40.860" style="s2">and ends with this one thing is do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.390" end="00:43:44.340" style="s2">really believe what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.860" end="00:43:46.340" style="s2">true if you do you really can&#39;t go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.340" end="00:43:48.200" style="s2">putting it out there</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.340" end="00:43:49.730" style="s2">you can you can cause all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.200" end="00:43:51.410" style="s2">damage to your life and inconvenience</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.730" end="00:43:53.210" style="s2">and and difficulties for yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.410" end="00:43:54.410" style="s2">your family and friends for sure but</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.210" end="00:43:56.270" style="s2">when it comes down to is it the right</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.410" end="00:43:57.710" style="s2">thing to do ultimately if you really</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.270" end="00:43:59.210" style="s2">believe what you&#39;re saying is true or</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.710" end="00:44:01.940" style="s2">what you&#39;re writing or speaking is true</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.210" end="00:44:03.290" style="s2">it&#39;s never ever ever wrong to put it out</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.940" end="00:44:07.000" style="s2">in public that&#39;s what I believe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.290" end="00:44:07.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s what I always default him</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.109" end="00:44:16.670" style="s2">thank you very much yeah definitely I</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.420" end="00:44:20.420" style="s2">would say to that and I&#39;ll just say this</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.670" end="00:44:22.549" style="s2">it I guess is that like the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.420" end="00:44:24.019" style="s2">that you you have to take a risk right</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.549" end="00:44:25.309" style="s2">but you&#39;re also incurring a cost by</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.019" end="00:44:26.989" style="s2">creating drama like what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.309" end="00:44:28.759" style="s2">Justin when you have your face on it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.989" end="00:44:30.499" style="s2">it&#39;s your friends and that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.759" end="00:44:31.609" style="s2">stirring up all of this with it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.499" end="00:44:32.719" style="s2">just attention that you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.609" end="00:44:34.910" style="s2">you&#39;re getting a lot of inconvenience</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.719" end="00:44:36.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s like the feedback loop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.910" end="00:44:38.749" style="s2">the loop like you change the environment</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.380" end="00:44:41.959" style="s2">that you&#39;re in you get new feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.749" end="00:44:43.160" style="s2">you actually have to manage the drama</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.959" end="00:44:45.289" style="s2">you have to figure out how to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.160" end="00:44:47.299" style="s2">it and that in a way is actually like</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.289" end="00:44:50.420" style="s2">teaching you whether or not you were</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.299" end="00:44:51.890" style="s2">right did you actually truly believe</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.420" end="00:44:53.539" style="s2">this thing because if you do you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.890" end="00:44:55.489" style="s2">willing to fight for it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.539" end="00:44:57.319" style="s2">willing to put the work in but if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.489" end="00:44:59.390" style="s2">are like shit I really wish I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.319" end="00:45:01.009" style="s2">have done that I don&#39;t feel like dealing</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.390" end="00:45:03.859" style="s2">with all of this that&#39;s a sign that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.009" end="00:45:05.900" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a misalignment and a kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.859" end="00:45:07.430" style="s2">of delusion but there&#39;s a theme that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.900" end="00:45:09.380" style="s2">coming up in the Stowe about thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.430" end="00:45:10.729" style="s2">public and I think that this this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.380" end="00:45:15.349" style="s2">part of what you&#39;re talking about Justin</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.729" end="00:45:16.579" style="s2">as well had one quick practical thing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.349" end="00:45:18.739" style="s2">the to the question I was just asked</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.579" end="00:45:20.930" style="s2">very briefly on unless you have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.739" end="00:45:22.729" style="s2">audience by the way none of your friends</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.930" end="00:45:24.229" style="s2">or family are ever gonna care about what</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.729" end="00:45:27.589" style="s2">you say or be offended by I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.229" end="00:45:28.699" style="s2">add that like I I mean I have a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.589" end="00:45:31.039" style="s2">have a huge audience at all but I have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.699" end="00:45:33.049" style="s2">decent audience and I&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.039" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">pretty wild stuff for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.049" end="00:45:37.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve never once had an actual friend or</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:40.759" style="s2">family member ever come to me with</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.430" end="00:45:43.190" style="s2">anything that I made or said and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.759" end="00:45:43.940" style="s2">upset or or anything like that there</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.190" end="00:45:45.349" style="s2">have been a couple times where like</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.940" end="00:45:47.299" style="s2">something I said blew up and went viral</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.349" end="00:45:49.190" style="s2">and people in my life have heard about</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.299" end="00:45:52.759" style="s2">that and then maybe ask me about that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.190" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">but short of that and that&#39;s very rare</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.759" end="00:45:56.420" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:57.829" style="s2">some blog post or some video actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.420" end="00:45:59.390" style="s2">making its way to any of your friends</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.829" end="00:46:01.130" style="s2">and family in fact if anything the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.390" end="00:46:02.390" style="s2">problem you&#39;ll experience will be why</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.130" end="00:46:03.890" style="s2">are none of my friends or family ever</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.390" end="00:46:08.930" style="s2">even hearing about this or caring about</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.890" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">this question and I&#39;m not exactly sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.930" end="00:46:12.859" style="s2">how to approach it but it does kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:15.739" style="s2">get back to this dispositional thing so</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.859" end="00:46:17.420" style="s2">you know there it tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.739" end="00:46:17.900" style="s2">dispositional differences in men and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.420" end="00:46:21.560" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.900" end="00:46:23.660" style="s2">and women tend to not be as oriented</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.560" end="00:46:26.360" style="s2">around risk-taking and I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.660" end="00:46:27.860" style="s2">wondering about what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.360" end="00:46:29.690" style="s2">bringing women into this I know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.860" end="00:46:31.700" style="s2">there are some figures out there like</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.690" end="00:46:35.630" style="s2">like Ayla is a great example of a woman</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.700" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">who just like speaks the truth but how</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.630" end="00:46:40.550" style="s2">do we get women to take on this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:42.440" style="s2">like speaking truth to power and just</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.550" end="00:46:44.090" style="s2">exposing themselves when there is risk</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.440" end="00:46:46.070" style="s2">involved and there may be a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.090" end="00:46:47.120" style="s2">be more risk-averse in general it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.070" end="00:46:48.830" style="s2">good question it&#39;s a very good question</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.120" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">probably a better question for a woman</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.830" end="00:46:53.770" style="s2">to answer but my instinct is I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">any particular need for any type of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.770" end="00:46:57.800" style="s2">positive project or intervention to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">increase the proportion of women doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.800" end="00:47:01.580" style="s2">this sort of thing I am if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:03.260" style="s2">something you&#39;re interested in then I</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.580" end="00:47:04.940" style="s2">support you and you should try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.260" end="00:47:08.390" style="s2">that out but I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.940" end="00:47:11.000" style="s2">reason why any kind of gender inequality</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.390" end="00:47:13.580" style="s2">on on who&#39;s doing this I don&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.000" end="00:47:16.610" style="s2">necessarily being a problem yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.580" end="00:47:18.860" style="s2">probably does select for this type of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.610" end="00:47:21.350" style="s2">activity probably does select for for</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.860" end="00:47:24.980" style="s2">men but as you said there will be women</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.350" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">who who do it too for sure so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.980" end="00:47:27.650" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t really I don&#39;t really see</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:31.480" style="s2">why you would need to correct that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.650" end="00:47:33.710" style="s2">imbalance personally but I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.480" end="00:47:35.210" style="s2">probably if you wanted to do that if</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.710" end="00:47:36.610" style="s2">that&#39;s something you&#39;re interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.210" end="00:47:40.820" style="s2">would probably just be a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.610" end="00:47:43.730" style="s2">developing this philosophy and a a kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.820" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">of language that is more a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.730" end="00:47:47.180" style="s2">that women are interested in right so</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:48.560" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there are feminine I&#39;m sure you</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.180" end="00:47:50.390" style="s2">could tell the historical narrative I</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.560" end="00:47:54.200" style="s2">told through women right I mean I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.390" end="00:47:55.580" style="s2">they exist but as I said the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.200" end="00:47:57.350" style="s2">or the lineage I tried to paint for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.580" end="00:47:59.960" style="s2">today is sort of subterranean enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.350" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">finding the the female equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.960" end="00:48:04.010" style="s2">this tradition which I&#39;m sure exists on</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:05.480" style="s2">some level it&#39;s probably even more</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.010" end="00:48:08.300" style="s2">subterranean but it might be a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.480" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">research agenda and by illustrating that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.300" end="00:48:12.590" style="s2">and showing how it works that could very</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:18.710" style="s2">well bring more women into the fold of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.590" end="00:48:20.750" style="s2">this type of experimentation perhaps for</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.710" end="00:48:23.570" style="s2">sure well okay we have one more question</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.750" end="00:48:26.360" style="s2">here and I&#39;m gonna read it out loud for</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.570" end="00:48:27.950" style="s2">this for Brent okay so this is what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.360" end="00:48:29.360" style="s2">saying in the comments I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.950" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">everything you Justin are saying in</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.360" end="00:48:34.250" style="s2">theory in fact I offered to Peter to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:36.050" style="s2">stoah on cynicism Kinnison before I knew</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.250" end="00:48:38.900" style="s2">you were doing one but I see you as</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.050" end="00:48:41.660" style="s2">somewhat of a left reactionary and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.900" end="00:48:43.880" style="s2">even identify as libertarian but I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.660" end="00:48:46.580" style="s2">you are no Socrates and have limited</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.880" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">social solidarity and concern so my</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.580" end="00:48:51.650" style="s2">question is why are you averse to mass</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:54.340" style="s2">politics particularly the Bernie Sanders</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.650" end="00:48:58.820" style="s2">movement which at its core is about</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.340" end="00:49:00.380" style="s2">parasya so there&#39;s a lot there I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.820" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">start with kind of just the end bits</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.380" end="00:49:04.490" style="s2">which is that I&#39;m not against mass</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:07.720" style="s2">politics I just believe that mass</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.490" end="00:49:10.910" style="s2">politics is essentially at odds with</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.720" end="00:49:12.800" style="s2">true philosophy or truth-telling or even</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.910" end="00:49:15.920" style="s2">true science any type of truth seeking</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:17.210" style="s2">and mass politics are are at odds if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.920" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">are going to play a game of mass</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.210" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">politics you are going to be lying in</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:24.859" style="s2">one way or another now it&#39;s with maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:26.270" style="s2">just the the indirect exception of kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.859" end="00:49:27.380" style="s2">of reframing this kind of chemical</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.270" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">politics I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.380" end="00:49:30.650" style="s2">you can reframe it as a kind of mass</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.740" style="s2">action right because I am ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.650" end="00:49:35.960" style="s2">interested in how can truth-telling</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.740" end="00:49:38.060" style="s2">individuals create desirable ripples in</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.960" end="00:49:39.590" style="s2">the social fabric so in that ways in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.060" end="00:49:41.030" style="s2">that way I am still interested in mass</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.590" end="00:49:42.859" style="s2">politics I am still interested in</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.030" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">essentially revolutionary politics so</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.859" end="00:49:45.380" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in overthrowing</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">institutions I really am I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.380" end="00:49:49.730" style="s2">in overthrowing this rotten false order</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:52.040" style="s2">that that defines our our life today</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.730" end="00:49:53.720" style="s2">it&#39;s been one of my abiding interests</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.040" end="00:49:55.700" style="s2">and passions ever since I came of age</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.720" end="00:49:58.220" style="s2">it&#39;s figuring out how to overthrow all</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.700" end="00:49:59.990" style="s2">of this all of this that&#39;s so rotten so</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.220" end="00:50:02.270" style="s2">in that sense I remain highly invested</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.990" end="00:50:03.859" style="s2">and highly interested in a kind of mass</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.270" end="00:50:05.480" style="s2">politics but what most people mean by</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.859" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">mass politics like organizing other</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.480" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">people to try to change something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:11.540" style="s2">just at its core it&#39;s going to require a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:13.190" style="s2">certain amount of lying as I try to kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.540" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">of sketch earlier and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.190" end="00:50:17.330" style="s2">that&#39;s necessarily bad I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:18.710" style="s2">part of life for sure but if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.330" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;re pursuing a kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.710" end="00:50:24.170" style="s2">vocation then you can&#39;t engage in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.369" style="s2">kind of mass politics is my short answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.170" end="00:50:26.690" style="s2">to that kind of long question I I know</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.369" end="00:50:27.830" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of ignoring some parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.690" end="00:50:30.530" style="s2">question but I just kind of chose to</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.830" end="00:50:34.550" style="s2">respond to what I most immediately had</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.530" end="00:50:36.280" style="s2">something to say about thank you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.550" end="00:50:44.600" style="s2">curious if brent has a follow-up to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.280" end="00:50:46.550" style="s2">22 okay do we think we can get this last</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.600" end="00:50:48.830" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.550" end="00:50:50.600" style="s2">Justin if it runs over a little bit at</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.830" end="00:50:54.410" style="s2">the hour you okay I&#39;m fine no problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.600" end="00:50:58.870" style="s2">okay great so Michael would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.410" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">admit yourself massive question sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.870" end="00:51:08.660" style="s2">maybe I can give you guys a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:11.870" style="s2">background one sec I try to video yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.660" end="00:51:13.700" style="s2">so I&#39;m actually teaching a course at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.870" end="00:51:15.860" style="s2">birthing Montreal in innovation</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.700" end="00:51:21.350" style="s2">management and I&#39;m in front of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.860" end="00:51:24.440" style="s2">challenge of trying to tell through a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.350" end="00:51:26.330" style="s2">bunch of people you know that their</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.440" end="00:51:29.030" style="s2">future is compromised you know like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.330" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">always know like I think that dilemma of</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.030" end="00:51:36.350" style="s2">how can I get a message true how can i</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:39.260" style="s2">how can it you know how I can deliver</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.350" end="00:51:43.310" style="s2">something in such a way that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.260" end="00:51:45.290" style="s2">audience will get it digest it and do</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.310" end="00:51:48.590" style="s2">something about it and not just you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.290" end="00:51:51.950" style="s2">I think that barricades of preconceived</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.590" end="00:51:54.740" style="s2">believes you know that that won&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.950" end="00:51:56.990" style="s2">the message effective and I like talked</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.740" end="00:51:58.940" style="s2">the waiter I thought about it was to try</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.990" end="00:52:02.390" style="s2">to make activities in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.940" end="00:52:04.190" style="s2">they would you know find information</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.390" end="00:52:06.490" style="s2">themselves and make their own conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.190" end="00:52:10.130" style="s2">I would like to hear you talk on that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.490" end="00:52:11.810" style="s2">well my instinct is to try to think of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.130" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">something you can do in your actual</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.810" end="00:52:16.430" style="s2">personal life that incurs a cost for you</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:18.200" style="s2">and then share that with them or tell</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.430" end="00:52:20.660" style="s2">them about it or bring it up or find</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.200" end="00:52:22.220" style="s2">some way to work that in because I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.660" end="00:52:24.260" style="s2">ultimately that that&#39;s one of the real</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.220" end="00:52:28.670" style="s2">concrete lessons of this Prezi astok or</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.260" end="00:52:31.750" style="s2">clinical tradition is that unless unless</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.670" end="00:52:34.580" style="s2">you can materialize and embody your</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.750" end="00:52:36.980" style="s2">ideas in some kind of way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.580" end="00:52:39.020" style="s2">willing to pay a price for until you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.980" end="00:52:41.180" style="s2">do that it&#39;s always going to be in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.020" end="00:52:44.210" style="s2">ethereal abstract realm of cheap talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.180" end="00:52:47.000" style="s2">and I know this is hard depending on</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.210" end="00:52:48.920" style="s2">your situation and your context there</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.000" end="00:52:50.750" style="s2">may very well not be any particularly</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.920" end="00:52:53.180" style="s2">obvious ways of doing this so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.750" end="00:52:55.940" style="s2">recognize it&#39;s not necessarily the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.180" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">easy or practical advice for some people</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.940" end="00:52:58.820" style="s2">in certain situations but then again I</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:01.400" style="s2">also think there are many</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.820" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">ways to do this there are it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.400" end="00:53:07.610" style="s2">impossible to come up with even small</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:10.190" style="s2">ways right um in some ways like in some</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.610" end="00:53:11.840" style="s2">ways the practice of kind of</p>
