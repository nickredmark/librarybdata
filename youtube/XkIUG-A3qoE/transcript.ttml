<p begin="00:18:57.040" end="00:19:03.730" style="s2">finding our flow or focus so after you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.770" end="00:19:05.350" style="s2">found the core for what I mean is you</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.730" end="00:19:08.650" style="s2">know when you&#39;ve got that state where</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:19.770" style="s2">and your focus is the one of renewing</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:22.840" style="s2">interest right rather than just hard</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.770" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">hard concentration but soft vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.840" end="00:19:27.190" style="s2">that renewing interest right then all</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:29.920" style="s2">you do is follow your breath following</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.190" end="00:19:31.900" style="s2">your breath in and out following your</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.140" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">basic the pasta so that&#39;s what it means</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.060" end="00:19:43.420" style="s2">once you&#39;ve got everything the core four</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:46.360" style="s2">set up and then you just are in the</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.100" end="00:19:58.810" style="s2">it&#39;s always good to hear from your crema</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.990" end="00:20:01.060" style="s2">I can use the five factors of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.810" end="00:20:02.830" style="s2">mindfulness on my body on bro sensations</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.060" end="00:20:05.170" style="s2">are on the emotions felt afterthought</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.830" end="00:20:07.680" style="s2">but out on pot itself are we do use it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.170" end="00:20:09.910" style="s2">on the thought please give an example I</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.680" end="00:20:12.340" style="s2">did mention that thought is the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.910" end="00:20:15.040" style="s2">thing and for a very long time what</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.340" end="00:20:16.510" style="s2">happened it might happen is you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.040" end="00:20:18.130" style="s2">either fall into the thought where you</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.510" end="00:20:21.190" style="s2">tell you try to meditate on thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.130" end="00:20:23.650" style="s2">rather than thought or it&#39;ll disappear</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.190" end="00:20:26.410" style="s2">and then your practice is what does that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.650" end="00:20:29.080" style="s2">feel like because I feel like in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.410" end="00:20:30.190" style="s2">mind when it is empty of thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.080" end="00:20:32.380" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean your mind has</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.190" end="00:20:37.060" style="s2">disappeared so that&#39;s the practice for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.380" end="00:20:39.940" style="s2">long time so when I try to meditate on</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.060" end="00:20:42.580" style="s2">the thinking and it won&#39;t last very long</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.940" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">but what I do is I catch I catch the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.580" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">voice and if it was my voice I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:50.530" style="s2">a thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:52.870" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s voice what was the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.530" end="00:20:55.990" style="s2">temperature of my mind the texture of my</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.870" end="00:20:58.600" style="s2">mind the tempo of my mind the tension in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.990" end="00:21:02.170" style="s2">my mind I try to pick up all of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.600" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">around there thinking so of like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.170" end="00:21:05.590" style="s2">what I try to use that metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">listening to the voice if it&#39;s a scene I</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.590" end="00:21:13.180" style="s2">try to step back and look at like not</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:16.030" style="s2">the meaning of the scene but the medium</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.180" end="00:21:19.240" style="s2">that was it actually in color what was I</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.030" end="00:21:21.370" style="s2">what was actually in my image how so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.240" end="00:21:23.890" style="s2">try to know you know if it was how</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.370" end="00:21:27.310" style="s2">colored it really was a vivacious it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.890" end="00:21:29.320" style="s2">really was how complete or incomplete it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.310" end="00:21:31.930" style="s2">really was things like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.320" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what typically helps people to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.930" end="00:21:35.680" style="s2">pick up on the thinking rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:36.850" style="s2">thought but like I said for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.680" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">time what will happen is you&#39;ll either</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.850" end="00:21:41.830" style="s2">go into the thought it&#39;s content or</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:43.630" style="s2">it&#39;ll disappear and then the practice is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.830" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">this is a very important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.630" end="00:21:47.950" style="s2">practice it like and you&#39;ll see this on</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.520" end="00:21:50.740" style="s2">mine next Monday it&#39;s a light when their</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.950" end="00:21:53.020" style="s2">mind is dis identified from its inner</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.230" end="00:22:19.300" style="s2">want to first of all really concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.550" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">on centering at reading and flowing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.300" end="00:22:26.650" style="s2">focusing as opposed to anything else and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">for awhile just let just label the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.650" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">distractions and return to your breath</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:33.910" style="s2">if the anxiety is becoming overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:37.030" style="s2">you might want to first direct method</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.910" end="00:22:38.770" style="s2">towards it try to befriend it trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.030" end="00:22:41.770" style="s2">try to give it a chance to speak to you</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.580" end="00:22:49.780" style="s2">might be some something more at work</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.900" end="00:22:51.670" style="s2">that needs to be addressed but very</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.780" end="00:22:54.160" style="s2">often if we&#39;re an anxiety and we can be</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.670" end="00:27:34.940" style="s2">specifically about right effort so again</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.270" end="00:27:37.890" style="s2">think about per friend they think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.940" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">in a conversation if you get that right</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.890" end="00:27:41.970" style="s2">effort if you too passive the</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.970" end="00:27:47.550" style="s2">aggressive right the conversation will</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.550" end="00:27:52.500" style="s2">or a break and you have to get that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.980" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">have to find that place or in between so</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.500" end="00:27:57.179" style="s2">again think of the befriending metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:28:00.809" style="s2">what effort would you bring to bear in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.179" end="00:28:03.000" style="s2">order to enter into a rich and loving</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.809" end="00:28:04.410" style="s2">conversation with a friend in order to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.000" end="00:28:06.630" style="s2">cultivate and deepen the friendship</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.630" end="00:28:12.390" style="s2">can bring to bear try to see if that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.270" end="00:28:14.580" style="s2">balancing your effort is reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.390" end="00:28:18.590" style="s2">tightness or detention in your forehead</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.580" end="00:28:18.590" style="s2">especially around the middle area</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.880" end="00:29:46.210" style="s2">considering teaching you some elements</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">from historic practice that have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.210" end="00:29:53.380" style="s2">more specifically do with to do with</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:55.990" style="s2">this sort of respectable training Lynne</p>

<p begin="00:30:02.049" end="00:30:09.070" style="s2">frequently to do each so I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.690" end="00:30:12.220" style="s2">initially as a sort of a strict schedule</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.070" end="00:30:15.639" style="s2">of one day one set the past nine exit</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.220" end="00:30:17.380" style="s2">meta and maybe that&#39;s one a day or two a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.639" end="00:30:19.690" style="s2">day like one of the parts the one that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.380" end="00:30:22.840" style="s2">about once one the past no one meta and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.690" end="00:30:24.340" style="s2">then maybe you should always be finding</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.840" end="00:30:26.260" style="s2">your core for like that goes without</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.340" end="00:30:28.059" style="s2">question and maybe all we set up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.260" end="00:30:29.889" style="s2">of a pasta before you do better but</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.059" end="00:30:31.659" style="s2">let&#39;s say one session dedicated to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.889" end="00:30:34.929" style="s2">pasta once I should dedicated to meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.659" end="00:30:36.279" style="s2">and then perhaps maybe once a week doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.929" end="00:30:38.440" style="s2">the meditative questioning to really</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.279" end="00:30:40.539" style="s2">strengthen the five factors of implying</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.440" end="00:30:42.760" style="s2">mindfulness and just stick to that</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.940" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">not a meta approach that of a past meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.399" end="00:30:56.380" style="s2">Praja and then perhaps on the seventh</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:57.940" style="s2">day doing the meditative question and</p>
