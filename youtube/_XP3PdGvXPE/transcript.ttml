<p begin="00:02:11.830" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">a lot of things to talk about today but</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.270" end="00:02:18.280" style="s2">why don&#39;t we start by talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:20.410" style="s2">optimistic future of humanity and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.280" end="00:02:22.270" style="s2">we need to do to transition into that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.410" end="00:02:24.730" style="s2">future there are a lot of visions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.270" end="00:02:27.580" style="s2">theories out there about the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:29.650" style="s2">macro system that we need to adopt not</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.580" end="00:02:32.590" style="s2">only to survive the century but to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.650" end="00:02:34.750" style="s2">thrive what is your vision of that first</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.590" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t talk in terms of an ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.750" end="00:02:39.340" style="s2">system talk in terms of ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:41.800" style="s2">evolution and so rather than kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.340" end="00:02:43.090" style="s2">utopian as one has previously thought of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.800" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">a perfected system we&#39;re going to think</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.090" end="00:02:49.000" style="s2">of a proto pian process right a process</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:51.010" style="s2">of emergence into more elegantly ordered</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.000" end="00:02:53.350" style="s2">complexity that has more and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.010" end="00:02:55.390" style="s2">emergent properties and more of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.350" end="00:02:57.100" style="s2">things we&#39;re interested in gets over</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.390" end="00:02:59.530" style="s2">some of the underlying causes of things</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.100" end="00:03:01.660" style="s2">we want to get past I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.530" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">rather than just iterative evolution we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.660" end="00:03:09.220" style="s2">are on the brink of a phase shift and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:13.209" style="s2">phase shift defined by core axioms and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.220" end="00:03:15.880" style="s2">core foundations of most of our macro</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.209" end="00:03:17.590" style="s2">global systems from our worldview to our</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.880" end="00:03:19.299" style="s2">economics to our governance to our</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.590" end="00:03:20.860" style="s2">infrastructure going through</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.299" end="00:03:23.769" style="s2">foundational shifts so this looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.860" end="00:03:26.410" style="s2">step function in evolution where we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.769" end="00:03:28.690" style="s2">had capitalism that has gone through</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.410" end="00:03:30.970" style="s2">kind of iterative developmental</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.690" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">processes and we&#39;ve had representative</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.970" end="00:03:34.390" style="s2">democracy that&#39;s gone through iterative</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:37.180" style="s2">developmental processes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.390" end="00:03:39.940" style="s2">scientific methodology and worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.180" end="00:03:42.989" style="s2">etc now we are on the brink of something</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.940" end="00:03:45.579" style="s2">that requires larger more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:49.510" style="s2">axiomatic and structural shift and so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.579" end="00:03:52.420" style="s2">can talk about what the criteria for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.510" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">other side of that have to look like for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.420" end="00:03:57.640" style="s2">it to be a non-self terminating system</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:04:00.760" style="s2">and for it to be a anti fragile system</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.640" end="00:04:03.579" style="s2">and those are two of the important</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.760" end="00:04:05.049" style="s2">criteria of any kind of world that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.579" end="00:04:07.269" style="s2">interesting for anyone right</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.049" end="00:04:09.370" style="s2">it is definitely non-self terminating</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.269" end="00:04:11.380" style="s2">and then not anti fragile then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.370" end="00:04:13.660" style="s2">more things we&#39;ll talk about on top of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.380" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">that so you want to talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.660" end="00:04:18.820" style="s2">those criteria must be well sure but</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:19.540" style="s2">first let&#39;s define the problem so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.820" end="00:04:20.860" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.540" end="00:04:23.170" style="s2">our current system and why do we need a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.860" end="00:04:25.990" style="s2">transition out of it so when we say our</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.170" end="00:04:27.880" style="s2">current system we are sweeping a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.990" end="00:04:30.040" style="s2">things together and it&#39;s worth kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.880" end="00:04:31.810" style="s2">pulling those apart a bit we might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.040" end="00:04:34.300" style="s2">talking about macroeconomics which</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.810" end="00:04:36.790" style="s2">obviously the macroeconomics of China</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.300" end="00:04:38.230" style="s2">and the macroeconomics of Russia and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.790" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">microeconomics to the United States if</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.230" end="00:04:45.580" style="s2">NATO are different systems but there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:49.180" style="s2">kind of beyond national global economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.580" end="00:04:51.310" style="s2">systems that we can we can look at we</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.180" end="00:04:52.810" style="s2">can look at governance systems again</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.310" end="00:04:54.760" style="s2">national and then transnational</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.810" end="00:04:56.170" style="s2">governance and then beyond anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.760" end="00:04:58.690" style="s2">that&#39;s codified how human</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.170" end="00:04:59.950" style="s2">decision-making works right we can think</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.690" end="00:05:01.210" style="s2">of governance in the highest sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.950" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">how do we do collective decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.210" end="00:05:05.800" style="s2">at various scales from a business to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">family to a nation to groups of Nations</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.800" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">to a species as a whole navigating</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">things that face the whole species</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">economics we can think about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:16.300" style="s2">do resource allocation and how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:18.100" style="s2">human incentive systems with</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.300" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">infrastructure we can talk about how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.100" end="00:05:21.100" style="s2">we meet our physical needs and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">relationship with a physical planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.100" end="00:05:27.400" style="s2">right education medicines we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:30.520" style="s2">of different systems that Co evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.400" end="00:05:34.120" style="s2">they are interconnected and Entering and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.520" end="00:05:37.150" style="s2">then you can think of a you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.120" end="00:05:38.350" style="s2">evolving paradigm that involves all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.150" end="00:05:41.340" style="s2">those things but we&#39;re gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.350" end="00:05:44.740" style="s2">talk about at least the core ones in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.340" end="00:05:46.420" style="s2">distinction from each other so what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.740" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">the problem we&#39;re trying to fix well one</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.420" end="00:05:51.670" style="s2">thing is those current systems the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:53.670" style="s2">interface of those current systems with</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.670" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">each other and the net effects are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.670" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">unsustainable and unsustainable means</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.159" end="00:18:29.059" style="s2">people to do the jobs Smith talked about</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.470" end="00:18:32.749" style="s2">this Marx that everybody there is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.059" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">the core of economic theory so if you do</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.749" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">some kind of communism where everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.529" style="s2">needs are met by the system then how do</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">you get the people to do the shitty jobs</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.529" end="00:18:43.070" style="s2">well then the state has to force them</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:45.799" style="s2">and we call that imperialism is why we</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.070" end="00:18:47.149" style="s2">don&#39;t like communism right or everyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.799" end="00:18:48.980" style="s2">has to do an equal amount but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.149" end="00:18:50.450" style="s2">still the who is gonna enforce us take</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.980" end="00:18:51.769" style="s2">that so enforce them so capitalism says</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.450" end="00:18:53.509" style="s2">no no we&#39;ll let the free market enforce</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.769" end="00:18:55.909" style="s2">them right which is if they don&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.509" end="00:18:58.549" style="s2">shitty jobs they just go homeless that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.909" end="00:19:01.100" style="s2">really not freedom still it just moved</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.549" end="00:19:04.190" style="s2">the forcing function from the state to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.100" end="00:19:07.119" style="s2">market right well as we&#39;re moving into</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.190" end="00:19:10.149" style="s2">technological automation this</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.119" end="00:19:12.289" style="s2">foundational axiom of all economic</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.149" end="00:19:14.059" style="s2">theories which is how do we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.289" end="00:19:17.690" style="s2">the labor economy right this this is an</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.059" end="00:19:19.789" style="s2">axiomatic topic is being obsoleted we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.690" end="00:19:22.789" style="s2">obsoleting that all of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.789" end="00:19:25.850" style="s2">that Marx and Smith and friends had and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.789" end="00:19:29.389" style="s2">so that both solves problems and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.850" end="00:19:31.909" style="s2">brings new ones so when we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.389" end="00:19:35.210" style="s2">technological automation that is capable</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.909" end="00:19:36.590" style="s2">of automating the shitty jobs and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.210" end="00:19:38.299" style="s2">important to get when I say that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that the machines are going</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.299" end="00:19:41.070" style="s2">to take your jobs and you can&#39;t garden</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:42.570" style="s2">if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.070" end="00:19:43.950" style="s2">in garden or wash your toilet if</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.570" end="00:19:45.420" style="s2">you want to you just don&#39;t have to wash</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.950" end="00:19:46.770" style="s2">your toilet all the time because you we</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.420" end="00:19:49.290" style="s2">can make bathrooms that clean themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.770" end="00:19:51.030" style="s2">better right and then if you just want</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.290" end="00:19:52.560" style="s2">to do that you&#39;re welcome to human</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.030" end="00:19:54.330" style="s2">freedom can absolutely do that if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.560" end="00:19:56.730" style="s2">want a garden you&#39;re welcome to do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.330" end="00:19:59.310" style="s2">but can we create vertical agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.730" end="00:20:00.840" style="s2">systems that automate many aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.310" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">that while providing high-quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.840" end="00:20:05.550" style="s2">nutritious food with lower impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:07.980" style="s2">environment yes we can right and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.550" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">opens up more human freedom not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.980" end="00:20:12.090" style="s2">the other so as long as we have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:13.680" style="s2">situation where the jobs need the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.090" end="00:20:16.110" style="s2">then we have to make it where the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.680" end="00:20:18.900" style="s2">also need the jobs ie capitalism right</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.110" end="00:20:21.210" style="s2">which is why that system has you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.900" end="00:20:22.770" style="s2">succeeded in a Darwinian sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.210" end="00:20:26.010" style="s2">way that it has it&#39;s important to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.770" end="00:20:28.410" style="s2">that Darwinian selection does not select</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.010" end="00:20:31.860" style="s2">for the true the good and the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.410" end="00:20:34.280" style="s2">right it selects for what is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.860" end="00:20:37.140" style="s2">which means what is dominant within</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.280" end="00:20:38.910" style="s2">scarcity dynamics now even if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.140" end="00:20:40.110" style="s2">gonna you know be going extinct in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.910" end="00:20:41.850" style="s2">very near future because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.110" end="00:20:44.940" style="s2">forecasting it&#39;s not adequately</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.850" end="00:20:46.470" style="s2">forecasting right as soon as you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.940" end="00:20:49.080" style="s2">make it to where the jobs don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.470" end="00:20:50.280" style="s2">people the automation you can also make</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.080" end="00:20:52.110" style="s2">it where the people don&#39;t need the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.280" end="00:20:54.540" style="s2">which is what the Commonwealth economics</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.110" end="00:20:57.690" style="s2">is moving towards in a first step in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.540" end="00:20:59.490" style="s2">direction is the basic income basic</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.690" end="00:21:02.940" style="s2">income is not enough but it is a step</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.490" end="00:21:04.650" style="s2">and the key for it not to be a welfare</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.940" end="00:21:07.260" style="s2">system when we think about the problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.650" end="00:21:09.780" style="s2">of the welfare system and how you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.260" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have the Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.780" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">motive to create the capitalism gave</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:15.270" style="s2">them so they just sit on the couch and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:17.730" style="s2">smoke crack all day those are people</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.270" end="00:21:19.500" style="s2">that have already been broken this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.730" end="00:21:21.900" style="s2">very important point when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.500" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">little children they&#39;re asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.900" end="00:21:26.160" style="s2">all day long why is fire hot why is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:28.440" style="s2">sky blue where do we go after we die</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.160" end="00:21:30.570" style="s2">where you know they&#39;re fascinated asking</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.440" end="00:21:33.150" style="s2">deep philosophic and physics and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.570" end="00:21:34.770" style="s2">know etc questions and they want to help</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.150" end="00:21:37.440" style="s2">do stuff and they want to build stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.770" end="00:21:38.910" style="s2">and they and then we don&#39;t answer those</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.440" end="00:21:40.620" style="s2">questions because why the is fire</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.910" end="00:21:41.970" style="s2">hot that&#39;s actually a very deep physics</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.620" end="00:21:44.160" style="s2">question and then it&#39;s moving from</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.970" end="00:21:45.960" style="s2">physics to consciousness studies let the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.160" end="00:21:47.640" style="s2">mind brain interface of subjective</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.960" end="00:21:50.010" style="s2">experience of hotness with photons on</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.640" end="00:21:52.100" style="s2">the skin and nerve pathways and so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.010" end="00:21:55.700" style="s2">say I don&#39;t know spell cat</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.100" end="00:21:57.680" style="s2">we don&#39;t facilitate their interests</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.700" end="00:21:59.390" style="s2">while forcing them to be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.680" end="00:22:01.130" style="s2">completely uninteresting and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.390" end="00:22:02.570" style="s2">thereby breaking their interest in life</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.130" end="00:22:05.780" style="s2">so then they just want to veg the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.570" end="00:22:07.460" style="s2">out right and so now we have broken</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.780" end="00:22:09.680" style="s2">humans or if they can just veg out they</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.460" end="00:22:11.660" style="s2">will but this is not human nature this</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.680" end="00:22:15.350" style="s2">is broken humans in a system that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.660" end="00:22:18.860" style="s2">systematically breaks humans and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.350" end="00:22:21.050" style="s2">very important to get that in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.860" end="00:22:22.070" style="s2">of economic system that we&#39;re proposing</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.050" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.070" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">education system that&#39;s possible because</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:27.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to prepare kids for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:29.930" style="s2">workforce and since we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.800" end="00:22:33.050" style="s2">prepare them for the workforce the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.930" end="00:22:37.010" style="s2">goal of education becomes identifying</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.050" end="00:22:39.140" style="s2">the unique aptitude and interest and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.010" end="00:22:41.540" style="s2">fascination and inclination of each</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.140" end="00:22:44.420" style="s2">child and facilitating the out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.540" end="00:22:45.560" style="s2">it and realizing that they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.420" end="00:22:47.660" style="s2">actually be able to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.560" end="00:22:48.590" style="s2">because we&#39;ve automated a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.660" end="00:22:52.040" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve shared a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.590" end="00:22:53.390" style="s2">right but what they can uniquely do and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.040" end="00:22:55.340" style="s2">what they can light up the most and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.390" end="00:22:57.350" style="s2">uniquely doing and then have the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.340" end="00:22:59.320" style="s2">of that be fully available to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.350" end="00:23:01.670" style="s2">in a Commonwealth economics that makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.320" end="00:23:03.710" style="s2">radically more abundance possible then</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.670" end="00:23:05.240" style="s2">for everyone then is actually possible</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.670" end="00:23:18.650" style="s2">required in this post-birth sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.730" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">society I&#39;m going to call it I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.650" end="00:23:23.900" style="s2">people are optimizers so it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:26.150" style="s2">picking the route or direction that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.900" end="00:23:28.130" style="s2">want to go to and then make that part of</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.130" end="00:23:30.650" style="s2">I myself do that with every aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.050" end="00:23:32.780" style="s2">our lives</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.650" end="00:23:35.510" style="s2">with our website with you know I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.780" end="00:23:37.670" style="s2">an efficiency optimizer no doubt people</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.510" end="00:23:38.810" style="s2">when they find what their calling is</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.670" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">what they want to be doing they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.810" end="00:23:43.490" style="s2">spend a lot of time doing exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:45.380" style="s2">in in the grander scale the way you say</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.490" end="00:23:48.050" style="s2">the incentives are all out of whack</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.380" end="00:23:49.580" style="s2">yeah ad motivates them to learn which in</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.050" end="00:23:51.290" style="s2">turn D motivates them to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.580" end="00:23:53.900" style="s2">anything which is exactly what this new</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.290" end="00:23:54.800" style="s2">system needs and since you identify as</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.800" end="00:23:57.950" style="s2">then you think of it through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:00.140" style="s2">that they&#39;ll all be optimizing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.950" end="00:24:02.420" style="s2">good lens someone else would say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.140" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">they will all be creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.420" end="00:24:05.930" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s me while they map to each</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.120" end="00:24:29.570" style="s2">and there will be other people for whom</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.300" end="00:24:43.160" style="s2">produced and one of the beautiful things</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.210" end="00:24:45.590" style="s2">is that&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.160" end="00:24:46.910" style="s2">in a macroeconomic system where you say</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.590" end="00:24:49.820" style="s2">how do you turn that into the dollars</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.910" end="00:24:51.620" style="s2">you need to live in a macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.820" end="00:24:54.140" style="s2">system where that&#39;s not the question</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.620" end="00:24:57.080" style="s2">there is a important difference between</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.140" end="00:24:59.840" style="s2">appreciable wealth and exchangeable</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.080" end="00:25:03.110" style="s2">wealth when we think about a rainbow</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.840" end="00:25:05.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not extractable and exchangeable</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.110" end="00:25:07.580" style="s2">wealth for anyone seeing a rainbow when</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.450" end="00:25:09.380" style="s2">you think about hearing a song when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.580" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">think about somebody complimenting you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.380" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">seeing a smile like none of these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:15.950" style="s2">things you can put on a balance sheet in</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:18.260" style="s2">any metrical way but when you think</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.950" end="00:25:19.880" style="s2">about what makes life most rich it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.260" end="00:25:22.250" style="s2">largely these things that fit into</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.880" end="00:25:25.880" style="s2">appreciable but not quantifiable wealth</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.250" end="00:25:29.060" style="s2">and so one of the beautiful things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.880" end="00:25:30.380" style="s2">happens when the primary balance sheet</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.060" end="00:25:32.630" style="s2">that we&#39;re paying attention to is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.380" end="00:25:33.800" style="s2">balance sheet of the Commons the natural</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.450" end="00:25:40.690" style="s2">without possessing is that we have a</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.690" end="00:25:46.730" style="s2">appreciable wealth generation because</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.220" end="00:25:49.430" style="s2">we&#39;re not only focused on exchangeable</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.730" end="00:25:51.050" style="s2">wealth accounting systems I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.430" end="00:25:53.240" style="s2">already seeing that a little bit with</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.050" end="00:25:55.580" style="s2">the Internet where people are producing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.240" end="00:25:58.790" style="s2">you know they&#39;re producing music they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.580" end="00:26:01.310" style="s2">making memes they&#39;re writing blogs but</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.790" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2">they&#39;re not really most of the time</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.850" end="00:26:08.270" style="s2">exciting for them or they they get some</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.830" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">sort of satisfaction out of just</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.270" end="00:26:13.130" style="s2">producing it and putting it out there</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:16.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s accessible to the world of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.130" end="00:26:20.169" style="s2">internet now while those people</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.460" end="00:26:22.130" style="s2">still have to work their day job to</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.130" end="00:26:25.309" style="s2">gonna come to their music and their day</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.419" end="00:26:26.659" style="s2">job might happen to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.309" end="00:26:28.039" style="s2">they experience is relatively</p>

<p begin="00:26:28.039" end="00:26:31.970" style="s2">they know how to access then they come</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.200" end="00:26:33.230" style="s2">to that little bit of music you think</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.970" end="00:26:35.419" style="s2">about what would happen if we just</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:38.240" style="s2">supported them to be in the position to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.419" end="00:26:40.909" style="s2">do music as deeply as they could wanted</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.240" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">to right and what if they didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.909" end="00:26:43.730" style="s2">try and gear it towards what was</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:44.870" style="s2">sellable so that they could then switch</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.730" end="00:26:47.470" style="s2">from the soul-crushing to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.870" end="00:26:50.450" style="s2">money-making music but what was really</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.470" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">authentically what they felt was their</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.450" end="00:26:54.620" style="s2">greatest offering you know their most</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:56.750" style="s2">unique offering we had a very different</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.620" end="00:26:58.690" style="s2">kind of creativity happening one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.750" end="00:27:03.559" style="s2">issues right now we see in this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.559" end="00:27:07.820" style="s2">and what is not fake news and what one</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.779" end="00:27:09.289" style="s2">of the issues of the inability to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.820" end="00:27:13.100" style="s2">sense of almost anything that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.289" end="00:27:15.980" style="s2">facing is how much of any news that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.100" end="00:27:18.620" style="s2">find or any idea has some financial</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.980" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">interest associated with it how much</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.620" end="00:27:23.960" style="s2">education is an advertorial</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:26.360" style="s2">you know in some way how much of science</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.960" end="00:27:28.399" style="s2">itself is actually just are in the arm</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.360" end="00:27:31.450" style="s2">of capitalism funded by something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.399" end="00:27:34.549" style="s2">has a vested interest attached and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.450" end="00:27:36.679" style="s2">this is a very tricky process right</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.549" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">where what we can actually believe in</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.679" end="00:27:41.899" style="s2">and then how much of music is geared</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:44.809" style="s2">towards what is going to have the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.899" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">kinds of frames for me mobility so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.809" end="00:27:48.860" style="s2">it can get puppy enough to sell Pepsi or</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:50.779" style="s2">whatever rather than what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.860" end="00:27:51.740" style="s2">what someone most authentically wants to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.779" end="00:27:53.450" style="s2">create that other people&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.740" end="00:27:54.620" style="s2">authentically want to experience you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.450" end="00:27:57.549" style="s2">think about what it means to create</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.620" end="00:28:02.330" style="s2">systems that remove all of those other</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.549" end="00:28:04.909" style="s2">agendas so that there are no vested</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.330" end="00:28:07.059" style="s2">interest agendas so now you know we</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.909" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">talked about that the criteria from</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.059" end="00:28:11.720" style="s2">infrastructure what that had to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:13.510" style="s2">here&#39;s the criteria for social systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.720" end="00:28:15.380" style="s2">we said governance is decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.510" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">economics is decision making an</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.380" end="00:28:19.820" style="s2">incentive but we just started to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.880" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">hint at that the incentive moves from</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.820" end="00:28:24.110" style="s2">primarily extrinsic incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:25.610" style="s2">intrinsic incentive and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.110" end="00:28:26.600" style="s2">system that&#39;s all about facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.610" end="00:28:29.120" style="s2">intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.600" end="00:28:31.100" style="s2">generative incentive right which D</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.120" end="00:28:33.770" style="s2">necessitates most of extrinsic incentive</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.100" end="00:28:35.059" style="s2">which becomes key then economics is</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.770" end="00:28:37.100" style="s2">largely about resource allocation</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.059" end="00:28:39.049" style="s2">systems optimization of resource</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.100" end="00:28:39.710" style="s2">allocation towards all the various goals</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.049" end="00:28:42.770" style="s2">that matter</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.710" end="00:28:44.590" style="s2">so most decision-making in you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.770" end="00:28:47.570" style="s2">governance is around resource decisions</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.590" end="00:28:48.919" style="s2">law is how do we make sure that those</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.570" end="00:28:50.419" style="s2">decisions actually get follow through so</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.919" end="00:28:53.030" style="s2">we can actually think of economics as</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.419" end="00:28:55.640" style="s2">the heart of social systems right so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.030" end="00:28:57.410" style="s2">key criteria for the future of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.640" end="00:29:00.710" style="s2">macroeconomics is that all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.410" end="00:29:02.929" style="s2">externalities get internalized meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.710" end="00:29:05.690" style="s2">everything that we affect by a decision</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.929" end="00:29:09.110" style="s2">is factored in the decision making</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.690" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">process and the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.110" end="00:29:13.490" style="s2">resources get conferred to things so</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:17.480" style="s2">another way to say this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.490" end="00:29:19.490" style="s2">agency the incentive of every agent</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.480" end="00:29:20.840" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a person or a group of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.490" end="00:29:23.150" style="s2">people called a company or a country</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.840" end="00:29:25.220" style="s2">even though I believe both of those two</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.150" end="00:29:27.559" style="s2">things will become obsolete just think</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.220" end="00:29:30.289" style="s2">any person or group of people any agent</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.559" end="00:29:33.049" style="s2">the incentive of that agent has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.289" end="00:29:35.270" style="s2">perfectly aligned with the well-being of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.049" end="00:29:37.640" style="s2">every other agent and of the Commons as</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.270" end="00:29:41.510" style="s2">a whole the degree to which the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.640" end="00:29:43.580" style="s2">individual agents are incentivized to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.510" end="00:29:45.230" style="s2">something that is external izing harm to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.580" end="00:29:47.150" style="s2">other agents of the Commons is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.230" end="00:29:49.130" style="s2">degree to which those problematic</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.150" end="00:29:51.500" style="s2">externalities will continue to happen to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.130" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">acquit ously in a decentralized fashion</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.500" end="00:29:56.090" style="s2">at scale because they are incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:58.070" style="s2">in decentralized fashion at scale that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.090" end="00:29:59.809" style="s2">the key of the future of macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.070" end="00:30:02.630" style="s2">is the alignment of agency and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.809" end="00:30:05.539" style="s2">well-being from individuals and Commons</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.630" end="00:30:06.890" style="s2">and that correlates with closing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.539" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">loop right we talked about a linear</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.890" end="00:30:10.220" style="s2">materials economy moving to a closed</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:13.070" style="s2">loop one right in the same way here</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.010" end="00:38:02.430" style="s2">has been breaking and really broken for</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.430" end="00:38:09.210" style="s2">obvious breakage and so we see a</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.210" end="00:38:13.470" style="s2">kind of vested interests that it has</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.340" end="00:38:17.010" style="s2">co-evolved with and you know damaged</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.310" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">forward and so a candidate that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.310" end="00:38:47.370" style="s2">represented change by being outside of</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:49.670" style="s2">the system won even though in so many</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.670" end="00:38:57.830" style="s2">so the two-party system as a whole broke</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.010" end="00:39:02.100" style="s2">each of the major platforms broke and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.830" end="00:39:05.910" style="s2">we&#39;re a very relatively small percentage</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:21.579" style="s2">that just going to the polls and voting</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:23.529" style="s2">is an adequate solution to the</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.529" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">so what that portends for future</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.759" end="00:39:31.410" style="s2">election cycles and also how people</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:33.430" style="s2">start to have civic engagement</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.410" end="00:39:34.869" style="s2">independent of elections is all</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.430" end="00:39:36.990" style="s2">interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.869" end="00:39:41.140" style="s2">you know Trump is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.990" end="00:39:44.170" style="s2">person in this position with the cabinet</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.140" end="00:39:46.210" style="s2">that&#39;s coming because there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.170" end="00:39:47.710" style="s2">really concerning things right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.210" end="00:39:51.940" style="s2">plenty of really concerning things in</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.710" end="00:39:55.000" style="s2">terms of the embolden &#39;try that has</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.940" end="00:39:56.680" style="s2">already been here you know so deeply but</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.000" end="00:40:00.220" style="s2">that in being brought to the light and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.680" end="00:40:03.069" style="s2">the surface and and embolden that way is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.220" end="00:40:04.690" style="s2">both more concerning more problematic</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.069" end="00:40:07.809" style="s2">but also more capable of being healed</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.690" end="00:40:12.490" style="s2">because it&#39;s up more obvious represents</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.809" end="00:40:17.650" style="s2">an existential catastrophic view on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.490" end="00:40:20.049" style="s2">climate and energy but is also starting</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.650" end="00:40:21.490" style="s2">to be surrounded by some people that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.049" end="00:40:24.700" style="s2">have meaningfully better perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.490" end="00:40:27.579" style="s2">like Elon Musk and others so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.700" end="00:40:30.730" style="s2">there is influence potential there but</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.579" end="00:40:33.880" style="s2">we also see things like really seeking</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.730" end="00:40:37.930" style="s2">to remove people from office who have</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.880" end="00:40:41.619" style="s2">had crony capitalists ties for such a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.930" end="00:40:43.630" style="s2">long time and propose things like</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.619" end="00:40:46.420" style="s2">auditing the Fed that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.630" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">revolutionary revolutionary and in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.420" end="00:40:52.180" style="s2">good way and so it&#39;s very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:53.559" style="s2">see what could happen over the next time</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.180" end="00:40:55.990" style="s2">here to here but what we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.559" end="00:40:57.069" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s look at it from a larger</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.990" end="00:40:58.750" style="s2">sense because similar things are</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.069" end="00:41:01.750" style="s2">happening in other places in the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.750" end="00:41:04.740" style="s2">right not just in politics but in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.750" end="00:41:09.009" style="s2">failure of several developed countries</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.740" end="00:41:11.049" style="s2">economic systems and you know etc if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.009" end="00:41:13.259" style="s2">think about it in terms of systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.049" end="00:41:15.670" style="s2">theory and complex adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.259" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of foundational principle</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.670" end="00:41:22.299" style="s2">that says complexity will evolve within</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:23.099" style="s2">any organizational system inexorably</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.299" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">just because</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.099" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">there&#39;s movement and with movement there</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.380" style="s2">are self interacting dynamics and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:31.140" style="s2">going to lead to increased complexity</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.380" end="00:41:34.170" style="s2">right and so complex is going to involve</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.140" end="00:41:37.140" style="s2">within any organizational system until</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.170" end="00:41:42.269" style="s2">it actually exceeds that organizational</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.140" end="00:41:43.589" style="s2">systems capacity to manage and when it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.269" end="00:41:45.749" style="s2">exceeds it you&#39;re gonna start getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.589" end="00:41:48.269" style="s2">increased chaos and then increased</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.749" end="00:41:51.450" style="s2">entropy and then the dissolution of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.269" end="00:41:53.239" style="s2">organizational system and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.450" end="00:41:56.609" style="s2">either going to get the entropic</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.239" end="00:42:00.210" style="s2">step-down to the previous level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.609" end="00:42:02.039" style="s2">organization or out of the chaos you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.210" end="00:42:04.019" style="s2">the emergence of a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.039" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">organization that isn&#39;t a retrofit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.019" end="00:42:09.299" style="s2">the previous system but a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:13.160" style="s2">new kind of system that&#39;s a place that</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.299" end="00:42:15.720" style="s2">globally I would say we&#39;re at we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.160" end="00:42:18.930" style="s2">you know representative democracy is</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.720" end="00:42:21.660" style="s2">just fundamentally not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.930" end="00:42:23.220" style="s2">handling the kinds of collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.660" end="00:42:26.190" style="s2">decision-making we need to make right</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.220" end="00:42:29.249" style="s2">now when you think about the founding of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.190" end="00:42:32.130" style="s2">the United States and the time when</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.249" end="00:42:34.619" style="s2">people would get together in a town hall</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.130" end="00:42:36.450" style="s2">without representative decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.619" end="00:42:37.859" style="s2">right they get together and all vote on</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.450" end="00:42:40.950" style="s2">something and then someone would have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.859" end="00:42:42.599" style="s2">be represent the whole group who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.950" end="00:42:44.219" style="s2">ride a horse to where all the other town</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.599" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">halls met to decide what the state did</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.219" end="00:42:48.329" style="s2">or it made sense to have representatives</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:49.710" style="s2">for very real technologic limits you</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.329" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">know and there were other reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.710" end="00:42:53.460" style="s2">were argued but that was a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:55.319" style="s2">etiology of the whole thing right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.460" end="00:42:56.969" style="s2">then when you couldn&#39;t have a town hall</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.319" end="00:43:00.269" style="s2">big enough for the whole population and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.969" end="00:43:01.979" style="s2">so we have an Internet Town Hall</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.269" end="00:43:05.219" style="s2">beginning for the whole population</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.979" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">nobody has to ride a horse we have we</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.219" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">don&#39;t need the representatives in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:11.910" style="s2">same way we have people that actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">have real topic matter expertise that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.910" end="00:43:17.549" style="s2">can be groups of decentralized</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.150" end="00:45:51.539" style="s2">process you get discrete phase shift</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.769" end="00:46:21.720" style="s2">rather than on the liability side so</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:23.630" style="s2">what kind of things can we do as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.720" end="00:46:26.849" style="s2">civilization to kind of aid in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.630" end="00:46:29.910" style="s2">midwifery process to allow for this baby</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.849" end="00:46:34.619" style="s2">to be born any of the places where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.910" end="00:46:36.440" style="s2">can help close major open loops and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.619" end="00:46:39.259" style="s2">do it in ways that can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.440" end="00:46:42.599" style="s2">scalability are things worth looking at</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.259" end="00:46:47.670" style="s2">so if you think about infrastructure the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.599" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">ability to change production and waste</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.670" end="00:46:52.049" style="s2">management manufacturing to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:53.759" style="s2">closed-loop process so you start</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.049" end="00:46:57.349" style="s2">thinking about could we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.759" end="00:47:00.869" style="s2">decentralized systems of 3d 4d printing</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.349" end="00:47:02.910" style="s2">with modular upgradability built in</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.869" end="00:47:05.480" style="s2">rather than designed in obsolescence and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.910" end="00:47:07.739" style="s2">proprietary nonsense built in and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.480" end="00:47:10.980" style="s2">cradle-to-cradle design built in and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.739" end="00:47:13.170" style="s2">then have them connected to recycling</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.980" end="00:47:14.880" style="s2">systems that move to lower entropy and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.170" end="00:47:17.609" style="s2">higher efficiency moving eventually</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:19.920" style="s2">towards things like atomic sorting where</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.609" end="00:47:21.690" style="s2">then the old things get to be brought</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.920" end="00:47:24.660" style="s2">back into the individual parts to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.690" end="00:47:27.930" style="s2">new things all run on renewable energy</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.660" end="00:47:30.869" style="s2">sources low toxicity low entropy</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.930" end="00:47:33.779" style="s2">renewable energy sources on the biologic</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.869" end="00:47:36.509" style="s2">side of that stem-cell meet the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.779" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2">farming the synthetic biology as part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.509" end="00:47:40.739" style="s2">the you know creative materials process</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:43.020" style="s2">and then the waste management of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.739" end="00:47:45.660" style="s2">organic fractions it involves anaerobic</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.020" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">algae scrubbers etc and so there is no</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.660" end="00:47:49.890" style="s2">waste there is no raw material sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:52.050" style="s2">that isn&#39;t particularly building those</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.890" end="00:47:54.420" style="s2">systems and not just individual</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.050" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">technologies but those the Guild&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.420" end="00:47:58.920" style="s2">ecosystems of those technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:02.550" style="s2">lead to closed-loop sustainability of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.920" end="00:48:05.070" style="s2">that system and then scalability of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.550" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">those systems that is stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.070" end="00:48:09.869" style="s2">worth building so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.060" style="s2">building the future of our social</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.869" end="00:48:15.150" style="s2">systems and knowing that the goal of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.060" end="00:48:17.310" style="s2">social systems has to be aligning the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.150" end="00:48:19.290" style="s2">incentive of agents with the well-being</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.310" end="00:48:21.300" style="s2">of other agents in the Commons start</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.290" end="00:48:24.030" style="s2">thinking about how to close the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.300" end="00:48:28.590" style="s2">incentive wellbeing gap how to close the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.030" end="00:48:30.930" style="s2">externality gap then building ways to</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.590" end="00:48:32.940" style="s2">measure externalities and just see them</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.930" end="00:48:34.650" style="s2">to then be able to quantify them and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.940" end="00:48:36.630" style="s2">internalize them those are technologies</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.650" end="00:48:39.510" style="s2">worth building right to be able to build</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.630" end="00:48:41.100" style="s2">a balance sheet of the Commons the built</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.510" end="00:48:43.290" style="s2">world Commons the natural world Commons</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.100" end="00:48:46.710" style="s2">to be able to have data mined sources as</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.290" end="00:48:49.980" style="s2">well as repurpose the IOT sensor systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.710" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">to have real-time sensor driven balance</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.980" end="00:48:53.220" style="s2">sheet of the Commons right so then we</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:55.230" style="s2">can see where the Commons are net</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.220" end="00:48:57.180" style="s2">increasing and their resilience versus</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.230" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">decreasing where they&#39;re decreasing what</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.180" end="00:49:01.619" style="s2">actions by what you know players are</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:03.030" style="s2">involved in that and you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.619" end="00:49:06.420" style="s2">really quantify it those are things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.030" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">should happen starting to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.420" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">things like robotic automation of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:14.310" style="s2">shitty jobs that does allow the ability</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.160" end="00:49:15.990" style="s2">to have things like a Commonwealth</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.310" end="00:49:17.460" style="s2">economics really start to emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.990" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">then looking at the accounting systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.460" end="00:49:22.170" style="s2">of how a Commonwealth economics access</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:23.670" style="s2">based systems rather than possession</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.170" end="00:49:26.280" style="s2">based systems so when you start to think</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.670" end="00:49:28.500" style="s2">about people&#39;s access to Ober rather</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.280" end="00:49:31.160" style="s2">than owning a car if you had an uber</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.500" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">system where there were enough cars in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.160" end="00:49:37.890" style="s2">close proximity for peak time that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:39.660" style="s2">total amount of cars that have to be in</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.890" end="00:49:41.100" style="s2">the system that&#39;s still something like</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.660" end="00:49:42.359" style="s2">that twentieth of the amount of cars</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.100" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">that are in systems where people drive</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.359" end="00:49:45.300" style="s2">themselves in the car spend ninety five</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:47.130" style="s2">percent of their time sitting that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.300" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">lot less resource taken out of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.130" end="00:49:52.740" style="s2">for actually more utility value safety</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:53.910" style="s2">etc and the transportation system</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.740" end="00:49:55.360" style="s2">especially as part it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.910" end="00:49:57.580" style="s2">self-driving and then</p>

<p begin="00:54:05.600" end="00:54:12.800" style="s2">if you think about the way most people</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.780" end="00:54:15.320" style="s2">have been raised as children we very</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.800" end="00:54:17.339" style="s2">rarely got punished for doing what that</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.320" end="00:54:19.710" style="s2">authorities wanted us to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.339" end="00:54:21.420" style="s2">and most all of the times we got</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.710" end="00:54:24.269" style="s2">punished or for doing things that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.420" end="00:54:26.940" style="s2">wanted to that maybe appeal to our own</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.269" end="00:54:30.690" style="s2">sensibilities or desires intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.940" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">feelings and most of the time that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.690" end="00:54:35.099" style="s2">got praised and rewarded was for doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:37.799" style="s2">things the authorities either wanted us</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.099" end="00:54:39.569" style="s2">to do or you know we&#39;re at least aligned</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.799" end="00:54:41.489" style="s2">with what they figured what we figured</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.489" end="00:54:45.119" style="s2">want us to do and so this is a very deep</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.849" end="00:54:59.609" style="s2">authorities to tell us how to live our</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.099" end="00:55:01.019" style="s2">lives and when we touched our bodies we</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.609" end="00:55:02.579" style="s2">found that the parts of our bodies that</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.019" end="00:55:05.359" style="s2">felt best to touch with the parts that</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.579" end="00:55:08.190" style="s2">we got most in trouble for touching so</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.359" end="00:55:10.559" style="s2">obviously what feels good to us is bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.190" end="00:55:13.019" style="s2">so we can&#39;t trust our feelings but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:14.460" style="s2">authorities know that it&#39;s bad so we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.019" end="00:55:17.460" style="s2">apparently trust the authorities but not</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.460" end="00:55:19.769" style="s2">our feelings and no one was ever really</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.460" end="00:55:22.859" style="s2">interested in our thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.769" end="00:55:24.329" style="s2">perspectives they were pre-defined right</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.859" end="00:55:26.039" style="s2">answers to things and we got praised</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.329" end="00:55:28.140" style="s2">when we got them and we got in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.039" end="00:55:29.809" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t get them and people were</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.140" end="00:55:32.039" style="s2">not generally interested in our</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.809" end="00:55:33.719" style="s2">aesthetic and design ideas they were</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.719" end="00:55:38.249" style="s2">that were someone else&#39;s design ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.369" end="00:55:41.249" style="s2">and so we got conditioned very deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.249" end="00:55:44.339" style="s2">that system that is part of the system</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.249" end="00:55:48.930" style="s2">that is self terminating because most</p>

<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:26.130" style="s2">anger or jaded Ness but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.579" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">believe in their own ability to find</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.130" end="00:56:30.810" style="s2">solutions to figure out so they</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:33.420" style="s2">just numb out</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.810" end="00:56:36.420" style="s2">alcohol or on TV or whatever they do and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.420" end="00:56:38.970" style="s2">so when you look at the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.420" end="00:56:40.620" style="s2">ever meaningfully moved the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.970" end="00:56:42.030" style="s2">forward where they solved some problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.620" end="00:56:43.770" style="s2">that had not been solved it really</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.030" end="00:56:45.480" style="s2">needed to be solved nobody taught them</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.770" end="00:56:46.620" style="s2">how to do it because no one clicks the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.480" end="00:56:48.330" style="s2">problem wasn&#39;t solved yet</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.620" end="00:56:49.740" style="s2">nobody could have taught Edison how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.330" end="00:56:51.690" style="s2">make a light bulb nobody could have told</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.740" end="00:56:54.630" style="s2">Gandhi how to get home rule for India</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.690" end="00:56:57.600" style="s2">and one of the fascinating things was</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.630" end="00:56:59.460" style="s2">that they decided to do it because they</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.600" end="00:57:03.030" style="s2">knew that it was important before having</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.460" end="00:57:05.850" style="s2">any idea how to do it and then they</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.030" end="00:57:07.830" style="s2">trusted in both the rightness of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.850" end="00:57:10.800" style="s2">enough and their own capability to learn</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.830" end="00:57:13.140" style="s2">enough to really apply themselves deeply</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.800" end="00:57:16.220" style="s2">and to continue through all of the early</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.140" end="00:57:18.780" style="s2">not successes until they found stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.220" end="00:57:21.630" style="s2">what I would encourage young people to</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.780" end="00:57:25.110" style="s2">do is to take profound responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.630" end="00:57:27.210" style="s2">for their existence and to know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.110" end="00:57:28.680" style="s2">there are a lot of people and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.210" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">books and a lot of courses that have</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.680" end="00:57:33.660" style="s2">valuable to teach them but if an</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:35.190" style="s2">adequate answer to what they should do</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.660" end="00:57:37.170" style="s2">with their life existed anywhere that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.190" end="00:57:39.060" style="s2">whole thing would be done already and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.170" end="00:57:40.860" style="s2">the fact that the things aren&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.060" end="00:57:42.930" style="s2">means that all the best teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.860" end="00:57:44.610" style="s2">thinkers have not gotta get right they</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.930" end="00:57:47.000" style="s2">have ideas they have things to learn you</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.610" end="00:57:49.110" style="s2">should absolutely learn from them and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.000" end="00:57:51.000" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have something to add</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.110" end="00:57:53.820" style="s2">not only in terms of your work but also</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.000" end="00:57:57.540" style="s2">in terms of your creativity so I would</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.820" end="00:58:00.950" style="s2">say look around at the world and see all</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.540" end="00:58:04.650" style="s2">of the things that really bother you and</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.950" end="00:58:06.720" style="s2">realize that them bothering you as part</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.650" end="00:58:08.850" style="s2">of your guidance and see all the things</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.720" end="00:58:09.930" style="s2">that you really love all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.850" end="00:58:12.060" style="s2">are beautiful and you realize they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.930" end="00:58:14.820" style="s2">connected right animals are beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.060" end="00:58:16.200" style="s2">and then all of the devastation of</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.820" end="00:58:17.550" style="s2">animals and their habitat is really</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.200" end="00:58:19.080" style="s2">bothersome people are beautiful so</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.550" end="00:58:21.810" style="s2">homelessness and order bothers them</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.080" end="00:58:24.870" style="s2">right you children are beautiful so bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.810" end="00:58:27.240" style="s2">education systems are bothersome so look</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.870" end="00:58:30.990" style="s2">at what you love look at how what you</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.240" end="00:58:34.500" style="s2">love is not well supported in various</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.990" end="00:58:35.430" style="s2">areas and realize that it does not have</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.500" end="00:58:37.290" style="s2">to be that way</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.430" end="00:58:38.970" style="s2">any more than the world had to stay dark</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.290" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">in the time of Edison</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.970" end="00:58:44.100" style="s2">and yet for all of human history before</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:45.330" style="s2">Edison it did right and taking on</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.100" end="00:58:47.010" style="s2">something that seemed impossible</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.330" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">literally delivered the world from</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.010" end="00:58:53.010" style="s2">darkness in that way right and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">study the out of the topic right</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.010" end="00:58:56.370" style="s2">without thinking that a completely</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:57.870" style="s2">adequate solution is there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.370" end="00:58:59.460" style="s2">probably a lot of partially good</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.870" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">solutions maybe a technology that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.460" end="00:59:03.300" style="s2">totally good technology but it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:05.220" style="s2">market feasibility hasn&#39;t came about yet</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.300" end="00:59:06.900" style="s2">or the way to bring the meme out there</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.220" end="00:59:08.340" style="s2">or parts of the ideas are there but they</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.900" end="00:59:11.130" style="s2">need synthesized whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.340" end="00:59:13.080" style="s2">studies a problem well study what an</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.130" end="00:59:14.760" style="s2">adequate solution would look like gain a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.080" end="00:59:17.220" style="s2">real clear inside of what adequate</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.760" end="00:59:19.850" style="s2">solution looks like in your own area of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.220" end="00:59:22.680" style="s2">what you care to contribute to and as</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.850" end="00:59:24.300" style="s2">things emerge that you feel like you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.680" end="00:59:27.570" style="s2">contribute to as you&#39;re learning about</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.300" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">it contribute to them and continue to</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.570" end="00:59:33.390" style="s2">assess on your own and initiate on your</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">own with of course good input from all</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.390" end="00:59:37.530" style="s2">the places of good input that&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:40.620" style="s2">thing I would say take really deep</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.530" end="00:59:42.150" style="s2">responsibility for the impact that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.620" end="00:59:44.460" style="s2">have in your life while you&#39;re here and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.150" end="00:59:45.870" style="s2">then all of the study all the training</p>

<p begin="00:59:45.870" end="00:59:49.470" style="s2">empower the kind of impact you want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:52.200" style="s2">have make sure that happens</p>
