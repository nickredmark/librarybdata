<p begin="00:00:12.090" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">section of the ninth livestream from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">Dark Horse podcast I am Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">this is dr. Heather huiying to my right</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">and this is Madison in the background</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">and this is Madison walking around the</p>

<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">just ignore the door behind the curtain</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.380" end="00:00:31.560" style="s2">all right shall we go to the questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:33.420" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re gonna spend an hour</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.560" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">answering your super check questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:37.469" style="s2">about half the time will be spent</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">answering questions from the first live</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.469" end="00:00:40.890" style="s2">stream in half for the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:44.789" style="s2">come in during this one without further</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.890" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">ado first question there are no adults</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.789" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">on gov daily brief last night Burke&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">stated the test or 50/50 that&#39;s at this</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">time mark at one 50/50 on Fox News video</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.899" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">available on YouTube the quote is quote</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">these tests are not a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">sensitive or specific so if you have one</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:06.210" style="s2">percent of your population infected and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">you have a test that is only 99 percent</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.210" end="00:01:10.049" style="s2">and specific that means that when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:11.580" style="s2">find a positive fifty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.049" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">time it will be a real positive and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.580" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">fifty percent of the time it won&#39;t be so</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">I believe that this is picking up on I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">mean I guess in most of our live streams</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">being any adults but you specifically</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">said that again today but this you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">I had not seen this we had we still</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t gone to find this on</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:36.770" style="s2">YouTube but this quote does not look</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:39.810" style="s2">wrong it can easily be misinterpreted</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.770" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s it uses the same kind of math</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.810" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">that I walked us through some with some</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">fictional numbers last time in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">eighth live stream and basically the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">idea is if you have let&#39;s just again</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">make up some numbers if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:56.729" style="s2">population of one hundred and one people</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:02:01.310" style="s2">and one percent of the population is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.729" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">infected and there you have a 99%</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.310" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">accuracy rate on the test such that only</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">1% of your tests provide a false</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">positive you test that hundred one</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:13.660" style="s2">people and one of those people who is</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">actually positive will</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.660" end="00:02:17.950" style="s2">come out positive and if the remaining</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:19.810" style="s2">hundred people one of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.950" end="00:02:21.130" style="s2">actually negative or one out of 100 will</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.810" end="00:02:23.350" style="s2">also come out positive so you will end</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.130" end="00:02:25.720" style="s2">up with two positive tests in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.350" end="00:02:27.820" style="s2">population of 101 people one of which</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.720" end="00:02:29.590" style="s2">half in this case is actually positive</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.820" end="00:02:34.420" style="s2">and one of which half in this case is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.590" end="00:02:38.110" style="s2">actually negative so that is true and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.420" end="00:02:39.700" style="s2">changes with the actual background</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.110" end="00:02:40.930" style="s2">infection right as the numbers I went</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.700" end="00:02:45.310" style="s2">through last time as the background</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.930" end="00:02:48.460" style="s2">infection rate climbs the ratio of false</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.310" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">positives to true positives or the ratio</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.460" end="00:02:54.490" style="s2">of true positives false positives</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">changes and as the test in this case you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.490" end="00:02:58.360" style="s2">have a very high specificity of test</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:03:00.070" style="s2">which is higher than most tests seem to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.360" end="00:03:02.380" style="s2">have but the higher the specificity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.070" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">the test the fewer false positives you</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.380" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">get obviously but what people</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.290" style="s2">misunderstand when they hear oh it&#39;s 99%</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:09.340" style="s2">specific there&#39;s only 1% rate of false</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.290" end="00:03:09.820" style="s2">positives means that if you get a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.340" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.820" end="00:03:14.620" style="s2">you only have a 1% chance of it being</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:15.970" style="s2">false that&#39;s not right it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.620" end="00:03:18.010" style="s2">actually what the background rate of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.970" end="00:03:20.170" style="s2">infection is which to know that we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.010" end="00:03:21.520" style="s2">more much more data than we have which</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.170" end="00:03:23.260" style="s2">is the drum we&#39;ve been beating the whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.520" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">time and you can see this much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.260" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">clearly as we discussed at dinner after</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:31.860" style="s2">our last live stream if you use a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:35.290" style="s2">reductio ad absurdum logic if you take</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.860" end="00:03:38.170" style="s2">the example of let&#39;s say a disease that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.290" end="00:03:39.430" style="s2">does not exist cooties for example let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.170" end="00:03:43.000" style="s2">say that we came up with a molecular</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.430" end="00:03:46.390" style="s2">test for cooties now a serology tests</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.000" end="00:03:47.560" style="s2">you mean a serology tests I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.390" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">obviously a molecular test they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.560" end="00:03:50.860" style="s2">calling the antigen test molecular tests</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s say a serology tests</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.860" end="00:03:57.060" style="s2">for cooties cooties does not exist and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">the tests that we generate has a 1%</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.060" end="00:04:02.530" style="s2">false positive rate and we were to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:05.080" style="s2">test every American there are 350</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.530" end="00:04:07.750" style="s2">million Americans about so you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.080" end="00:04:09.370" style="s2">expect 3.5 million people to test</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.750" end="00:04:10.600" style="s2">positive in spite of the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.370" end="00:04:10.989" style="s2">disease we&#39;re testing for it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.600" end="00:04:13.060" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.989" end="00:04:16.060" style="s2">I get the math right I think so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.060" end="00:04:18.669" style="s2">yeah so anyway that tells you why this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.060" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">is a problem that even a very small</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.669" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">false positive rate over a large</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:25.990" style="s2">population will generate a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">actually large number of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.990" end="00:04:32.820" style="s2">in that category wrongly so anyway there</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:38.770" style="s2">it is good</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.820" end="00:04:39.670" style="s2">Wow what happened here we I thought we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.770" end="00:04:41.260" style="s2">look through all these I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.670" end="00:04:44.850" style="s2">there just being a link to a YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.260" end="00:04:49.780" style="s2">channel do I didn&#39;t see this before a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.850" end="00:04:53.200" style="s2">vampire bat one no so Zach if on your</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.780" end="00:04:58.330" style="s2">end if you want to look at the Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.200" end="00:05:00.070" style="s2">15 oh yeah see if there&#39;s anything more</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.330" end="00:05:03.250" style="s2">than just a link there okay next</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.070" end="00:05:05.140" style="s2">question until unless we go back to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.250" end="00:05:07.300" style="s2">one what homework assignment would you</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.140" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">give the audience to take home with if</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.300" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">you were tasked to challenge America to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:15.190" style="s2">begin to become a less tribal and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:18.460" style="s2">pragmatic yeah I mean this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">almost easy right this just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.460" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">matter of generosity of spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:27.790" style="s2">simply putting aside your priors with</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.640" style="s2">respect to whether or not other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.790" end="00:05:33.100" style="s2">are making sense some people don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.640" end="00:05:35.860" style="s2">sense but in general you will find</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.100" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">especially you know if you talk to high</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.860" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">quality people if they believe in things</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:41.290" style="s2">that you are certain or false it may</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:45.370" style="s2">well be that there&#39;s something you need</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.290" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">to learn about it so two things approach</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.370" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">other people with generosity with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:53.170" style="s2">expectation that they may be saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:55.240" style="s2">something that you do not yet understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.170" end="00:05:57.180" style="s2">about their position and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.240" end="00:05:59.920" style="s2">thing would be the formalization of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.180" end="00:06:02.260" style="s2">Steele Manning that when somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.920" end="00:06:04.420" style="s2">expressing a position that you believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.260" end="00:06:06.580" style="s2">is incorrect going through the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.420" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">of figuring out how to say what you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.580" end="00:06:11.620" style="s2">believe their position is so that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:14.920" style="s2">understand and they find your</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.620" end="00:06:17.200" style="s2">presentation sympathetic that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.920" end="00:06:18.550" style="s2">powerful exercise in discovering what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.200" end="00:06:22.030" style="s2">is that&#39;s on the other side that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.550" end="00:06:25.390" style="s2">have yet to see so Steele Manning at</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.030" end="00:06:27.010" style="s2">some level at some point you stop saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.390" end="00:06:28.870" style="s2">that that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing you just</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.839" end="00:08:23.139" style="s2">letter project I don&#39;t know yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:29.889" style="s2">which people are writing letters to each</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.139" end="00:08:31.750" style="s2">other online oh oh great thanks man</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.889" end="00:08:34.839" style="s2">sorry so it&#39;s the Rathbones</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.839" end="00:08:38.289" style="s2">bry it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:40.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just letter wiki that&#39;s it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.289" end="00:08:42.069" style="s2">it letter wiki yeah so the impossible</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.839" end="00:08:43.959" style="s2">cart that they&#39;ve they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.069" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">competition that that closed that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.959" end="00:08:46.360" style="s2">supposed to be judging on you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:47.470" style="s2">people having do</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.360" end="00:08:50.140" style="s2">local conversations would learn either</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.470" end="00:08:53.230" style="s2">in writing yeah I&#39;m so it&#39;s anyone with</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.140" end="00:08:54.910" style="s2">the letter wiki anyone who wants to show</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.230" end="00:08:56.140" style="s2">up with someone that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.910" end="00:08:56.860" style="s2">disagreement about and have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:08:59.589" style="s2">back-and-forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.860" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">in public with respect I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.589" end="00:09:03.820" style="s2">ground rules are basically this is going</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.839" end="00:09:05.170" style="s2">to be readable by others and you must</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.820" end="00:09:07.870" style="s2">you must be respectful</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.170" end="00:09:12.670" style="s2">that&#39;s basically it yeah as a general</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.870" end="00:09:15.910" style="s2">matter shed your prejudices it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.670" end="00:09:18.820" style="s2">inexpensive and you will be overjoyed at</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.910" end="00:09:21.220" style="s2">the dividends it pays there&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.820" end="00:09:23.490" style="s2">little value in walking around making</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:25.899" style="s2">assumptions about who&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.490" end="00:09:35.010" style="s2">you&#39;ll find you&#39;re you&#39;re happier if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.899" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">don&#39;t do it okay hold on a second then</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.010" end="00:09:42.040" style="s2">all right do psychopaths face touch less</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:44.170" style="s2">ie face touching as a social empathic</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.040" end="00:09:46.600" style="s2">emotional telegraphing response versus</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.170" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">grooming oh and the video he included</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.600" end="00:09:50.890" style="s2">was vampire back camera trap video cool</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.750" style="s2">so again the question is about</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.890" end="00:09:56.079" style="s2">Psychopaths and whether they face touch</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.750" end="00:09:58.269" style="s2">less I would imagine there&#39;s data on</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.079" end="00:10:00.579" style="s2">this I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.269" end="00:10:04.329" style="s2">proceeding from in asking that question</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.579" end="00:10:06.279" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that this is the case but</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.329" end="00:10:08.440" style="s2">there does seem to be something about</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.279" end="00:10:11.019" style="s2">face touching and you know we&#39;ve all had</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.440" end="00:10:12.730" style="s2">the experience of somebody does this new</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.019" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">wonder if you have a little something on</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.730" end="00:10:18.130" style="s2">your cheek or something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:20.740" style="s2">obviously there is some sort of empathic</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.130" end="00:10:23.140" style="s2">connection that is expressed sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.740" end="00:10:26.790" style="s2">through touching one&#39;s own face so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.140" end="00:10:29.260" style="s2">yeah but I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t either</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.790" end="00:10:31.510" style="s2">correlation implies causation if it maps</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.260" end="00:10:32.890" style="s2">on to a pre-existing hypothesis confuses</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.510" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">me so this is something that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.890" end="00:10:35.980" style="s2">about in the last livestream</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:37.690" style="s2">that Brett said correlation implies</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.980" end="00:10:39.880" style="s2">causation if it maps onto a pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.690" end="00:10:42.040" style="s2">hypothesis this question says this</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.880" end="00:10:43.649" style="s2">confuses me does Brett mean supports</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.040" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">rather than mathematically implies</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.649" end="00:10:47.640" style="s2">correlation is not mathematical proof of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:10:50.290" style="s2">causality right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.640" end="00:10:52.630" style="s2">right implies doesn&#39;t mean it proves it</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.290" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">but and you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.630" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">details in terms of how strongly implied</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.510" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">causation is you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.360" end="00:11:02.709" style="s2">prediction isn&#39;t a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:05.769" style="s2">implication of causation a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.709" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">surprising prediction that turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.769" end="00:11:11.140" style="s2">be true can very strongly imply</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:13.779" style="s2">causation but in short what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.140" end="00:11:17.890" style="s2">and this is really you know this is in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.779" end="00:11:20.440" style="s2">the philosophy of theoretical work that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.890" end="00:11:23.170" style="s2">when you generate a hypothesis for how</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.440" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">something works you then generate</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.170" end="00:11:27.940" style="s2">predictions from that hypothesis those</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:29.470" style="s2">predictions are often very narrow but</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.940" end="00:11:30.850" style="s2">what is supposed to happen is if those</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.470" end="00:11:33.370" style="s2">predictions turn out to be true</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.850" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">especially if they are surprising in</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.370" end="00:11:40.060" style="s2">some way that cascades back and it says</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:43.089" style="s2">the hypothesis I used to generate that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.060" end="00:11:45.459" style="s2">prediction has some evidence to indicate</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.089" end="00:11:48.610" style="s2">it is right so that hypothesis contains</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.459" end="00:11:50.980" style="s2">a model of how the world functions and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.610" end="00:11:53.350" style="s2">prediction says this is a way we would</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.980" end="00:11:55.779" style="s2">know if that model might be actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.350" end="00:11:57.700" style="s2">functioning and the prediction turns out</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.779" end="00:12:01.209" style="s2">to be true whoa what does the model say</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.700" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">and if I can this risks confusing some</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.209" end="00:12:05.980" style="s2">people but let&#39;s imagine for a second</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:07.690" style="s2">that somebody said you know what I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.980" end="00:12:09.670" style="s2">a crystal ball and it works</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.690" end="00:12:11.199" style="s2">and you&#39;d say Yeah right and they&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.670" end="00:12:13.089" style="s2">I can prove it here I&#39;ll show you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.199" end="00:12:15.430" style="s2">gonna look into my crystal ball and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.089" end="00:12:17.709" style="s2">going to tell you the stock prices of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.430" end="00:12:19.660" style="s2">six stocks for three weeks from today</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.709" end="00:12:22.300" style="s2">all right guys obviously full of crap</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.660" end="00:12:25.089" style="s2">then the stock prices turn out to land</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.300" end="00:12:27.699" style="s2">on those numbers now the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.089" end="00:12:29.230" style="s2">the hell did you do that write something</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.699" end="00:12:30.820" style="s2">about the model this person is using</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.230" end="00:12:33.970" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s insider information we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.820" end="00:12:37.180" style="s2">know but to the extent that something is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.970" end="00:12:38.709" style="s2">predicted from some mechanism when the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.180" end="00:12:41.079" style="s2">prediction has turned out to be true it</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.709" end="00:12:43.890" style="s2">reflects positively on the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.079" end="00:12:47.170" style="s2">ability to see that quadrant and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.890" end="00:12:50.250" style="s2">anyway implies does not mean nails down</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.170" end="00:12:53.410" style="s2">it means implies all right the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.250" end="00:12:58.449" style="s2">the strength of the implication is up</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.410" end="00:13:00.190" style="s2">for debate have you seen this quote</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.449" end="00:13:03.310" style="s2">corona virus has mutated into at least</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.320" end="00:13:22.840" style="s2">peer-reviewed paper which I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.790" end="00:13:27.850" style="s2">actually seen and I think we may talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.840" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">about this a little bit good let me talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.850" end="00:13:31.660" style="s2">about a little bit in the next the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:33.460" style="s2">livestream when we talk perhaps a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.660" end="00:13:35.340" style="s2">bit about names and you know what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.460" end="00:13:38.230" style="s2">means this is it current a virus at all</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.340" end="00:13:39.850" style="s2">but obviously at one level I think we</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.230" end="00:13:47.380" style="s2">can we can take that down now Zach I</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.850" end="00:13:49.330" style="s2">thank you it is we suggested early in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.380" end="00:13:51.160" style="s2">these live streams that this was</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.330" end="00:13:53.020" style="s2">beginning this was going to be mutating</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.160" end="00:13:55.810" style="s2">that there was already evidence that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.020" end="00:13:57.850" style="s2">was mutating what it means for something</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.810" end="00:14:01.030" style="s2">to be a different strain is of course a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.850" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">hard to nail down definition and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.030" end="00:14:08.530" style="s2">there will be disagreement about how big</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:12.190" style="s2">a change mean it takes before immunity</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.530" end="00:14:14.770" style="s2">for instance is no longer valid for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.190" end="00:14:17.860" style="s2">newly mutated strains but it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.770" end="00:14:20.200" style="s2">surprise anyone that given how fast this</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.860" end="00:14:22.330" style="s2">thing is moved and how quickly it has</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.200" end="00:14:25.750" style="s2">spread across all manner of environments</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.330" end="00:14:29.530" style="s2">that it is mutating fast there is</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.750" end="00:14:32.200" style="s2">evidence for instance that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.530" end="00:14:33.970" style="s2">think most of the cases on the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.200" end="00:14:35.260" style="s2">seaboard in the United States are coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.970" end="00:14:36.790" style="s2">out of Europe rather than coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.260" end="00:14:38.650" style="s2">directly function we can already tell</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.790" end="00:14:41.530" style="s2">bat with phylogenetic analysis from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.650" end="00:14:43.390" style="s2">genomes of the various viruses in these</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.530" end="00:14:46.450" style="s2">various places that tells us that this</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.390" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">is changing very fast yeah I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.450" end="00:14:50.710" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen this paper I haven&#39;t looked</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:53.590" style="s2">at it but in some sense it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.710" end="00:14:56.830" style="s2">funny headline it&#39;s undoubtedly mutated</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.590" end="00:14:58.990" style="s2">into innumerable strains that some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.830" end="00:15:01.300" style="s2">these strains then take hold such that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.990" end="00:15:03.400" style="s2">we see a large population that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.300" end="00:15:05.500" style="s2">downstream from some mutation that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.400" end="00:15:07.180" style="s2">can recognize oh this is the strain from</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.500" end="00:15:10.540" style="s2">over there that&#39;s really what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.180" end="00:15:13.750" style="s2">discussed undoubtedly so how many</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.540" end="00:15:15.520" style="s2">strains wow I can&#39;t imagine even how you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.750" end="00:15:18.040" style="s2">would go about calculating it because</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.520" end="00:15:20.680" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be some substantial</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.040" end="00:15:22.180" style="s2">fraction of the number of infections or</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.680" end="00:15:24.440" style="s2">maybe even the number of viral particles</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:26.930" style="s2">out there but most of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.440" end="00:15:30.230" style="s2">mutations will be an almost immediate</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.930" end="00:15:31.790" style="s2">dead end some of them for cause because</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.230" end="00:15:33.589" style="s2">they actually make the virus worse</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.790" end="00:15:36.379" style="s2">some of them for random reasons just</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.589" end="00:15:38.300" style="s2">because most of these infections or at</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.379" end="00:15:41.779" style="s2">least most of these particles will fail</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.300" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">to transmit to anyone else so the very</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.779" end="00:15:46.189" style="s2">fact that something takes hold tells us</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">something interesting and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.189" end="00:15:50.540" style="s2">there&#39;s some hope in it too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:53.139" style="s2">potentially frightening but in general</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.540" end="00:15:57.189" style="s2">as we&#39;ve discussed before these</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.139" end="00:16:00.230" style="s2">infections tend to evolve towards a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.189" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">benign nature some of the evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.230" end="00:16:04.040" style="s2">on the part of the critter being</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:07.639" style="s2">infected and some of it is on the part</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.040" end="00:16:10.870" style="s2">of the pathogen but nonetheless the fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.639" end="00:16:13.790" style="s2">that mutations are spreading isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.870" end="00:16:16.310" style="s2">inherently good or bad doesn&#39;t it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.790" end="00:16:19.939" style="s2">question is are those infections more</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.310" end="00:16:22.370" style="s2">pathogenic are they more contagious are</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.939" end="00:16:23.959" style="s2">they more benign that would tell you</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.370" end="00:16:25.970" style="s2">whether it was a positive or negative</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.959" end="00:16:27.829" style="s2">thing yeah there&#39;s been some suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.970" end="00:16:31.130" style="s2">also for instance that I think it was L</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.829" end="00:16:33.829" style="s2">and s named strains that the L strain</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.130" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">was incredibly variant and much more</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.829" end="00:16:40.040" style="s2">often deadly than the S train much much</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:41.689" style="s2">less so and that we should expect we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.040" end="00:16:46.040" style="s2">should expect to see more of that as we</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.689" end="00:16:47.720" style="s2">get more and more reliable data can you</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.040" end="00:16:50.209" style="s2">both possibly in future talks or now</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.720" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">discuss how game theory and critical</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.209" end="00:16:54.680" style="s2">thinking skills could be integrated into</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.209" style="s2">k-12 education from a frustrated middle</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.680" end="00:16:59.870" style="s2">school teacher trying to change a bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.209" end="00:17:04.339" style="s2">system oh man I feel you yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.870" end="00:17:06.260" style="s2">say games games lots of games games that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.339" end="00:17:08.929" style="s2">make the kids think that the teacher has</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.260" end="00:17:10.850" style="s2">gone crazy and has just declared every</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.929" end="00:17:12.380" style="s2">day a snow day I mean this is really</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.850" end="00:17:14.419" style="s2">what school should look like it should</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.380" end="00:17:16.789" style="s2">be full of games and exercises that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.419" end="00:17:19.250" style="s2">so much fun that kids don&#39;t even realize</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.789" end="00:17:22.510" style="s2">that you&#39;re educating them yeah we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.250" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">to generate those things yeah but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.510" end="00:17:27.500" style="s2">humor you know what he used to say to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:30.169" style="s2">students after you&#39;d made them laugh for</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.500" end="00:17:32.570" style="s2">a long time if you&#39;re laughing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.169" end="00:17:33.310" style="s2">not learning clearly the opposite being</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.570" end="00:17:35.500" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.310" end="00:17:38.710" style="s2">Yeah right you tend to be able to learn</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.500" end="00:17:41.290" style="s2">better when you are relaxed and easy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.710" end="00:17:43.510" style="s2">having a good time being outside your</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.290" end="00:17:46.140" style="s2">outdoor games physical games games that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.510" end="00:17:49.480" style="s2">integrate both your mind with your body</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.140" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">yeah we we we would often actually you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.480" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">know play ultimate with students and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.050" end="00:17:57.850" style="s2">occasionally take a take a timeout to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.030" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">talk about physics right yeah actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.850" end="00:18:04.930" style="s2">you know it&#39;s amazing in the end what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:06.940" style="s2">made of physics no question I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.930" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">wanted to thank you both and Zach for</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.940" end="00:18:09.430" style="s2">the opportunity to hear you both discuss</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.110" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">the matters of the day and your</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.430" end="00:18:11.800" style="s2">evolutionary biology perspectives thank</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:14.140" style="s2">you Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.800" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">are there any studies measuring telomere</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.140" end="00:18:18.340" style="s2">length of human populations depending on</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">ethnicity breeding habits or cultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.340" end="00:18:22.150" style="s2">factors any studies on telomere length</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:25.240" style="s2">of offspring conceived early versus late</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.150" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">in life by the same male question such a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.240" end="00:18:29.500" style="s2">good question I&#39;m not prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:31.690" style="s2">discuss the state of the work on</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.500" end="00:18:33.370" style="s2">different populations yes these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.690" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">have been studied not as systematically</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.370" end="00:18:37.270" style="s2">as I would like maybe some stuff has</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:39.970" style="s2">happened since I was deeply tuned into</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.270" end="00:18:44.380" style="s2">that literature I will say on the point</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.970" end="00:18:48.220" style="s2">about males early and late in life there</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.380" end="00:18:50.500" style="s2">is this one tantalizing result that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.220" end="00:18:52.690" style="s2">remember from back when I originally did</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.500" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">this work that said that the telomere</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.690" end="00:18:58.750" style="s2">lengths in sperm produced by males late</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">in life had longer the it was longer</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.750" end="00:19:02.770" style="s2">telomere length it&#39;s later in life that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">a sperm was produced and this really</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.770" end="00:19:08.460" style="s2">yeah this makes perfect sense in a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:11.830" style="s2">because as we discussed last time</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.460" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">environments in which you have a good</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.830" end="00:19:19.210" style="s2">chance of living longer our ones in</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:21.460" style="s2">which your ability to to basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.210" end="00:19:24.190" style="s2">maintain your tissues longer matter more</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.460" end="00:19:26.860" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna die young as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.190" end="00:19:29.710" style="s2">violence then the fact that your body is</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.860" end="00:19:32.650" style="s2">capable of remaining viable until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.710" end="00:19:35.860" style="s2">80 doesn&#39;t matter very much if your</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.650" end="00:19:37.510" style="s2">environment is purged of violence so</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.860" end="00:19:39.640" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna live longer than having a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.510" end="00:19:42.460" style="s2">body that has those capacities is more</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.640" end="00:19:44.980" style="s2">desirable so how do you how does</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.460" end="00:19:46.420" style="s2">selection detect how safe the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.980" end="00:19:48.340" style="s2">environment is well one</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.420" end="00:19:51.640" style="s2">in which males are producing offspring</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.340" end="00:19:53.650" style="s2">later in life is one in which those</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.640" end="00:19:55.420" style="s2">males have reached later in life and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.650" end="00:19:57.910" style="s2">therefore this would be a very good</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.420" end="00:19:59.820" style="s2">mechanism for adjustment of telomere</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.910" end="00:20:05.290" style="s2">length on a very short time scale</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.820" end="00:20:08.950" style="s2">fascinating this is a bribe to get you</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.290" end="00:20:11.530" style="s2">to vote for Biden Wow well here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.950" end="00:20:13.780" style="s2">thing I have heard that everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.530" end="00:20:17.410" style="s2">their price I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.780" end="00:20:19.900" style="s2">but I know you&#39;re nowhere near mine may</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.410" end="00:20:23.110" style="s2">I suggest a different path or mine could</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.900" end="00:20:25.270" style="s2">you possibly direct the finances that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.110" end="00:20:28.030" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna push our way to get us to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.270" end="00:20:30.460" style="s2">vote for Biden in the direction of Biden</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.030" end="00:20:33.760" style="s2">to get him not to run that&#39;s what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.460" end="00:20:36.130" style="s2">like to see if I&#39;m following the logical</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:37.810" style="s2">conclusion of the damage hypothesis does</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.130" end="00:20:39.130" style="s2">this mean that working out daily for</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.810" end="00:20:41.050" style="s2">example weightlifting would also</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.130" end="00:20:41.830" style="s2">accumulate damage and shorten say their</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.050" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">lifespan</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.830" end="00:20:47.230" style="s2">that&#39;s it another great question yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:49.630" style="s2">really is actually yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.230" end="00:20:51.550" style="s2">there is boy I don&#39;t have access to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.630" end="00:20:52.780" style="s2">here and it&#39;s only kind of vaguely in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.550" end="00:20:56.250" style="s2">head but I feel like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.780" end="00:20:59.170" style="s2">evidence now that pushing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.250" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">beyond certain you know close to your</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.170" end="00:21:04.390" style="s2">limits with regard to what you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">possibly you know you&#39;re I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.390" end="00:21:07.300" style="s2">think if it&#39;s like strength or</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:08.290" style="s2">cardiovascular capacity or what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.300" end="00:21:11.710" style="s2">the things are that have been measured</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.290" end="00:21:13.510" style="s2">at doing that in a regular basis can</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.710" end="00:21:16.330" style="s2">cause at least short-term decreases and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.510" end="00:21:18.840" style="s2">immune response and yes you are</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.330" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">definitely you know what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.840" end="00:21:23.560" style="s2">recovering from a hard work out doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">it&#39;s dealing with all those micro tears</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.560" end="00:21:28.300" style="s2">and your muscles now muscles are one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:31.540" style="s2">the fastest repairing tissues out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.300" end="00:21:33.250" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know about telomere lengths</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.540" end="00:21:36.840" style="s2">in muscles compared to other tissues in</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.250" end="00:21:40.090" style="s2">the body as I mentioned before muscle</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.840" end="00:21:42.760" style="s2">skeletal muscle is multinucleate and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.090" end="00:21:45.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of tissue with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.760" end="00:21:47.230" style="s2">different spectrum of hazards and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.340" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">and the like so the analysis is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.230" end="00:21:50.230" style="s2">hard to compare to something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.810" style="s2">cardiac it&#39;s all it&#39;s at least not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.230" end="00:21:55.060" style="s2">simple prediction but I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.810" end="00:21:57.250" style="s2">not that working out is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.060" end="00:21:59.779" style="s2">going to advance your level of damage in</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.250" end="00:22:01.729" style="s2">fact there is some you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.779" end="00:22:05.450" style="s2">it up to a point but what we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.729" end="00:22:09.019" style="s2">at here is the question is are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:12.590" style="s2">more damage to those tissues than is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.019" end="00:22:14.739" style="s2">justified by the advantages you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.590" end="00:22:17.869" style="s2">strengthening your heart for example</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.739" end="00:22:20.210" style="s2">takes the wear and tear off the heart</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.869" end="00:22:22.940" style="s2">muscle as it pumps blood through a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.210" end="00:22:26.269" style="s2">healthy body so there&#39;s a benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.940" end="00:22:28.219" style="s2">there&#39;s a cost and really you can pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.269" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">well predict that the problem is going</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.219" end="00:22:36.229" style="s2">to emerge and become critical as you</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:38.419" style="s2">push the exercise regime to a limit that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.229" end="00:22:40.909" style="s2">up to a point the exercise is going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.419" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">be positive it&#39;s not to say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.909" end="00:22:45.049" style="s2">no wear and tear and certainly the type</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:49.029" style="s2">of exercise you choose has a lot to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.049" end="00:22:51.649" style="s2">about it so for example running on</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.029" end="00:22:54.019" style="s2">concrete is particularly bad because</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.649" end="00:22:56.839" style="s2">concrete is particularly unforgiving</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.019" end="00:22:58.399" style="s2">running on asphalt is better because as</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.839" end="00:23:00.349" style="s2">much as concrete and asphalt seem</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.399" end="00:23:03.769" style="s2">similar they&#39;re not the asphalt is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.349" end="00:23:06.139" style="s2">more give to it and running on a trails</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.769" end="00:23:07.669" style="s2">is better yet for not just because</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.139" end="00:23:09.349" style="s2">trails are more forgiving but because</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.669" end="00:23:11.029" style="s2">you&#39;re also getting more information</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.349" end="00:23:12.710" style="s2">into your feet and up into your body</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.029" end="00:23:14.719" style="s2">about the kind of terrain you&#39;re on and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.710" end="00:23:17.450" style="s2">what kinds of muscles need to be used</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.719" end="00:23:19.219" style="s2">yeah running on a trail would be better</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.450" end="00:23:21.739" style="s2">until you twist your ankle at which</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.219" end="00:23:23.539" style="s2">point it can be worse but but anyway the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.739" end="00:23:26.719" style="s2">question is are you doing damage and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.539" end="00:23:29.269" style="s2">much and doing some damage in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.719" end="00:23:32.359" style="s2">make yourself physiologically healthier</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.269" end="00:23:35.269" style="s2">is obviously going to be a win but doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.359" end="00:23:39.940" style="s2">lots of damage is certain to be a loss</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.269" end="00:23:39.940" style="s2">okay is that how much time are we at</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.479" end="00:23:46.190" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re gonna try to get through</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.849" end="00:23:48.379" style="s2">these next few questions before skipping</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.190" end="00:23:50.269" style="s2">to you the next live stream okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.379" end="00:23:51.769" style="s2">in a youtube interview I heard Brett say</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.269" end="00:23:53.779" style="s2">that gender differences can be observed</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.769" end="00:23:55.489" style="s2">in trees that is males are Randy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.779" end="00:23:59.809" style="s2">females are coy can you explain more</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.489" end="00:24:03.979" style="s2">well this is primarily a piece of advice</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.809" end="00:24:04.999" style="s2">for people who were trees oh no for one</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.979" end="00:24:07.129" style="s2">thing they don&#39;t freeze</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.999" end="00:24:10.190" style="s2">they never listen but for people who hug</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.129" end="00:24:14.150" style="s2">them you know if you have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.190" end="00:24:15.710" style="s2">sexuality in which you only favor males</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.150" end="00:24:18.590" style="s2">then you want to know which treat no</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.710" end="00:24:21.020" style="s2">this is not the pathway the point is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.590" end="00:24:23.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not trees in particular its</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.020" end="00:24:29.000" style="s2">flowering plants and the point that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.780" end="00:24:32.750" style="s2">made on Rogen was that if you look</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.000" end="00:24:34.580" style="s2">inside of a plant that has both male and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.750" end="00:24:36.260" style="s2">female parts in the same flower and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.580" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">there are lots of plants that do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.260" end="00:24:44.330" style="s2">hermaphrodite they exhibit the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">reaction to effectively casual sex that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.330" end="00:24:50.510" style="s2">we see in humans which is to say the boy</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:52.700" style="s2">parts of the plant are randhir and more</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.510" end="00:24:55.640" style="s2">excited about mating with any old plant</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.700" end="00:24:57.740" style="s2">that&#39;ll have them and the girl parts put</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.640" end="00:25:00.200" style="s2">the boy parts through a test that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.740" end="00:25:03.050" style="s2">involves a long corolla tube where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.200" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">pollen grains have to reach the ovaries</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.050" end="00:25:09.310" style="s2">so it&#39;s basically like a physical</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:13.430" style="s2">manifestation of coyness and my point is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.310" end="00:25:16.040" style="s2">this ain&#39;t no accident this is a law of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.430" end="00:25:18.440" style="s2">nature that has to do with the level of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.040" end="00:25:21.170" style="s2">investment that follows fertilization</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.440" end="00:25:22.970" style="s2">the pollen grain has nothing to lose it</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.170" end="00:25:24.650" style="s2">might as well try to fertilize whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.970" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">it lands on because that&#39;s the one shot</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.650" end="00:25:30.020" style="s2">it&#39;s going to get whereas the ovule in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:32.150" style="s2">the plant has a large investment and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.020" end="00:25:34.280" style="s2">being picky and choosing those pollen</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.150" end="00:25:37.400" style="s2">grains that are from exactly the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.280" end="00:25:38.870" style="s2">species and maybe even some subset of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.400" end="00:25:41.810" style="s2">those that have particularly good</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.870" end="00:25:45.430" style="s2">characteristics is beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.810" end="00:25:47.870" style="s2">so no accident males across the biota</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.430" end="00:25:49.880" style="s2">tend to be more enthusiastic about</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.870" end="00:25:51.680" style="s2">casual sex and females tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.880" end="00:25:54.260" style="s2">coy and it has nothing to do with humans</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.680" end="00:25:56.210" style="s2">okay five more questions before we skip</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.260" end="00:25:58.340" style="s2">skip to the next one but we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.210" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">be quick about these okay does eating a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.340" end="00:26:02.150" style="s2">diet more native to your ancestry</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:03.860" style="s2">provide any benefit to one&#39;s health this</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.150" end="00:26:06.770" style="s2">is a very interesting question we could</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.860" end="00:26:09.050" style="s2">again go on for quite a long time on it</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.770" end="00:26:11.030" style="s2">our dog hasn&#39;t even you know that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.050" end="00:26:12.590" style="s2">our dog groaning in the background who</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.030" end="00:26:14.330" style="s2">does not eat a diet native to her</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.590" end="00:26:18.770" style="s2">ancestry as it tends to be kibble and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:21.500" style="s2">the occasional banana yeah quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.770" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">possibly and this is a book that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.500" end="00:26:25.640" style="s2">100% recommend but I do find</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.770" style="s2">interesting food genes and culture</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.640" end="00:26:29.780" style="s2">eating right for your origins by Gary</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.770" end="00:26:31.340" style="s2">Paul NAB Han so I saw this question that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.780" end="00:26:32.930" style="s2">I actually own this book and no we said</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.340" end="00:26:33.770" style="s2">clear it is so I thought I&#39;d bring it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.930" end="00:26:35.870" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.770" end="00:26:37.880" style="s2">one thing that is certainly true is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.870" end="00:26:40.760" style="s2">there will be no universally best diet</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.880" end="00:26:42.800" style="s2">for all humans because we have different</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.010" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">since we&#39;re doing fine with simpler</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.120" end="00:27:30.020" style="s2">languages why does natural selection not</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:31.610" style="s2">select for simplicity for early humans</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.020" end="00:27:34.940" style="s2">which would have been easier and faster</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.610" end="00:27:36.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem with the premise of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.940" end="00:27:41.240" style="s2">this question languages don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.380" end="00:27:44.360" style="s2">simpler over time and in general we see</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.240" end="00:27:48.430" style="s2">complexity evolve across all systems you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.360" end="00:27:50.780" style="s2">add something I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna try to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.430" end="00:27:54.200" style="s2">rescue the meaning of this question okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.780" end="00:27:55.760" style="s2">good all else being equal it is almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.200" end="00:27:58.190" style="s2">undoubtedly true that language has</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.760" end="00:28:00.200" style="s2">become simpler over time that does not</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.190" end="00:28:01.850" style="s2">mean they become net simpler over time</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.200" end="00:28:03.500" style="s2">in other words if you take the English</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.850" end="00:28:06.200" style="s2">language the number of things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.500" end="00:28:09.230" style="s2">anglish has to describe relative to four</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.200" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">hundred years ago is large and so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.230" end="00:28:12.590" style="s2">complexity has been borrowed from other</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:14.750" style="s2">languages it&#39;s come from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.590" end="00:28:19.190" style="s2">different places but from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.750" end="00:28:21.170" style="s2">view of saying X thing to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.190" end="00:28:24.290" style="s2">that there is a way to make it more</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.170" end="00:28:27.980" style="s2">efficient to get there it is likely to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.290" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">be weakly favored so I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.980" end="00:28:32.900" style="s2">push back we don&#39;t we can&#39;t do this now</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:34.580" style="s2">really but um I would say that not not</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.900" end="00:28:37.040" style="s2">only do we end up with more redundancy</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.580" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">over time like you have rather than one</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.040" end="00:28:41.510" style="s2">word for a concept you end up with you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:43.580" style="s2">know ate mostly overlapping words for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.510" end="00:28:44.840" style="s2">particular concept so that&#39;s that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.580" end="00:28:47.540" style="s2">kind of complexity but more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.840" end="00:28:50.840" style="s2">yet is the amount of metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.540" end="00:28:52.850" style="s2">building so you have you have things</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.840" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">like talk you know Tim higher</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.850" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">temperatures are up</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:57.770" style="s2">why are higher temperatures up so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:29:00.020" style="s2">sort of an obvious place where metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.770" end="00:29:02.150" style="s2">exists in language but when you really</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.020" end="00:29:05.030" style="s2">start looking at the kinds of ways that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.150" end="00:29:06.440" style="s2">we talk in in English which is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.030" end="00:29:08.300" style="s2">the language that we know best</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.440" end="00:29:10.130" style="s2">we have metaphor upon metaphor upon</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.300" end="00:29:11.870" style="s2">metaphor and actually some linguist have</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.130" end="00:29:13.880" style="s2">been able to track some of those so here</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.870" end="00:29:16.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll recommend another book that I find</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.880" end="00:29:17.750" style="s2">a totally extraordinary called the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.040" end="00:29:20.990" style="s2">unfolding of language by a guy named</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.750" end="00:29:22.760" style="s2">guide deutscher it&#39;s a book I&#39;ve and he</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.990" end="00:29:24.260" style="s2">takes an evolutionary approach to both</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.760" end="00:29:27.280" style="s2">the origins of and the spread of</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.260" end="00:29:30.380" style="s2">languages and it&#39;s his point around the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.280" end="00:29:33.380" style="s2">ubiquity and increasing embeddedness of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.380" end="00:29:36.140" style="s2">metaphor that makes me say with you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.380" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">I feel pretty confident that languages</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.140" end="00:29:39.020" style="s2">do not get simpler over time well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">not sure I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.020" end="00:29:44.060" style="s2">disagreeing is what I said was that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:45.770" style="s2">else being equal they will get simpler</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.060" end="00:29:48.470" style="s2">over time but that they&#39;re accumulating</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.770" end="00:29:50.360" style="s2">the ability to say more things and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.470" end="00:29:52.310" style="s2">therefore you will not get a net</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.360" end="00:29:56.990" style="s2">decrease necessarily especially in</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.310" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">modern times okay all right okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.990" end="00:30:00.800" style="s2">if you compared the DNA of a newborn</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.880" end="00:30:02.930" style="s2">baby to the DNA of the same person 90</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.810" end="00:30:16.430" style="s2">have to sort between what we call the</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.430" end="00:30:20.390" style="s2">dead end because they cannot produce a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.200" end="00:30:22.370" style="s2">new person and the germline that is the</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.010" end="00:30:41.540" style="s2">hundred percent but the germline is many</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.140" end="00:30:44.750" style="s2">cells and a male it&#39;s spermatogenic</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.540" end="00:30:49.190" style="s2">tissue and so you can get a mutation</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.750" end="00:30:50.540" style="s2">that will change future generations in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.190" end="00:30:52.530" style="s2">cell within the germline</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.540" end="00:30:56.370" style="s2">things are a little different for</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.580" end="00:33:17.310" style="s2">because that&#39;s dismissive but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.930" end="00:33:19.140" style="s2">lot of terms in there that we would have</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.310" end="00:33:21.660" style="s2">to be careful to make sure we knew</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.140" end="00:33:24.840" style="s2">exactly what we were talking about were</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.660" end="00:33:28.860" style="s2">we to step into the bigger game we would</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.840" end="00:33:31.260" style="s2">very clearly be across an event horizon</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.860" end="00:33:35.520" style="s2">in other words one of the features of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.260" end="00:33:37.380" style="s2">the bigger game would be that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.520" end="00:33:41.990" style="s2">exactly tell where it would lead us and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.380" end="00:33:45.330" style="s2">so in fact a principle that I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.990" end="00:33:48.450" style="s2">governs whether or not we can take a</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.330" end="00:33:52.530" style="s2">particular proposal about a future world</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.450" end="00:33:55.710" style="s2">seriously is does that proposal pretend</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.530" end="00:33:57.660" style="s2">to understand the implications of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:33:59.910" style="s2">is being proposed and if it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.660" end="00:34:02.250" style="s2">specific we know it&#39;s not right because</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.910" end="00:34:04.140" style="s2">the evolutionary force will take</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.250" end="00:34:05.700" style="s2">whatever we deliver it and will modify</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.140" end="00:34:09.810" style="s2">it and so what I want to see is</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.700" end="00:34:12.810" style="s2">proposals that outline what the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.810" end="00:34:15.300" style="s2">objective of the change is and propose a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.810" end="00:34:17.610" style="s2">way to navigate towards that objective</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.300" end="00:34:19.320" style="s2">but are sensitive to the fact that if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.610" end="00:34:21.659" style="s2">try to blueprint the future we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.320" end="00:34:23.840" style="s2">screw it up if we try to navigate to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.659" end="00:34:26.700" style="s2">future it&#39;s readily possible so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.840" end="00:34:29.190" style="s2">take on a navigation metaphor rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.700" end="00:34:31.530" style="s2">than a blueprint metaphor because for</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.190" end="00:34:32.909" style="s2">one thing it&#39;s much more likely to work</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.530" end="00:34:38.460" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.909" end="00:34:40.919" style="s2">SEC what&#39;s the time all right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.460" end="00:34:42.570" style="s2">gonna take 25 minutes to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.919" end="00:34:45.540" style="s2">questions that have come in during this</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.570" end="00:34:48.780" style="s2">live stream in the order that they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.540" end="00:34:51.300" style="s2">come in unless something feels like we</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.780" end="00:34:52.649" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like answering it cooties as</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.300" end="00:34:54.899" style="s2">a concept that is literally false</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.649" end="00:34:56.550" style="s2">metaphorically true question mark might</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.899" end="00:34:57.900" style="s2">have arisen out of a legitimate need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.550" end="00:35:01.770" style="s2">social distance during some past</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.900" end="00:35:03.210" style="s2">academic yes I have wondered about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:04.470" style="s2">and in fact I get a little looking into</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.210" end="00:35:06.330" style="s2">it at one point I&#39;m trying to member</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.470" end="00:35:12.540" style="s2">what the outgrowth was I think it might</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.330" end="00:35:14.730" style="s2">have been lice there was something you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:16.010" style="s2">know there&#39;s obviously very little truth</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.730" end="00:35:18.590" style="s2">to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.010" end="00:35:21.350" style="s2">girls carry lice that boys can catch and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.590" end="00:35:23.780" style="s2">boys can I stick girls can catch I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.350" end="00:35:27.160" style="s2">one could rescue a premise out of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.780" end="00:35:29.660" style="s2">but it does suggest a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.160" end="00:35:33.400" style="s2">but anyway yeah of course cooties could</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.660" end="00:35:40.850" style="s2">be a trainer for some sort of distancing</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.400" end="00:35:43.250" style="s2">absolutely this person is asking if Twi</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.250" end="00:35:47.420" style="s2">get solid info on viruses or he says</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:36:00.770" style="s2">what are the top frequently questioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.960" end="00:36:03.020" style="s2">answers on the subject of kovat 19y -</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.770" end="00:36:07.010" style="s2">the top frequently questioned answers in</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.020" end="00:36:10.310" style="s2">the subject of cove at 19 well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.010" end="00:36:14.660" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.310" end="00:36:17.570" style="s2">means well so what what what is accepted</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.660" end="00:36:18.890" style="s2">as the truth that turns out to have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.570" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">lot of people saying I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.890" end="00:36:23.450" style="s2">right so I would say it from it for</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:25.370" style="s2">instance early on the CFR the case</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.450" end="00:36:29.540" style="s2">fatality rate and now people are talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.370" end="00:36:31.550" style="s2">about the infection fatality rate was</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.540" end="00:36:33.020" style="s2">from a lot of us getting pushed back</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.550" end="00:36:34.700" style="s2">because of the so called denominator</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.020" end="00:36:36.590" style="s2">problem because we simply had no idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.700" end="00:36:38.630" style="s2">still have no idea because the tests</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.590" end="00:36:44.750" style="s2">aren&#39;t being done what the actual</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.630" end="00:36:47.140" style="s2">background infection rate is so how</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.750" end="00:36:50.600" style="s2">things are moving around here</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.140" end="00:36:53.890" style="s2">so what else that we were taught you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.600" end="00:36:57.980" style="s2">know we were told was true by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.890" end="00:37:01.190" style="s2">government&#39;s by the CDC the who you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.980" end="00:37:06.340" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s masked nonsense which seems</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.190" end="00:37:09.590" style="s2">to have been a cover story for</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.340" end="00:37:11.240" style="s2">redirecting medical supplies it may may</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.590" end="00:37:13.340" style="s2">have needed to be redirected towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.240" end="00:37:17.060" style="s2">medical professionals but there&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.340" end="00:37:20.690" style="s2">would say in general the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.060" end="00:37:23.900" style="s2">have such bad data on what actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.690" end="00:37:24.920" style="s2">happens in infections is a reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.900" end="00:37:26.710" style="s2">the fact that we have not been</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.920" end="00:37:29.660" style="s2">systematic about</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.710" end="00:37:30.680" style="s2">identifying a population and testing all</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.660" end="00:37:32.900" style="s2">of the things that we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.680" end="00:37:36.140" style="s2">answer within it so I said in the last</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.900" end="00:37:39.410" style="s2">livestream that I thought military bases</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.140" end="00:37:40.730" style="s2">might provide a place of study these are</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.410" end="00:37:42.319" style="s2">not a population I want to see</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.730" end="00:37:45.049" style="s2">experimented on I would be dead set</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.319" end="00:37:47.539" style="s2">against that but I would like to see us</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.049" end="00:37:50.089" style="s2">take a population that has a describable</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.539" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">limit and figure out what we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.089" end="00:37:54.619" style="s2">about the progression of this disease in</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:58.220" style="s2">that population for example I would like</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.619" end="00:38:00.589" style="s2">for somebody to be able to say what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.220" end="00:38:03.019" style="s2">the effect on the lungs of people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.589" end="00:38:06.440" style="s2">have had a non symptomatic or low</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.019" end="00:38:08.839" style="s2">symptomatic infection and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.440" end="00:38:11.779" style="s2">else be able to bring up a database and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.839" end="00:38:14.390" style="s2">say you know on this military base these</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.779" end="00:38:16.339" style="s2">people have had a low symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.390" end="00:38:19.849" style="s2">infection and are four weeks out from</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.339" end="00:38:22.819" style="s2">their last indication or something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.849" end="00:38:24.500" style="s2">that let us give them x-rays and see</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.819" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">whether they show evidence of lung</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.500" end="00:38:29.150" style="s2">damage then we could know whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:30.680" style="s2">that damage accompanies these low level</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.150" end="00:38:35.029" style="s2">infections or if these low level</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.680" end="00:38:36.680" style="s2">infections are low damage and may</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.029" end="00:38:37.880" style="s2">provide immunity that would also be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.680" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">very interesting finding</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.880" end="00:38:42.170" style="s2">I think we&#39;re some of the only people</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard talking about that though so</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:46.490" style="s2">in terms of frequently questions answers</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:50.299" style="s2">at this point the dog is shaking the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.490" end="00:38:52.130" style="s2">entire studio at this point almost</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.299" end="00:38:53.809" style="s2">everything has been questioned but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.130" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">questions are often just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.809" end="00:38:59.750" style="s2">scattershot because people have begun to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:01.579" style="s2">distrust all sources of information what</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.750" end="00:39:03.769" style="s2">are potential evolutionary components to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.579" end="00:39:05.720" style="s2">lucid dreaming as one who is only lucid</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.769" end="00:39:07.339" style="s2">dreams as far as I can recall it often</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.720" end="00:39:10.849" style="s2">feels more like an affliction than a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.339" end="00:39:12.170" style="s2">benefit um you know act about this a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.849" end="00:39:14.859" style="s2">little bit last livestream is where</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.170" end="00:39:20.390" style="s2">that&#39;s coming from yeah I would just say</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.859" end="00:39:24.529" style="s2">we have cautiously taken a a stance in</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.390" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">favor of hacking ones environment and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.529" end="00:39:29.349" style="s2">hacking oneself</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">lucid dreaming may not be for you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.349" end="00:39:35.569" style="s2">hallucinogenic drugs may not be for you</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">but to the extent that you are looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.569" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">to explore certain things they could</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:43.430" style="s2">potentially provide exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:47.000" style="s2">tool you&#39;re looking for and my point</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.430" end="00:39:48.920" style="s2">would be lucid dreams happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.000" end="00:39:50.359" style="s2">occasionally too many people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.920" end="00:39:53.569" style="s2">trying to have them and then other</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.359" end="00:39:55.970" style="s2">people cultivate the ability to get into</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.569" end="00:39:59.270" style="s2">that lucid state it did occur to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.970" end="00:40:00.950" style="s2">after our last livestream that the most</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.270" end="00:40:03.619" style="s2">important piece of advice that I found</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.950" end="00:40:06.829" style="s2">in the Stanford sleep research on lucid</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.619" end="00:40:09.430" style="s2">dreams was that the way to trigger that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.829" end="00:40:12.230" style="s2">state more regularly involves</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.430" end="00:40:15.020" style="s2">introducing into your normal waking life</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.230" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">the question am I dreaming such that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.020" end="00:40:18.109" style="s2">every time something slightly odd</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:20.930" style="s2">happens you ask yourself that question</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.109" end="00:40:23.059" style="s2">it becomes habitual and then you find</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.930" end="00:40:25.400" style="s2">yourself doing it while dreaming and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.059" end="00:40:27.740" style="s2">dawns on you yes actually in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.400" end="00:40:29.569" style="s2">is a dream at which point the question</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.740" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">is can you remain asleep where does that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.569" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">instantly wake you up so anyway it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:37.579" style="s2">technique and I would advise those who</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:40.099" style="s2">are interested to try it and then once</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.579" end="00:40:42.530" style="s2">you get there ask yourself am I better</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.099" end="00:40:44.420" style="s2">off doing this and I certainly found</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.530" end="00:40:47.180" style="s2">that I was better off for it but that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.420" end="00:40:50.119" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not still doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.180" end="00:40:52.640" style="s2">it had a cost it was exhausting and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.119" end="00:40:54.500" style="s2">got out of it you know maybe I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.640" end="00:40:56.690" style="s2">back to it someday but I got out of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.500" end="00:40:58.670" style="s2">what I got out of it and I&#39;ve moved on</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.690" end="00:41:01.039" style="s2">but it was worth I question seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.670" end="00:41:02.809" style="s2">coming from someone who has no control</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.039" end="00:41:05.990" style="s2">and it&#39;s her default</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.809" end="00:41:07.369" style="s2">I think her default state is in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.990" end="00:41:09.470" style="s2">opposite direction for most people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.369" end="00:41:11.210" style="s2">default state so being stuck in lucid</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.470" end="00:41:13.670" style="s2">dreaming territory would indeed</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.210" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">I feel like an affliction I think yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.670" end="00:41:19.010" style="s2">I would say final thing on this is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:22.539" style="s2">most interesting thing about the state</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.010" end="00:41:25.220" style="s2">was the fact that it was not a state of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.539" end="00:41:27.410" style="s2">total control not even remotely</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.220" end="00:41:31.130" style="s2">it was a state in which I had control</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.410" end="00:41:33.710" style="s2">over what I did in dreams but I had</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.130" end="00:41:37.220" style="s2">almost no control over what the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.710" end="00:41:40.609" style="s2">around me did and I found that division</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.220" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">to be very evolutionarily significant in</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.609" end="00:41:45.859" style="s2">other words it said it&#39;s like life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:47.630" style="s2">a little bit like life is about right</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.859" end="00:41:49.700" style="s2">and so anyway it&#39;s certainly worth</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.630" end="00:41:51.260" style="s2">seeing whether that dividing line is in</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.700" end="00:41:53.480" style="s2">the same place for you as it was for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.260" end="00:41:58.130" style="s2">and if so what those implications</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.480" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">be for the utility of dreams good so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.130" end="00:42:02.540" style="s2">next question I think is one that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:04.250" style="s2">just answered from the last live stream</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.540" end="00:42:06.080" style="s2">about languages and getting</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.250" end="00:42:08.330" style="s2">morphologically similar simpler over</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.080" end="00:42:10.910" style="s2">time so we&#39;re not going to replay that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.330" end="00:42:12.440" style="s2">conversation what can evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.910" end="00:42:14.090" style="s2">biology teach us about fixing our</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.440" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">political systems specifically the two</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.090" end="00:42:22.700" style="s2">party monopolies least of two turds</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:24.500" style="s2">keeps us in hurts that&#39;s good I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.700" end="00:42:27.650" style="s2">say first of all it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.500" end="00:42:30.530" style="s2">evolutionary biology per se but game</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.650" end="00:42:33.320" style="s2">theory I believe certainly tells us that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.530" end="00:42:35.930" style="s2">first-past-the-post voting is liable to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.320" end="00:42:38.840" style="s2">default into two incoherent parties and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.930" end="00:42:42.200" style="s2">our parties are beyond incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.840" end="00:42:46.780" style="s2">they&#39;re also deeply corrupt but there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.200" end="00:42:50.950" style="s2">a lesson in building a system in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.780" end="00:42:53.420" style="s2">corruption is avoided based on</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.950" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">structural protections against its</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.420" end="00:42:59.390" style="s2">evolution it&#39;s not a simple problem but</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:43:04.030" style="s2">it is a tractable problem and anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.390" end="00:43:07.850" style="s2">think any effort at a better society</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.030" end="00:43:09.890" style="s2">will its success or failure depends</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.850" end="00:43:12.020" style="s2">critically on whether it has nailed the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.890" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">question of capture and how to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.020" end="00:43:19.160" style="s2">it if you were in charge of the kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:24.109" style="s2">response for the US what would you do</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.160" end="00:43:26.180" style="s2">right now I think I spelled it out a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.109" end="00:43:28.100" style="s2">little bit in my description of what if</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.180" end="00:43:33.010" style="s2">Trump did it we should all get behind</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.100" end="00:43:36.680" style="s2">which is to say make happen and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.010" end="00:43:39.230" style="s2">distribute and get tested for both types</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.680" end="00:43:40.850" style="s2">of tests antigen and antibody testing as</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.230" end="00:43:43.369" style="s2">widely as possible as quickly as</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.410" end="00:43:53.300" style="s2">explain to the public what various</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.340" end="00:43:55.880" style="s2">results will mean in terms of release of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.300" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">lock down in stages and how soon it</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.880" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">might be able to happen you know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">kinds of base infection rates suggest</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:04.140" style="s2">that we might be moving towards herd</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.280" end="00:44:06.450" style="s2">immunity if we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.140" end="00:44:08.040" style="s2">you know a significant number of people</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.450" end="00:44:10.020" style="s2">who&#39;ve already been infected</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.040" end="00:44:15.090" style="s2">can we start doing track and trace on</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.020" end="00:44:18.300" style="s2">people who develop new new cases this</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.090" end="00:44:20.940" style="s2">you know information that&#39;s based on a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.300" end="00:44:23.130" style="s2">plan from our government that is based</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.940" end="00:44:27.210" style="s2">on actual information is what we need</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.130" end="00:44:30.660" style="s2">and I have seen basically nothing no</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.210" end="00:44:33.540" style="s2">evidence that the people at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.660" end="00:44:37.590" style="s2">levels of government are doing much to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.540" end="00:44:40.790" style="s2">get testing widespread quickly and for</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.590" end="00:44:44.550" style="s2">my part I would identify populations</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.790" end="00:44:47.990" style="s2">that could be studied with respect to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.550" end="00:44:50.760" style="s2">couple different questions a what is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.990" end="00:44:52.920" style="s2">what are the basic facts about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.760" end="00:44:53.250" style="s2">infection and the damage that comes with</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.920" end="00:44:57.090" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.250" end="00:45:01.170" style="s2">and what is the consequence of various</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.090" end="00:45:02.880" style="s2">different lockdown readings so among the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.170" end="00:45:06.330" style="s2">many things you could study in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.880" end="00:45:09.180" style="s2">military base context would be you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.330" end="00:45:13.080" style="s2">test the effect of various relaxation of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.180" end="00:45:15.780" style="s2">the lockdown protocol in particular what</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.080" end="00:45:17.490" style="s2">happens if you free people to go into</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.780" end="00:45:19.350" style="s2">the outdoor spaces maybe you even</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.490" end="00:45:23.460" style="s2">encourage them to go to the outdoor</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.350" end="00:45:26.610" style="s2">spaces maybe you have provisions for how</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.460" end="00:45:28.230" style="s2">you would be expected to do it but if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.610" end="00:45:31.020" style="s2">is true that these things need to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.230" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">locked down then certainly we should</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.020" end="00:45:35.010" style="s2">find that out before we unlock them down</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:37.050" style="s2">and if it is true that people in</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.010" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">lockdown can be freed to do those</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.050" end="00:45:44.120" style="s2">activities and it won&#39;t cause a jump in</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:47.340" style="s2">the infection rate and it will cause a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.120" end="00:45:49.050" style="s2">jump in psychological health based on</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.340" end="00:45:51.630" style="s2">not being you know cooped up in your</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.050" end="00:45:54.180" style="s2">house then we should know that so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.630" end="00:45:56.790" style="s2">would just say look there&#39;s no mystery</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.180" end="00:45:58.950" style="s2">here this is a set of phenomena it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.790" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">study abou in the same way every other</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.950" end="00:46:02.940" style="s2">set of phenomena is study about the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:04.620" style="s2">you would do this properly is you would</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.940" end="00:46:06.510" style="s2">identify a population that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.620" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">representative enough and then you would</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.510" end="00:46:10.740" style="s2">stay to start taking really good</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:12.990" style="s2">thorough data so you could ask any</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.740" end="00:46:15.060" style="s2">relevant question quickly and get an</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.990" end="00:46:16.320" style="s2">answer and then we could stop doing what</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.060" end="00:46:18.220" style="s2">we&#39;re doing now which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.320" end="00:46:22.460" style="s2">responsible</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.220" end="00:46:24.950" style="s2">blindly based on our intuition it could</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.460" end="00:46:27.020" style="s2">just be done much better with data I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.950" end="00:46:30.410" style="s2">will say I&#39;m not sure this is directly</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.020" end="00:46:34.070" style="s2">apropos but as we&#39;ve we&#39;ve begun talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.410" end="00:46:36.740" style="s2">at dinner about my and our growing</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.070" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">concerns about sort of the ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.740" end="00:46:41.540" style="s2">maintenance to people&#39;s bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:43.730" style="s2">psyches that aren&#39;t happening during</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.540" end="00:46:46.520" style="s2">lockdown that you know medical offices</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.730" end="00:46:48.170" style="s2">are closed dental offices are closed I</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.520" end="00:46:49.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know about therapists actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.170" end="00:46:52.460" style="s2">presumably some of that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.720" end="00:46:54.950" style="s2">remotely yeah but you know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.460" end="00:46:56.510" style="s2">a lot about about movement and being</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.950" end="00:46:59.720" style="s2">outside and such but there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.510" end="00:47:02.600" style="s2">other things that people need you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.720" end="00:47:04.700" style="s2">if this were an excuse me if this were</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.600" end="00:47:07.430" style="s2">happening two years ago and I was still</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.700" end="00:47:08.420" style="s2">I personally was still in the physical</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.920" end="00:47:26.690" style="s2">helped me get back together I would be</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.690" end="00:47:32.330" style="s2">rather you know at this point it having</p>

<p begin="00:47:32.330" end="00:47:36.890" style="s2">I&#39;d been able to see anyone and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.940" end="00:47:39.320" style="s2">we are lucky that none of us is in such</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.890" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">a state at this point we&#39;re all able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.320" end="00:47:42.650" style="s2">be healthy and to maintain health</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">through the activities that we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.650" end="00:47:47.060" style="s2">engage in in our home and near our home</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:49.610" style="s2">but there have to be many people and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.060" end="00:47:51.770" style="s2">has to be a higher risk the older they</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.610" end="00:47:55.810" style="s2">are who actually need sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.770" end="00:47:59.060" style="s2">maintenance work at some level and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.810" end="00:48:01.160" style="s2">talking about the lockdown as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.060" end="00:48:02.270" style="s2">binary has the same problem is talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.160" end="00:48:04.040" style="s2">about you know the effect of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.270" end="00:48:07.610" style="s2">diseases of its binary it&#39;s not you die</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.040" end="00:48:09.790" style="s2">or you&#39;re fine and it&#39;s not you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.610" end="00:48:11.660" style="s2">leave your house or everything is open</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.790" end="00:48:13.870" style="s2">you know it&#39;s probably going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.660" end="00:48:17.540" style="s2">while before nightclubs are deemed safe</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.870" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">but going to your doctor or your massage</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.540" end="00:48:23.060" style="s2">therapist or what you know any any</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.240" end="00:48:25.670" style="s2">number of types of things in which</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.060" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">people can be safe but do and do end up</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.670" end="00:48:31.970" style="s2">in close contact should be possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:33.319" style="s2">much sooner yeah it occurs to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.970" end="00:48:38.299" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t the right concept but we</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.319" end="00:48:40.910" style="s2">need something like Maslow&#39;s timeline of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.299" end="00:48:42.710" style="s2">need there are things which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.910" end="00:48:44.510" style="s2">need on the scale of a few weeks you</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.710" end="00:48:47.559" style="s2">might mean on the scale of a few months</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.510" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">this is reference to Maslow 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.559" end="00:48:53.150" style="s2">psychologist ish I think hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:56.119" style="s2">needs is definitely a pyramid yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.150" end="00:48:57.769" style="s2">and anyway the point is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.119" end="00:49:01.849" style="s2">something is or isn&#39;t essential you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.769" end="00:49:03.079" style="s2">is buying pants essential I was on</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.849" end="00:49:05.089" style="s2">whether or not you&#39;ve got pants right</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.079" end="00:49:07.099" style="s2">exactly at the point that all your pants</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.089" end="00:49:09.319" style="s2">are no longer functional it becomes kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.099" end="00:49:12.710" style="s2">of important well in this this is too</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.319" end="00:49:16.819" style="s2">too silly but we&#39;ve got a cat that eats</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.710" end="00:49:19.670" style="s2">socks and you and Zachary have both lost</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.819" end="00:49:22.339" style="s2">a fair number of socks to this cat and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.670" end="00:49:23.720" style="s2">went to get socks for Zachary to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.339" end="00:49:24.349" style="s2">site that I usually get socks from when</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.720" end="00:49:26.359" style="s2">they&#39;re closed</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.349" end="00:49:29.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no they&#39;re just they&#39;re closed</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.359" end="00:49:31.250" style="s2">for business for the for the foreseeable</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.240" end="00:49:33.170" style="s2">future yes except that all the dog</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.250" end="00:49:35.890" style="s2">people in our audience are thinking the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.170" end="00:49:38.269" style="s2">solution to this problem is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.890" end="00:49:39.470" style="s2">we&#39;ll say we have our dog in the room we</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.269" end="00:49:41.630" style="s2">don&#39;t have any of the cats in the room</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.470" end="00:49:43.700" style="s2">here our dog does not make sucks though</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.630" end="00:49:45.410" style="s2">so this this is a problem yeah she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.700" end="00:49:48.170" style="s2">looking for good work and that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.410" end="00:49:49.819" style="s2">heard to her yet anyway there is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.170" end="00:49:53.359" style="s2">a shortage of socks in our environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.819" end="00:49:54.789" style="s2">and and fewer abilities fewer routes to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.359" end="00:49:58.869" style="s2">getting them there I&#39;m actually missing</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.789" end="00:50:02.509" style="s2">more left than rights which is weird</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.869" end="00:50:06.589" style="s2">do you do you believe that infinity goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.509" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">macro and micro I&#39;d never thought about</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.589" end="00:50:12.170" style="s2">this before I don&#39;t think so I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:16.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a hard floor zero zero</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.170" end="00:50:20.599" style="s2">and nothingness are real and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.210" end="00:50:21.980" style="s2">infinity can go out and up and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.599" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">I&#39;ve always thought the zero was the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.980" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">loneliest number I realized I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:28.970" style="s2">minority on that one but anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:31.579" style="s2">zero does seem to be a hard floor yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.970" end="00:50:33.619" style="s2">you could go fractional infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.579" end="00:50:36.890" style="s2">presumably but I think yeah I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.619" end="00:50:39.259" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna avoid this question as a non</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.259" end="00:50:42.440" style="s2">myself in trouble yeah well your</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.420" end="00:50:46.040" style="s2">brother&#39;s a mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.440" end="00:50:47.780" style="s2">mine isn&#39;t so that&#39;s right now in</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.040" end="00:50:50.300" style="s2">biological versus civilization</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.780" end="00:50:52.190" style="s2">timeframes do viral outbreaks discourage</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.300" end="00:50:57.099" style="s2">rule-breaking or rebellious behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.190" end="00:50:57.099" style="s2">that good long-term human culture I</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.369" end="00:51:04.990" style="s2">can&#39;t quite follow there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.410" end="00:51:07.670" style="s2">of it&#39;s a lot going on in this question</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.990" end="00:51:09.349" style="s2">if we just take the middle part do viral</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.670" end="00:51:15.230" style="s2">outbreaks discourage rule-breaking or</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.349" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">rebellious behavior it&#39;s not clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.230" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">why they would it&#39;s also not clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:27.079" style="s2">that our relationship with viruses is</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:28.220" style="s2">not largely I want to be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.079" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">about this it&#39;s not like we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.220" end="00:51:32.750" style="s2">have had any viruses but the number of</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:35.089" style="s2">viruses that a person encounters in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.750" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">lifetime I think has radically changed</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.089" end="00:51:38.930" style="s2">as a result of the fact that all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:41.540" style="s2">these things that would circulate in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.930" end="00:51:43.970" style="s2">small population are now going global</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.540" end="00:51:46.540" style="s2">and so you know there are dozens of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.970" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">viruses circulating every winter and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.540" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">things like this so anyway it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:52.430" style="s2">clear to me what the historical</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:53.510" style="s2">circumstance would have been and what</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.510" end="00:51:57.230" style="s2">therefore with personality</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.790" end="00:51:58.819" style="s2">characteristics like the ones you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.230" end="00:52:01.910" style="s2">talking about interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.819" end="00:52:03.589" style="s2">though mm-hmm how do we approach the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.910" end="00:52:05.630" style="s2">insidiousness and addictiveness of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.589" end="00:52:07.609" style="s2">sugar in our food supply food a holic</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.630" end="00:52:09.470" style="s2">synonymous what&#39;s a good first step for</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.609" end="00:52:12.859" style="s2">better health for the individual and for</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.470" end="00:52:16.760" style="s2">society it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.859" end="00:52:18.890" style="s2">sugar does seem to be one of the hidden</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.760" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">pieces of the puzzle that until pretty</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.890" end="00:52:25.819" style="s2">recently some combination of legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.640" end="00:52:28.700" style="s2">confusion and you know big sugar for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.819" end="00:52:34.099" style="s2">sugar Lobby is managed to keep obscure</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.700" end="00:52:37.550" style="s2">from many people you know I know salt</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.099" end="00:52:39.859" style="s2">and fat we are not medical doctors salt</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.550" end="00:52:41.720" style="s2">and fat do not seem to be certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.859" end="00:52:44.690" style="s2">fat and even cell does not seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.720" end="00:52:46.670" style="s2">the enemy of human health that that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.690" end="00:52:50.270" style="s2">were told it was we&#39;re not doctors but</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.670" end="00:52:51.670" style="s2">we are hungry and and obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.270" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different kinds of fat</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.670" end="00:52:56.290" style="s2">so there are plenty of fats that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:59.710" style="s2">plenty bad for you</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.290" end="00:53:03.070" style="s2">but plant fats and animal fats yes even</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.710" end="00:53:04.900" style="s2">animal fats are far better from you then</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.070" end="00:53:10.570" style="s2">again fats that were synthesized in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.900" end="00:53:13.960" style="s2">lab on average so sugar is has been in</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.570" end="00:53:16.570" style="s2">short supply in our diet in the past as</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.960" end="00:53:21.460" style="s2">salt has eyes fat has which explains our</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.570" end="00:53:24.040" style="s2">cravings but the ability to turn beets</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.460" end="00:53:27.760" style="s2">and sugar cane into crystalline form and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.040" end="00:53:30.250" style="s2">bake them into deliciousness is quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.760" end="00:53:34.300" style="s2">new in you know why it&#39;s a few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.250" end="00:53:35.740" style="s2">years old really right so well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.300" end="00:53:38.170" style="s2">good first step and I think at some</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.740" end="00:53:39.700" style="s2">level the last five or ten years we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.170" end="00:53:43.120" style="s2">been beginning to take this step that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.700" end="00:53:45.940" style="s2">increasingly people are aware of of how</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.120" end="00:53:47.380" style="s2">toxic sugar actually is but I don&#39;t off</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.940" end="00:53:50.440" style="s2">the top of my head have a better answer</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.380" end="00:53:52.440" style="s2">than that yeah I would say I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.440" end="00:53:55.780" style="s2">all sugars are equal they&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.440" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">too easily accessed and we are very</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.780" end="00:54:01.930" style="s2">tuned into their presence because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:04.750" style="s2">their obvious high caloric value yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.930" end="00:54:08.230" style="s2">fructose the sugar and maple syrup far</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.750" end="00:54:11.170" style="s2">better for you than sucrose derived from</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.230" end="00:54:13.750" style="s2">beets and cane sugar but the basic</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.170" end="00:54:17.860" style="s2">advice would be you&#39;re not gonna regret</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.750" end="00:54:20.290" style="s2">weaning yourself off of especially those</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.290" end="00:54:25.240" style="s2">stuff yeah and you know we say that as</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.810" end="00:54:27.940" style="s2">people who eat sugar it&#39;s not that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.240" end="00:54:30.850" style="s2">are when you&#39;re pure in this regard okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.940" end="00:54:32.050" style="s2">next question five minutes more okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.850" end="00:54:34.530" style="s2">we&#39;ll get through as many of these as we</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.050" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">can do you know if there are any studies</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.530" end="00:54:37.120" style="s2">regarding the mental health cost of the</p>

<p begin="00:54:37.120" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">I&#39;m sure the effect is negative but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.800" end="00:54:41.380" style="s2">hard to quantify we should think about</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:43.390" style="s2">it when talking about how long the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.380" end="00:54:46.150" style="s2">shutdown will last yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.390" end="00:54:48.510" style="s2">we&#39;ve we have been talking about it I am</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.150" end="00:54:51.570" style="s2">not aware of any studies if anyone is</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.510" end="00:54:54.610" style="s2">maybe you know either</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.610" end="00:55:00.460" style="s2">which you can find on our webpages but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.760" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">don&#39;t think any such work has been done</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.460" end="00:55:07.099" style="s2">yet I read something</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:09.170" style="s2">I&#39;m not prepared to put any weight on it</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.099" end="00:55:12.049" style="s2">but I would say I wouldn&#39;t leap to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.170" end="00:55:14.180" style="s2">conclusion that certainly it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.049" end="00:55:15.650" style="s2">be negative for some people and over the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.180" end="00:55:17.690" style="s2">longer it lasts probably the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.650" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">negative for the more for more people</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.690" end="00:55:25.130" style="s2">but there some people are finding a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:29.180" style="s2">great deal of purpose in being freed</p>

<p begin="00:55:46.369" end="00:55:50.420" style="s2">if it has given you something to think</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.990" end="00:55:53.089" style="s2">about and some way to re-engineer your</p>

<p begin="00:55:53.089" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">it&#39;s this is this has been costly if</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.400" end="00:55:58.839" style="s2">there&#39;s some upside to it that&#39;s all to</p>

<p begin="00:56:07.339" end="00:56:12.410" style="s2">we break that gate Cheers</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.009" end="00:56:14.930" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m a fan of this idea I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.410" end="00:56:16.970" style="s2">certainly encountered the gated</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.930" end="00:56:20.710" style="s2">institutional narrative more times than</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.970" end="00:56:22.910" style="s2">I can count and you know is that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.710" end="00:56:27.109" style="s2">precise description of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.910" end="00:56:29.450" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s a it&#39;s a metaphor but it</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.109" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">stands for something real how the Djinn</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.450" end="00:56:35.690" style="s2">happens how it functions is up for</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:38.059" style="s2">discussion but let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.690" end="00:56:39.619" style="s2">those who have encountered it have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.059" end="00:56:42.500" style="s2">pretty good idea what Eric is talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.619" end="00:56:44.750" style="s2">about and if you haven&#39;t encountered it</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.500" end="00:56:46.339" style="s2">then you ought to listen to those of us</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.750" end="00:56:49.099" style="s2">who have and say wow isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.339" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">interesting that people who you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.099" end="00:56:55.940" style="s2">don&#39;t seem crazy are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:58.339" style="s2">encounters with this you know glass like</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.940" end="00:57:00.109" style="s2">barrier that prevents things that need</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.339" end="00:57:02.299" style="s2">to happen from happening prevents things</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.109" end="00:57:05.569" style="s2">that need to be said from being voiced</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.299" end="00:57:08.269" style="s2">in certain places it&#39;s real I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.569" end="00:57:12.230" style="s2">how it came to be but it&#39;s definitely an</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.269" end="00:57:14.839" style="s2">obstacle to progress two more questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.230" end="00:57:17.029" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll sign off is this the end</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.839" end="00:57:17.900" style="s2">of the Industrial Revolution has nobody</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.029" end="00:57:19.700" style="s2">noticed that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.900" end="00:57:21.349" style="s2">system has failed it is starting to look</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.700" end="00:57:24.230" style="s2">like billions of people that rely on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.349" end="00:57:28.069" style="s2">system will die many of us have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.230" end="00:57:31.640" style="s2">that the system has failed that said it</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.069" end="00:57:34.010" style="s2">can get far worse and I know many of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.640" end="00:57:36.289" style="s2">people who understand that the system</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.010" end="00:57:38.809" style="s2">has failed I have a belief that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.289" end="00:57:41.089" style="s2">basically okay collapse is coming let it</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.809" end="00:57:44.809" style="s2">happen and then we&#39;ll rebuild no you</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.089" end="00:57:47.990" style="s2">won&#39;t we have to retool without collapse</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.809" end="00:57:49.549" style="s2">occurring and that is a difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.990" end="00:57:51.529" style="s2">frightening prospect it&#39;s the first time</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.549" end="00:57:54.589" style="s2">this has happened to humanity that were</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.529" end="00:57:57.230" style="s2">actually utterly dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.589" end="00:57:59.180" style="s2">fragility of the system not having it</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.230" end="00:58:00.740" style="s2">grind to a halt because we are all</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.180" end="00:58:04.609" style="s2">dependent on it even those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.740" end="00:58:06.410" style="s2">understand its brokenness okay next one</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.609" end="00:58:08.119" style="s2">is not a question but just that you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.410" end="00:58:11.630" style="s2">been sent onto your website address</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.119" end="00:58:12.920" style="s2">paper on exercise and aging so final</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.630" end="00:58:14.450" style="s2">question what do you guys think about</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.920" end="00:58:16.940" style="s2">states like Georgia reopening</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.450" end="00:58:19.430" style="s2">non-essential businesses on the 27th I</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.940" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">assume that means the 27th of April here</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.430" end="00:58:25.220" style="s2">in Oregon there&#39;s been talk about end of</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">May as a as a reopening date I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.220" end="00:58:29.660" style="s2">heard that it really depends on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:34.250" style="s2">going on in those states to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.660" end="00:58:36.589" style="s2">it seems early on the other hand some</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.250" end="00:58:38.450" style="s2">states are far less affected on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.589" end="00:58:42.380" style="s2">other hand how is it that you&#39;re then</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.450" end="00:58:45.380" style="s2">going to patrol the borders I would say</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.380" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">in addition I am very concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.380" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">what it is that will trigger the various</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:54.140" style="s2">races to the bottom between the states</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:56.930" style="s2">between nations between people and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.140" end="00:58:58.670" style="s2">say let&#39;s give Georgia the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.930" end="00:59:01.010" style="s2">the doubt here let&#39;s say Georgia knows</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.670" end="00:59:03.829" style="s2">something about its own epidemiology</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.010" end="00:59:07.190" style="s2">that actually justifies it going off</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.829" end="00:59:09.170" style="s2">lockdown but then other states start</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.190" end="00:59:11.690" style="s2">looking at Georgians behaving normally</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.170" end="00:59:14.210" style="s2">and begin to feel that Georgians are</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.690" end="00:59:16.190" style="s2">pulling away and that they need to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.210" end="00:59:17.660" style="s2">back into the race</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.190" end="00:59:20.750" style="s2">the race to the bottom gets triggered</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.660" end="00:59:23.000" style="s2">all too easily and lots of places can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.750" end="00:59:25.190" style="s2">afford to go off lockdown so as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.000" end="00:59:26.900" style="s2">been saying now for weeks we need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.190" end="00:59:29.270" style="s2">think about the game theory and we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.900" end="00:59:30.570" style="s2">to figure out at the moment the world is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.270" end="00:59:33.030" style="s2">on pause</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.570" end="00:59:34.830" style="s2">the point you start taking parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.030" end="00:59:38.460" style="s2">world off pause a whole different thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.830" end="00:59:42.530" style="s2">unfolds and the importance of what will</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.460" end="00:59:45.900" style="s2">unfold is would be difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.530" end="00:59:49.170" style="s2">overstate it&#39;s really potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.900" end="00:59:52.980" style="s2">major disaster epidemiologically and in</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.170" end="00:59:55.260" style="s2">other ways as well so let&#39;s be really</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.980" end="00:59:58.860" style="s2">careful not to rush to reopen things and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.260" end="01:00:01.650" style="s2">as I said earlier let&#39;s study ways that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.860" end="01:00:06.060" style="s2">we could relax the lockdown without</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.650" end="01:00:08.130" style="s2">triggering such a cascade so not a</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.060" end="01:00:10.860" style="s2">question but one last thing someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.130" end="01:00:12.450" style="s2">writes in that he listens to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.860" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">streaming and that we should be asking</p>
