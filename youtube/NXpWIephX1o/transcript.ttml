<p begin="00:00:12.799" end="00:00:17.520" style="s2">because i think the problem of truth the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:20.640" style="s2">collapse of institutional authority</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.520" end="00:00:22.480" style="s2">and how we come to truth together is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.640" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">right at the core of all of the other</p>

<p begin="00:01:11.840" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">of his lectures and thought well i might</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">as well get an interview with him while</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.799" style="s2">i&#39;m out there i&#39;m a journalist so i</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">applied got an interview you came in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.799" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">from where</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">i came in from london i ended up making</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">the first documentary about him i</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:26.799" style="s2">got the interview and then thought well</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">no one&#39;s actually kind of done a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">documentary about his thoughts i put</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">that together</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">and then just after i put that out</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">literally about three or four days after</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:37.759" style="s2">i put that out</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">he went on channel 4 news and had that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.759" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">very famous viral interview with kathy</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:42.399" style="s2">newman</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:44.079" style="s2">that maybe some of you might have seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">and i used to work with kathy newman</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.079" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">so i was actually in the office in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">channel 4 news</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:52.720" style="s2">probably about two weeks maybe a month</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">before that interview went out so i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.720" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">still freelancing there while i was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">while i was doing documentaries and so i</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">was like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">really weird position to be in i put out</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">the first documentary about jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">peterson</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">and then he kind of rockets to fame on</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">the news program that i used to work for</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">so i was like what am i supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">with this and the irony was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">what i talked to him about was</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">this kind of jungian psychological idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">coincidences that have a deeper meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">so i was like this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">kind of a weird synchronicity what am i</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">so for a while i started trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">negotiate behind the scenes between</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">kathy newman and jordan about</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">maybe doing another interview because i</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you remember after the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">interview there&#39;s a lot of controversy</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">jordan felt that um the channel four was</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">sort of spinning that kathy was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">victim and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">there was a lot of stuff going on on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">twitter and it was kind of like watching</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">two people that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">knew and knew were good people and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">bring them back together to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">jordan was really keen and kathy wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">so i was like okay that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">so in the end i put together this film</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:00.879" style="s2">called glitch in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">looking at the kathy newman interview</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">and why it had gone viral and what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">about the media sort of the balance</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:08.159" style="s2">between the mainstream media the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">what it said about us as a culture and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">it became so jordan put it onto his</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">channel it&#39;s now got about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">two and a half million views on his</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">channel in that film i</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">i put in a few criticisms of channel</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">four news and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">a few criticisms of kathy newman so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">knew when i put that out that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">i was making it much more difficult like</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">to go back into the newsroom and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">i kind of knew that i was kind of ending</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">my career with in the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">by doing it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">but i just had this sense that there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">something more exciting kind of on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">and rebel wisdom pretty much started</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">through that that piece</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">but this is why the the topic of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">is quite close to my heart because i</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">feel that there&#39;s some skin in the game</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">then like i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">put all of my chips on jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">and the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">and so when that that first glitch in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">the matrix film</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">was out or when i was putting that out</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">literally in the last week or so that i</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">was working on it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">i saw this thing called the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">dark web on the dave rubin show and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">thought that&#39;s a quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">interesting concept i put a few lines in</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">the film and then put it into the title</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">so literally about two weeks after the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">idw was named</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">fortunately thanks to youtube podcasting</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">and however else you get shows like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">the mainstream media strangle hold on</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">which really is a stranglehold on your</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">ability to think clearly</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">about the issues of the day is crumbling</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">at an incredible rate</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">now the question is who and what will</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">replace it</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">a few months ago one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">people to sit across this table from</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">eric weinstein came up with the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">intellectual dark web to describe this</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">eclectic mix of people from sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">to ben shapiro to his brother brett</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">weinstein to jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">all of whom are figuring out ways to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">have the important and often dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">conversations that are completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">ignored</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">by the mainstream this this next clip is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">a set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">um little pieces from jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">heather heing and a few other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">who&#39;ve been in our films</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like a herd of cats right</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">because so i&#39;ve thought about well what</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">what unites us to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">there&#39;s an us because that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">there&#39;s enough of an us so that the name</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">emerged and it&#39;s stuck</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">so so there&#39;s something in common</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:32.479" style="s2">because otherwise the name</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have stuck right you can&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.479" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">people in the group tend to reject</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">orthodoxy tend to reject ideology</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">tend to be interested in first</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:50.479" style="s2">principles thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">meaning that if you you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.479" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">on faith it&#39;s a very smart</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">concept to try to corral a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">difficult group of very disparate people</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">into one orbit i would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">it is actually the manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">process of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">that&#39;s more important than the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">conclusions that are generated you need</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">a group of people who are willing to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">hey you know you made a better point</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">i&#39;ve changed my mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">and i&#39;ve learned something that i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">think about and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">that kind of integrity in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">is what characterizes a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">internal idw discussion to me it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">people agree</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">not on their positions they may not even</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">agree as to what the facts are but they</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">usually agree as to what constitutes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">so yeah the idw was kind of a coming to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">of a conversation that been growing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">organically online for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">and then when it when it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">surfaced it caught on because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">people recognized it</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">as a kind of emergent phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">one of the people on our channel daniel</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">thorson talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">peterson in particular jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">in particular breaking a conversational</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">seal which i thought was a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">beautiful way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">in this talk i&#39;d like to to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">kind of what the initial idea of the idw</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">and whether it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of lived up</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">to its promise</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">lived up to its ideals and lived up to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">the kind of initial pitch</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">and i think it it both has and hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly very very successful i</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">i&#39;m part of about four or five different</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">facebook groups set off off the back of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">the idw</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">and it certainly worked as a meme like</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">it took off i think jordan peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">framing of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">it the name stuck and it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">refers to something</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">and that sort of question of what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">refers to i think is really at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">center of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">kind of point because it&#39;s it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">seen is it is it a meme</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">is it a particular group of people is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">a way of conversing there&#39;s all of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">different ideas and i think all of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">truth and i&#39;d like to kind of go through</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">some of those different</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">uh ways of looking at it and also talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">what i think it represents and i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">one of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">is this sort of alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">ecosystem it was kind of a coming to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">consciousness of an alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">the kind of official coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">idw was this new york times article that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">came out</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">in over a year ago so barry weiss is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">opinion uh writer with the new york</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">times and she wrote this piece</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">that was was kind of the the lightning</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">rod</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:27.919" style="s2">it had already existed so sam harris had</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">talked about it i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.919" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">eric weinstein i talked about it dave</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">rubin had talked about it and this was</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">the new york times kind of giving it his</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">blessing a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">and so the official kind of start in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">mainstream media was was about this time</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">there was a paradox of it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">shifting because as soon as it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">acknowledged by the mainstream media it</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">was no longer dark</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a kind of paradox and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">was criticized at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">people were saying how can you say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">um joe rogan who&#39;s probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">broadcaster around is in this dark web</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">this is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">so and that that&#39;s kind of true a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">the people in there are some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">popular and most</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">successful podcasters and media</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">personalities like douglas murray in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">uk as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">editor of the spectator or the</p>

<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind of paradox i&#39;ll read</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">out the names of all of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">were in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">first new york times article so sam</p>

<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">was the key so there were pictures of</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">maybe 10 altogether of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">are in there and these all very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">heavily stylized pictures like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">it was a deliberate sort of um i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">know what would you say almost a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">mystique around it from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">um and it&#39;s interesting as well that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">eric is the first person featured</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:06.399" style="s2">because eric is probably is nowhere near</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">as well known as say dave rubin or</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.399" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">joe rogan but that&#39;s quite significant i</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">think there was a few sort of central</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">thoughts that the idw centered around as</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">as we heard already in some of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">clips the idea that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">things that can and can&#39;t be said in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">that long-form content allows for</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">the exploration of ideas that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">mainstream media is now sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">putting into like 30-second sound bites</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">if you&#39;re lucky and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">and that just encourages polarization it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">encourages</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">um oppositional thinking and maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">can start to kind of have much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">nuanced discussions</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">um but also it&#39;s formed around the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">that there are certain ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">so nuanced and so difficult to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">takes of gender as an example like</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s the obviously the cathy</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">newman jordan peterson discussion that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">if you force it into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">perspective you just you can&#39;t do it it</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">needs longer to explain</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">and a nuanced perspective to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">held</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:11.360" style="s2">and and also but there&#39;s a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">story to the idw as well that i think we</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.360" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">explored quite well in the second film</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">so we did glitch in the matrix one and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">then we did glitch in the matrix two</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">that was who&#39;s seen that has anyone seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">that you&#39;re nodding have you seen it</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">no you&#39;ve seen it um so glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">matrix two was really eric weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">why he thought the the idw was necessary</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">where it came from and he has a a story</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">that goes back</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">to the 1980s and he i</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">and i believe him i believe his story i</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">think he&#39;s i think he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">he&#39;s on to something so eric weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">is a mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">physicist and gave a talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">to oxford in i think 2009 where he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">got a a theory called geometric</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">unity that he thinks could be a theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">of everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">so this is the kind of level that he</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">kind of is looking at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">about the world on and his theory is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">that looking at the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">since the 1980s what we&#39;ve done in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">west</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">is created institutions that have kept</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">out heterodox thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">where like the fresh ideas usually come</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">from the marginal figures</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">the difficult figures the ones who won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">go along with the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">and that we&#39;ve created um structures</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">that basically push those people out</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.399" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">and that&#39;s what for him the idw is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">that&#39;s within the media it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">people who&#39;ve been pushed out and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">the perspectives have been pushed out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">the media</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">but his theory about the idw goes all</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">down to that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">advance in physics that&#39;s why biology is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">stuck</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.760" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">this is something that brett talks about</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">like biology has been stuck</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">since the 1960s eric says like string</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">theory is a completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">turn it&#39;s unverifiable all of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.959" end="00:12:59.839" style="s2">different areas have become stuck at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">same time because of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.839" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">central idea that we&#39;ve pushed out all</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">the heterodox thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">and we&#39;ve done it because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.079" style="s2">understand that these difficult</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">characters</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.079" end="00:13:11.360" style="s2">of of which eric is definitely one um</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.360" end="00:13:15.200" style="s2">a lot of a lot of his a lot of his story</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.200" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">the the story and glitch in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">too is based around his experience as</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">well why he</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">why he felt that his ideas weren&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">respected weren&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">um taken in and and why all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">institutions have got stuck at the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the the the idw is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">the the public face</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">of a conversation that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">within the lots of these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">that have been captured by groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">captured by consensus so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">sort of deeper layer to it um</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:51.920" style="s2">because sometimes on on the films that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">we put out we get comments on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.920" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:56.560" style="s2">this was just a kind of this was just a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">one-off conversation this was just</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.560" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">eric was just throwing something out</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">you&#39;re reading too much into this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:04.880" style="s2">maybe but eric&#39;s possibly reading too</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">much into it as well um</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.880" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m also convinced that um</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">again i don&#39;t know this i&#39;ve obviously</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">spoken a fair bit to some of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">people behind the scenes but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">know this</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">from those conversations i&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:20.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">eric&#39;s a very persuasive guy and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">pretty sure that he&#39;s persuaded a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">the other members of the idw</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">this is the this is what the overall</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of an existential</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">threat from that perspective like there</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">um yeah there&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.639" style="s2">narrative underneath a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">so this talk is really that the central</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">question for me is</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">whether the idw is is still creating</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">novelty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">still creating newness because it i</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">sense that it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">at the beginning of um when i first</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">became aware of it mostly on the rubin</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">report you had</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">conversations between sam harris no</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">sorry between</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">ben shapiro and jordan peterson that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">seemed to be going into new territory</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">you had</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">conversations between brett and eric</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">that seemed to be going into new</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">territory and there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">aliveness</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">to the conversations that i&#39;ve not seen</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">so much of recently</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.199" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">and i wonder why that is i&#39;ve got a few</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">ideas um</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">i also want to say that what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:18.079" style="s2">now i&#39;d love this to start a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.079" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">i know that we&#39;re kind of doing this for</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">um for youtube as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">these are my ideas like this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">final word on it i&#39;m i&#39;m sort of putting</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">out some ideas but this is just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">starting a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">why this might be the case if it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s not creating as much novelty</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">as it did</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">so again sort of coming back to what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">the idw</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:44.639" style="s2">is it this group of people or is it a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">way of interacting one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.639" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">perspectives is from um a guy called</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">ryan bennett</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">who was central to the idw</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">meetup in new york after</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">a conference there failed to happen he</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">he sort of took so he&#39;s quite he&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">connected with a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">in the idw and i really like this so his</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">concept is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">he&#39;s a he&#39;s a computer programmer and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">trying to make sense of the idw by</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">looking at who&#39;s in it is like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">sense of the internet by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">what&#39;s on your hard drives</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">so the i try and see it as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">network protocol</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">so a network how do you understand the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">internet well you understand how the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">computers are talking to each other what</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">the ip</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">protocols are that tells you a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">about what the internet is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">than the the contents of what&#39;s on it</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">um and i like i like this as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">um when you pursue truth instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">power you&#39;re in the idw and you favor</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">understanding over judgment</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">value ideas more than identity you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">the idw again</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">i think it&#39;s really worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">these as ideals and asking kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">the the conversations in the idw have</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.440" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">lived up to these ideals um</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d like to play the clip number</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">five this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">this is brett and eric on the ruben</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">report this for me is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">compelling</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">framings of what the conversation of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">idw</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">should talk about and the territory it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:22.240" style="s2">should cover</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">and once we give up on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.240" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">on the map today has the answer with</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">respect to the policies that we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">supposed to embrace once we say actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">everybody&#39;s policies are a failure if we</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:34.799" style="s2">were to enact</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">uh the libertarian program it would fail</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">game theoretic reasons if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">enact the socialist program</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">it would fail for game theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">same thing right so the point is okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">fresh sheet of paper with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:47.679" style="s2">policy now there&#39;s a lot for us to talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.679" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">starting from values you can say we</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have the answer we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">know it&#39;s very important that the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">who are certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">be silent because they are not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">important people at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">yeah i find that quite a um compelling</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">and taking yeah just sort of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">that we need a new form of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">with a new a new set of starting points</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">um i want to go back to who is in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">the idw because there&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">who are who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">being framed as being part of it and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">one of the a good place to start is with</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">uh stephen pinker</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:29.919" style="s2">said everyone know who stephen pinker is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.919" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">so i&#39;ll just recap very quick very</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">quickly he&#39;s a is he at harvard</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">uh yeah yeah and he&#39;s a team</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">yeah and he what&#39;s his official um</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">professor of linguistics psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">holistics perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">yeah cool so stephen pinker famously</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">is a famous big head</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">academic who keeps</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">writing the same book about how the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">world&#39;s getting better and better and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">better and how everything is wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">and we just should be be grateful for</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">the miraculous times that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">um and he&#39;s also spoken out about some</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">of the same topics that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">members of the idw talk about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">the ideological capture of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">universities and some of those big</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">topics</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">and he&#39;s often linked him with the idw</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s i think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">it&#39;s very illustrative about what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">idw is to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">why i don&#39;t think he is and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">that most of the idw core would probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">not think that he was as well at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">from the way that they explained the idw</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">um and that&#39;s because and this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">tension within</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:40.799" style="s2">within the sort of core of the idw as</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">well because i see it most cleanly and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">sort of jordan peterson but</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">this are we living in the the best of</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">times or are we living in a world that</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">degrading fast and we&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">and i hear jordan peterson sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">speak to one side of that and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">speak to the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">but stephen pinker is clearly on that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">side of things eric</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">and brett and i&#39;d say sam harris as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">and maybe some of the other members of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">the idw are very much on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">if you watch glitch in the matrix 2 the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">film with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">with eric he frames it very much as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">kind of existential crisis and we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">create spaces where we can speak freely</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">because of this existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">so i think that that for me takes the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">idw</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.799" style="s2">as it was originally conceived out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">the realm of just</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.799" end="00:20:35.360" style="s2">kind of anti-like pro pro free speech</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">movement it&#39;s more than that as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.360" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">originally kind of conceived</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">and so now i&#39;m going to move on to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">kind of given the pitch for what the idw</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">is meant to achieve and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">and now i&#39;d like to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">about what some of the criticisms are</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">what i consider um valid criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:55.039" style="s2">the idw</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">and the first i&#39;d love to play that clip</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.039" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">from and this is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">prophetic in a way because this is again</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">eric and brett talking on the rubin</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">report</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to come back to dave rubin</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">quite a bit later on because</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">he&#39;s such a central figure in the idw</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">framed very much as the home of the idw</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">and also host of many of the original</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">and i think he&#39;s so identified with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">flaws in his um</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">the way he conducts himself and now kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">of reflecting on a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">a lot the idw in general but this i</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">think is one of the really key</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">points of the dangers of of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:41.360" style="s2">movement maybe there&#39;s a missing piece</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">here which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">our economic system when you plug it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">into certain things</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">very directly like journalism i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">actually this is your point of view</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">that is truth-seeking which cannot</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">withstand direct contact with market</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">that when you do that you generate um</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">artificially feeble truth-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">and it eventually invades them all so</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">how hard is it to beat the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">news outlets</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">not very hard because they&#39;re so bad at</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">delivering very hearted analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to beat them at some kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">of competition right</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">competitively they&#39;re extremely dominant</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">but in terms of what they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">deliver</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">they&#39;re terrible um likewise the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">university system</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">yeah because i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.320" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">initially the way that the idw was</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">framed was that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">because they&#39;re not part of a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">structure because they are they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">their own podcasts they</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">have independent audience and their</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">independent means they can be they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">avoid that sort of capture by market</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">forces and corporate forces</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">case i mean i know</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">from running a youtube channel you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">constantly aware of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">what the commenters are saying on your</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">your channel and you get to kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">feel that as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">gravitational force you know what they</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">like you know what they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve started monetizing it so you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">what the the paying fans want and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">and so it&#39;s absolutely the case that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">um if you&#39;re starting up a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">or if you&#39;re starting up your own media</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">channel you&#39;re not immune from those</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:17.919" style="s2">forces at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">and you&#39;re not immune from um so market</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.919" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">forces you can kind of look at kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">financial forces but you can also look</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">at it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">sex power and all those other social</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">dynamics are also market forces what</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">you&#39;re doing for</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">kind of rep for reputation and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">that starts to kind of interfere with</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:35.280" style="s2">searching for truth as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">just just the fact that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">comment thread and knowing what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">like and what they don&#39;t like you can i</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">mean if you you&#39;d have to not be human</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">to not</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">to not feel that in some way yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">yeah i feel it too and i think we should</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">be honest about that and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">laugh at it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">and i think to sort of zoom out a little</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">bit of you know you and i have talked a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">lot before</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">and i keep coming back to this line of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:05.760" style="s2">the danger the dangers that lurk in</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">something like the idw conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">or even followers and fans of it is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">once this mistake that i&#39;ve come to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">notice or basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">profess is that there seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">trend of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">who think the moment that they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">rejected bad philosophy or a bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">philosophy it also means they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">rejected bad psychology</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">and they really have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">each other it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not susceptible to the lores of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">status and sex and money</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">and all of these other things and even</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">some if someone rejects a political</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">leaning being like oh i&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">the left is really wacky and has gone</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">overboard and look like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:45.279" style="s2">i woke to this in sort of the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">way or either side of that if</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.279" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">whatever your political epiphany is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve escaped the normal</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">trappings that we all deal with of weak</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">psychology and and they they relate but</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t correlate the way that i</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">think a lot of people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">to jump the gun and think they have and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">that goes for the personalities in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">idw that goes for the big names that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">all know who are on stage that goes for</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">people like you and i who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">sort of tell the story of these people</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">it goes for people following it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">i think we all have to just sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">honest about that again laugh about it a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">little bit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.840" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">if there&#39;s anything that binds us as</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">humans together that would be a great</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">thing to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">you know find common ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">even with your political enemies like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">we&#39;re all susceptible to these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">we should admit that and then what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">do with it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">is really important also once you</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">once you identify yourself as they did</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">the idw being a thing you start to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">create aligned intense</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">incentives like they&#39;re they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.000" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">uh speaking tours together or book deals</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">or all of that sort of stuff that starts</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">to come in</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">and then especially on something like</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">twitter where you&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">is innately tribalizing you&#39;re then</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">sticking up for each other and those</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">kind of factors</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">so you start to create a tribe around an</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">anti-tribal</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">um ideology you it sort of becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">little bit paradoxical</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">and and i think that paradox has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">playing out quite a bit um</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">and talk a little bit about like one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">the things i think the idw</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">at its best or the members of the idw at</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">their best</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">do is create a sort of high resolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:28.799" style="s2">critique of um</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">culture like cultural movements gender</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.799" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">is a perfect example that i&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">about before</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">like those conversations have to be had</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">with real nuance and real</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.039" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">real delicacy and they&#39;re very easily as</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">soon as they come down to a lower level</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">a low resolution perspective and i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s almost like a lie</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">um the high resolution perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">very illuminating the low resolution one</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">is just a cliche</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">and i think at their best some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">people in the idw do hold that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:01.679" style="s2">that um high resolution critique</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">but at their worst i think they do uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.679" end="00:27:07.120" style="s2">slip to a low resolution critique</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">um like jordan peterson at his best is</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.120" end="00:27:09.440" style="s2">very high resolution at his worst he</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">it comes down to very sort of it can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">quite simplistic kind of reacting</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">against the excesses of the left and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">it just becomes quite kind of cliched um</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">dave rubin who&#39;s highly identified with</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">the idw</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">like his his whole thing is like how the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">left has gone insane</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s pretty much the whole frame</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">that he that he puts everything through</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s that&#39;s not searching</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:36.159" style="s2">after truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">i mean if you&#39;re going to search after</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">truth i think you need to have a more</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">high resolution critique than that also</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">this sense of tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">is kind of going against tribalism has</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">it created new tribalism i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">the piece here that kathy young wrote</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">for collette</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">um where she she looked at what is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">unifying</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">factor behind the people who are seen as</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">being part of the idw</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s often been called reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">um and i i know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">people in the idw wouldn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">phrase but i think there is some truth</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">in it i think they are reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">and the question is whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">something that needs to be reacted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:23.840" style="s2">like how widespread is</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">the ideological capture of um</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">institutions now and how dangerous is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">and the biggest criticism of the idw i</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">think and kathy points to that in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">piece is</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">that they are becoming tribalists</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">themselves just there are these</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">these huge forces that pull you towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">tribalization especially on social media</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">um particularly on twitter where most of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">this conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">is happening so so a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">commentary on the idw is kind of asking</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">okay what is the thing that unites the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">people within it</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">and i mean obviously part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">going to be sort of a resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">extreme kind of ideological uh thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">on the left what you might call kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">woke culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s a question of what that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">actually means and whether that is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">new dividing line in culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">yuri harris had a few articles in</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">colette around that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">and eric weinstein has kind of agreed</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">with that and he says that the main</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">dividing line is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">upgrade to the left if you break</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">progressivism or the left or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">into the traditional liberal core</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">of the left and then uh you augment that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:34.960" style="s2">with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">fairly recent extremely aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.960" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">which appears willing to attack</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">reason civility as agents of oppression</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">you know are tools of oppression</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">um i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">upgrade is really what is it an issue</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">and a question</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">what is it what is being questioned</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">and if you believe that upgrade that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">extremely post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">um adjustment to classically</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">progressive positions if you think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">is now the new dominant</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">left and it&#39;s not going away you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">probably take a fairly dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">attitude towards the entire left of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">cannon of thought and i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">there are members of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">of the idw who believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">that uh this current aggressive strain</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">has displaced classically liberal or</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">classically progressive positions</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">which will never return and that we now</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">need to deal with the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">is permanent and those people have</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">um decided that they are going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">abandon any hope</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">in a left-of-center position well i held</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">that position that that upgrade if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">that marginal difference um in a level</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:00.240" style="s2">of aggression</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:01.679" style="s2">and willingness to attack reason and</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.679" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">and itself in favor of tying people in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">logically and epistemologically um if i</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">thought that was permanent</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.720" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">i would understand exactly why people</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">were completely abandoning</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">any kind of high-resolution view of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">they&#39;re saying that but i disagree i</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">believe that many people are fairly</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.760" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">moderate and liberal in their views</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">and are going through a period akin to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">the mccarthy era which i&#39;ve called left</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">1.0 was about left versus right what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">actually have</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">now is a kind of fragmentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">where we have maybe i don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">how many maybe 12</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">different what he called mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">fighting each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">and he did a spreadsheet with all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">their memetic tribes like what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">believe and how</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">a lot of the the real fighting that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:27.200" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing at the moment is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.840" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">in the left like between different</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">tribes on the left or between different</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">tribes on the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">and he yeah really worth checking this</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">on out maybe we can send you some of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">links after</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">after the talk um and in this he also</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">talked about the value</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">of what he called mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">which is like how do you mediate between</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">the different warring tribes</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a really really</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">valuable concept that i&#39;d like to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">being spread a bit more because that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">that&#39;s another criticism of the idw that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">i think is worth making</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">is i don&#39;t see them reaching out so much</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">to people in other tribes</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">and looking at kind of negotiating</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">between them if</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t see much strategy in having</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">people from</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">different tribes onto their shows for</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">example in dialoguing with them i see</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">them mostly commenting and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">within their particular tribe um</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">and then there&#39;s often kind of defenses</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">where people talk about bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">faith you can&#39;t talk to that person</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">they&#39;re a bad faith actor</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:28.159" style="s2">i would i would probably i&#39;d suggest</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.159" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">um yeah memetic mediation is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">finding someone who is in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">tribes but is able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">able to dialogue so i think people right</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">in the center of those tribes are</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">probably unreachable but there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.559" style="s2">people on the outside who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">open to dialogue and open to to</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.559" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t see that happening so often</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">the other criticism of the idw</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">i would say is the need to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a dialogue between</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">eric weinstein and sam harris saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">that they&#39;re both getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">they feel that they&#39;re getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">because most of the criticism that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve had so far has been really</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">low quality and that they need better</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">better quality criticism</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">yeah and the other point is that the idw</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">was very</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">specifically framed as an environment a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">group of people who would come together</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">discuss things and potentially change</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">minds</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">and i genuinely can&#39;t think of a single</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">where someone in the idw has changed</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">their mind over</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:31.919" style="s2">anything significant over what the last</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">18 months or so since the idw came along</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.919" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">and if the idw is a project that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">is able to kind of carve out a beachhead</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">and then potentially</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">create an a space in culture for people</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">to cha have conversations and change</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:44.159" style="s2">their minds</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">if they&#39;re not even doing that within</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.159" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">the idw itself how on earth they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">do that or model that for everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">to eric&#39;s point probably about what what</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">want in sort of in any system you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">a method of error detection and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">correction david deutsch is my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">thinker i think i tweet about him more</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">than anyone else i&#39;m a huge fan of david</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">deutsch&#39;s work and he sort of pins</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">that um sentence as may if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">commandment of the universe that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">could try to derive from the universe</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">itself and the famous is off distinction</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">it would be something like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">that sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">and building the systems to detect and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">correct errors of course you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">decide what an</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">error is and that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">philosophical question is the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">important thing and for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">eric&#39;s right for thinkers you what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">want is an incubator that can detect and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">correct errors</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">um and if it becomes tribal and it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">biases that start building within it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">that it that there&#39;s certain errors that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">are never detected maybe i&#39;m pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">some of the errors of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">you know pretending that we&#39;re animals</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">that suddenly don&#39;t want sex because</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">we&#39;re sitting in an idw</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">room or something like that you want you</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.599" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">want an ability to detect and correct</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:59.760" style="s2">errors</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">and open discussion and a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.760" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">is um is important to uphold so in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:12.079" style="s2">tribal thinking if it becomes um</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">if it becomes unable to to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.079" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">correct itself is is i would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">an objective wrong and an objective evil</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">in the universe to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:23.119" style="s2">borrow some more deutsche language and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">and central to that i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">is is dave rubin because dave reuben has</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">center who here knows who does everyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">here know who dave reuben is</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">reuben report um</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">so i&#39;ve got a little clip um so a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">clip of the interview that i did with</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">with dave</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.839" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">um in the summer i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">um yeah yeah well i guess if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">physical center</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">of the intellectual dark web it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">here i mean it&#39;s in my garage because i</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">think this</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">is where not where the ideas all started</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">but at least where most of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">connections between the people started</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">and you know people ask me my role in</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">this whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">whether it is a thing at all you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">whether it is some sort of card carrying</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">organization or it&#39;s this loose</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">affiliation or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">it is uh i think my role in it is i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">been a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">connective tissue between the people and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">the criticism i&#39;ve seen is that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">don&#39;t push back hard enough against</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">when they maybe deserve it that you give</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">an easy ride to people</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">listen i would say i&#39;m interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">people the way i like to interview them</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">i like to sit across from somebody look</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:32.320" style="s2">them in the eye</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:34.240" style="s2">and figure out what their ideas are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.320" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">bigger you get the more relevant you get</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.240" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">the more haters are going to come out</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">but the more that legitimate criticism</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">will come out too and again</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">i address this all the time what do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">think is the most legitimate criticism</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not really for me to say what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">legitimate criticism of me</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">if someone wants to say that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">like the way i interview or that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">ask hard enough questions or something</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">well i suppose that is a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">criticism of me</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not the way i like doing my</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:03.040" style="s2">business and you know if you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:04.079" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing then i would say you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.040" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">don&#39;t have to watch</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.079" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">i wanted to interview him and i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">wanting to interview him for a while</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.960" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">after seeing those first reuben report</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">shows and but when i started researching</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">in the run-up to it and i was just</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">looking at some of his old old programs</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">i was thinking out there&#39;s something a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">off here and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">so reuben famously interviews</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">controversial figures</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s fine i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">valuable thing to do but</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">only if you&#39;re giving the audience the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:34.160" style="s2">necessary information to make up their</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">own minds about who these people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.160" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">ask them push them about certain things</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">that they&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">so in the in the research for it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">subsequently there&#39;s an amazing series</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">of films by a guy called timber on toast</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">called dave rubin&#39;s battle of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">which is a fantastic watch it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">literally four hours</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">of forensic analysis of what the reuben</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">report does and how it does it</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">that is really an amazing piece of work</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">a running theme which i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">constantly shining a spotlight on</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">throughout this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:07.359" style="s2">is exploring how well the reuben report</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">does in achieving its</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.359" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">main goal of fostering open and honest</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">about ideas yeah timber it&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">to catch up</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">i really enjoyed your your films and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">looked like you put an awful lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">into making them</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:24.079" style="s2">why did you go to so much work like four</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">hours</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.079" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">just based on the ruben report the main</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">reason was</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">um i could see that there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">criticism emerging online but that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">people would rarely</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">provide substantive examples of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">things that they were accusing dave</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">of um and i think when you&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">criticism without examples or without</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">like justification</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">it does come across as quite sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">malicious</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">good faith</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">um so my main motivation in making the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">videos was</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">so i knew the examples because i</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">followed dave for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">from the beginning of his show like</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">2015. um</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">i&#39;d been there for all the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">example interviews as the ad that come</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:12.319" style="s2">up the ones that i sort of pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">and i thought if i assemble these in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.319" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">tight structure that people can easily</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">follow people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">have watched them and people who have</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">never watched him then</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">at least when these criticism come up</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">people can look into them</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:26.400" style="s2">and know what they&#39;re based on if after</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">watching my videos</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.400" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">they have no problem still with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">interview style or the way he conducts</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">that&#39;s fine uh but at least then they</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">that they know</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">what it&#39;s based on so so how would you</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">summarize</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">those criticisms so i&#39;d say firstly that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">he never pushes back on guess therefore</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">whenever there is an idea presented that</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">needs to be investigated</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">into like its strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">the audience</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:55.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t given a chance to explore that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">because they don&#39;t see the counter</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.920" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">argument or the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:02.319" style="s2">and the other criticism would be that he</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">sanitizes and savory characters</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.319" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">um not by platforming them which i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">is the straw man kind of argument of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">what it is i think he sanitizes them by</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">presenting them as something they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">whenever there&#39;s a chance to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">bottom of some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">controversial thing they&#39;ve said in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">past he skirts around it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">or does something to obfuscate it i</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">think those are the two main criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">you almost have to go to that level to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">really sort of to see what&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">um but but generally he&#39;ll have stefan</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">molyneux or</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">tommy robinson who&#39;s a famous kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">sort of street fighting politician from</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:40.000" style="s2">the uk katie hopkins is a</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">and he he doesn&#39;t ask them those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.400" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">questions doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t put their</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">words to them</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.119" end="00:41:52.800" style="s2">if dave&#39;s interviews expose that people</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">at the forefront of his struggle against</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.800" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">the authoritarian left were xenophobic</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">or misogynistic or white supremacists or</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:41:59.599" style="s2">rape apologists</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">it would deprecate the viewers</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">and their connection to its emotional</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">core dave therefore has to carefully</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">sidestep around his guests</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">as a journalist i felt i had to push him</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">on that and had to ask him those</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">um and what i&#39;ve seen since is</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">people who criticize him or</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">ask questions about the show i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">him do that a lot on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">and he claims that no one he claims that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">left wingers don&#39;t want to go on the</p>

<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">program since about like early time in</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">high school now i&#39;m in college so</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s been a while but um one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">i really liked</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">something that you talked about here was</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">the difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">diversity of thought and diversity of</p>

<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">sure now the thing with a diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">thought is i feel like that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">you actually perpetuate on your show</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">because the only time you really have</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">left-wing guests are when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">members of the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">such as harris or weinstein and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">only there for the bulk of the time</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">to uh talk about the regressive left and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">pretty much wanted to ask you why won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">you have sam or sam cedar on</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s recording it too okay yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">mean the guy&#39;s just he&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">dishonest player who&#39;s just lied about</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">being repeatedly like</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:21.839" style="s2">i&#39;m not gonna do it so would you be</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:24.160" style="s2">willing to have natalie wynn of contra</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.839" end="00:44:25.599" style="s2">point or david pakman or kyle kalinski</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.160" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">all of these are progressives who have</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">i&#39;m not in principle i&#39;m not against</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">having any of them but i&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.319" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">have people that attacked me personally</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">i think it&#39;s pretty obvious if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">what i did up here</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">like i don&#39;t attack people personally</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">i&#39;m happy to talk about ideas</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna go after me personally if</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:39.359" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna lie about me and slander me</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">and things like that like</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.359" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just not the game i&#39;m playing</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no win in it you know i have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">certain set of rules when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">talking to people and how i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">behave as a public person</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">so he wasn&#39;t very happy with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">interview i did um</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">had very little contact with him</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">afterwards and then it kind of shut down</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">completely and i&#39;ve heard now that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">that has happened to a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">people who&#39;ve tried to raise any any</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">concerns</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">with him and i i think it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">highlighting this because i think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">illustrates quite a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">dangers of the idw this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">slipping down to a tribal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">also i i genuinely think that this he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">obviously not the only person that does</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">this but i think he&#39;s probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">high profile person who does</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">what i see him doing on twitter is</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">framing anyone who criticizes them as</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">being back</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">motivated by bad faith or kind of a bad</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">basically a quillette which is run by</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">about four hit pieces on me recently</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:50.319" style="s2">where they&#39;re really trying to single me</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.920" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">out out of the idw crew</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">that i&#39;m somehow the worst because i sit</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">down and and talk to some people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t like and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">talk to these people on the right and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2">don&#39;t question them exactly as they want</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">and they keep just writing piece after</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">piece now i got a ton of haters</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">these days</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">which really is just the sign that i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">why they&#39;re coming down on me</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">because i&#39;ve left and i&#39;ve survived and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">you got to extract a pretty heavy price</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">on a guy like that because if you look</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">at my resume if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">back of a baseball card and you look at</p>

<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">okay so ken wilber is a philosopher he</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">created something called integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">in about the 90s so it had a real</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">high point in the 90s and early 2000s al</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">gore was a real fan of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">integral theory so there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">sliding doors moment</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">with the florida election was if al gore</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">had become</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">become president we might be living in a</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">but but ken wilber has this</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">theory about how consciousness evolves</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">that i think is really really useful as</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">to see where the idw</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">sometimes slips into a very simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">narrative and when it sometimes goes</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">so this is a little graphic that i made</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">and remains influential after serious</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">some of the things that he leaves out</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">i find this a little bit interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">because he&#39;s clearly an integral thinker</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">to get the most out of this film</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">we&#39;ll need to introduce a little</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:29.200" style="s2">integral terminology</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">at the core of integral theory is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.200" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">idea that cultures and societies go</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">through specific levels of development</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">in the same way as individuals do</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">becoming more sophisticated as they</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">develop</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">or grow up it&#39;s an idea that&#39;s common to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">developmental theorists</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">including peterson&#39;s favorite jean</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.319" style="s2">piaget</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">you move from one knowledge structure to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.319" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">the next one which includes the previous</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">and is better and it&#39;s better because it</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">covers more territory</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">that&#39;s how you know it&#39;s better it does</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">the same thing the old tool does</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">plus some additional things so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">definition of better</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:04.960" style="s2">integral theory represents this</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">development as a spiral</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.960" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">in this film we&#39;ll mostly be talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:12.240" style="s2">about amber</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">tribalism ethnocentric authoritarian</p>

<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">emerged fully</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">in the 1960s they&#39;re healthily</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">they support each other but each of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:48.079" style="s2">can believe that their way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">the world is the only true way</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.079" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">and then they are mutually exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">for wilbur the incomprehension between</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">these world views</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">is what&#39;s causing many of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">excesses of the culture wars</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">above these levels wilbur says is</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">another level</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">called integral or second tier</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:10.000" style="s2">from this perspective it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.319" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">each of the previous ways of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">world has value</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">and needs to be integrated um</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know if this is really</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">confusing or helpful but</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">basically the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">so ken wilber&#39;s map and i&#39;ve met a few</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:28.559" style="s2">people who talk about this as</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">an integral os like an integral</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.559" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">operating system</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">is very very helpful to understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:38.319" style="s2">with what happened when so green post</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">modern was</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.319" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">uh civil rights feminism the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">that before then you had</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">orange values which was basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">there&#39;s one way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s based on science it&#39;s based on kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s based on a sort of single</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.559" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">perspective and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">what we had coming in in the 60s and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:57.359" style="s2">developing after it was the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:51:58.720" style="s2">there are multiple perspectives that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.359" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">not being included</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.720" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s an advance that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.000" end="00:52:05.599" style="s2">that realization is actually an advance</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">on the previous one because there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">perspectives that are not included there</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">voices that are not being heard bringing</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">those in is really essential</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">but what can happen and what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">um over the last 10 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">by wilbur&#39;s um uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">perspective is that if you if you forget</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">that or what you can end up with is just</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">a cacophony of voices like you lose the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">idea of truth altogether like true ever</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">all truth is relative so you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">lost the idea of any kind of central</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:38.079" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost the eye all truths just</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">become perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">and then what you end up in is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">narcissism and nicholas</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">and if that&#39;s where we are and i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">that there&#39;s some truth to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">um that the theory is that these these</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">these levels of development</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">um they they emerge and then they become</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">pathological just before we move on to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">new level of development</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">um so i think from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">what the idw is generally doing is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">pointing out most of the flaws with</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">green with postmodern with saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">there is a truth um it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">and the danger is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">i think at its worst the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">idw don&#39;t see that that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">a positive value that it is valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">see different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">and the idea with integral the teal one</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.960" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">at the top</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">is that it&#39;s its second tier</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">is considered um an evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">consciousness where you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.440" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">start to see that all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">levels before have some value and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">where i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">at its best the thinkers on um</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">the intellectual dark web and i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">include someone like jonathan height</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">here as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">he he&#39;s very good at seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">most of our political beliefs are</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:03.280" style="s2">temperamental</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">so thinking that someone&#39;s kind of worse</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.280" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">or better based on their political</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">beliefs is like you&#39;re judging someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:08.240" style="s2">for the way that they&#39;re wired rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.240" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">uh just their for for what they think</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s an e-book that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">ken wilber wrote around this called</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">trump and a post-truth world i would</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">really highly recommend if anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">interested to know know more about this</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">this frame and my sort of final thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">that eric in glitch in the matrix ii</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">and in his sort of framing of the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:36.079" style="s2">idea of the idw was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s needed to because of the corrupting</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.079" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">effect of group think and aligned</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">incentives within institutions</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">and the kind of paradox is that by</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">creating the idw i think they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">actually made themselves subject to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:49.119" style="s2">of those same forces</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">and and that&#39;s a kind of paradox of in</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">the naming and creation of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">it sort of has allowed it to be captured</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">by some of those same forces</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">so thank you very much for for listening</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">few questions in a q a now</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">rebel wisdom was set up to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">the world at a deeper level than the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">it was built for these times of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">and change</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">which is why we want to do what we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">to meet the challenge of the times</p>
