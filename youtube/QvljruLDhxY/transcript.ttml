<p begin="00:00:11.010" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">podcast livestream r16 we have heard you</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">internet loud and clear and we promise</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:24.689" style="s2">you more cat Belle is coming not only</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">more frequency of the Rings but higher</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.689" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">amplitude so stay tuned for that I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">sitting with dr. Heather huiying we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:32.700" style="s2">many things planned for today we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">going to have a discussion that will</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.700" end="00:00:36.600" style="s2">last for whatever period of time it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">lasts and then we will switch we will</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.600" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">take a break and then we will switch to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:42.510" style="s2">another link which will be findable in</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:44.789" style="s2">the description to this video at which</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.510" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">we will take your super chat questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.789" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">so you can file those questions during</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:51.989" style="s2">our discussion here and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">take as many of those as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.989" end="00:00:59.250" style="s2">then switch to super track questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:01:04.549" style="s2">filed in the Q&amp;A all right I thought we</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.250" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">would start today by talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.549" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">catastrophic meaning-making crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">we are facing and what we might do to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">bootstrap our way out of it let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:20.420" style="s2">all right so the place I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">is this as many of our longtime</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.420" end="00:01:25.460" style="s2">listeners and followers will know I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">an evolutionary theorist</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.460" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">now people do not generally have a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">grasp though on what theorists actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">do and I must say there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">about the term theorist that when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">somebody described himself as a theorist</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">I roll my eyes just like everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:45.619" style="s2">but nonetheless theorist is how I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">understand my my scientific role and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.619" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">what it means is that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">tools in the theorist toolkit which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">believe are not well understood by most</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">people that I think are actually vital</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">to the crisis that we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:03.770" style="s2">now let me just say that although this</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t where I thought we might be going</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.770" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">that when I hear theorist and you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">indeed an evolutionary theorist I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:13.130" style="s2">I&#39;m not really like I can play along but</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">it&#39;s not really what I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.130" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">more of an empiricist and I think of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:20.510" style="s2">those two things as counterpoint to one</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:22.990" style="s2">another and both as necessary and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.510" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you see these two</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.990" end="00:02:28.070" style="s2">approaches as sort of compatible with</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:31.220" style="s2">one another but very much describing</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.070" end="00:02:34.610" style="s2">different parts of the process is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.220" end="00:02:36.680" style="s2">yes would you say so 100% each necessary</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.610" end="00:02:39.380" style="s2">to the other in fact you will remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.680" end="00:02:40.970" style="s2">many years ago as I was engaging the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.380" end="00:02:43.640" style="s2">questions surrounding telomere</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.970" end="00:02:46.460" style="s2">senescence and cancer in a fit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.640" end="00:02:48.350" style="s2">frustration I wrote a mad poem and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.460" end="00:02:51.770" style="s2">very point was made in the center of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.350" end="00:02:57.530" style="s2">that poem about that these two things</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.770" end="00:02:59.270" style="s2">are they are hands that he loads best</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.530" end="00:03:01.070" style="s2">together was I think the phrase but in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.270" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">any case and I wish we had that poem</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.070" end="00:03:04.820" style="s2">right now we could read that poem that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">would be perfect it would be so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.820" end="00:03:09.860" style="s2">trying didn&#39;t think - yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">just need to define the terms and let me</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.860" end="00:03:13.250" style="s2">just let me start with empiricist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:15.560" style="s2">easier it&#39;s more straightforward it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.250" end="00:03:17.240" style="s2">is a in closer alignment to what people</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.560" end="00:03:19.640" style="s2">imagine if they have an accurate view of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.240" end="00:03:21.890" style="s2">what scientists tend to do and most</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.640" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">people don&#39;t think of theorists as even</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.890" end="00:03:25.460" style="s2">in the realm of possibility all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:28.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot we&#39;ve talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.460" end="00:03:29.450" style="s2">in past live streams about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.010" end="00:03:31.370" style="s2">difference between a hypothesis driven</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.450" end="00:03:33.980" style="s2">science which is also known as</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.370" end="00:03:36.500" style="s2">hypothetical deductive ism versus</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.980" end="00:03:39.800" style="s2">data-driven science I tend to use the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.500" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">square quotes versus you know conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.800" end="00:03:43.700" style="s2">driven conjecture which is being passed</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">off as data-driven science a lot these</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.700" end="00:03:51.410" style="s2">days both of these the theorists and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:52.910" style="s2">empiricists both ought to be if they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.410" end="00:03:55.340" style="s2">actually doing science driven by</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.910" end="00:03:59.150" style="s2">hypothesis in trying to you know driven</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.340" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">to either generate or generate</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.150" end="00:04:04.550" style="s2">hypothesis most fundamentally as what</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:06.590" style="s2">they&#39;re doing as opposed to most</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.550" end="00:04:12.650" style="s2">fundamentally be testing hypotheses and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.590" end="00:04:15.230" style="s2">so an empiricist often may be sonata</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.650" end="00:04:17.950" style="s2">mised mostly aptly with experimentalist</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.230" end="00:04:20.270" style="s2">is someone who makes an observation</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.950" end="00:04:22.870" style="s2">generates as many possible hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.270" end="00:04:25.870" style="s2">that there might be to explain that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.870" end="00:04:27.880" style="s2">observation generates prediction</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.870" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">which would inherently follow from each</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.880" end="00:04:32.980" style="s2">of those hypotheses and then begins to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">try to test those hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.980" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">specifically my hope hopefully in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:40.540" style="s2">pop Aryan universe trying to falsify</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:43.690" style="s2">those hypotheses and so it is that act</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.540" end="00:04:45.580" style="s2">of testing via either carefully</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:47.979" style="s2">controlled observation or experiment</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.580" end="00:04:48.699" style="s2">that is the empirical part of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.979" end="00:04:50.710" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.699" end="00:04:52.090" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t think that that description I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.710" end="00:04:53.710" style="s2">just gave doesn&#39;t include the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.090" end="00:04:56.530" style="s2">which is generally data analysis which</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.710" end="00:04:59.710" style="s2">generally statistical analysis and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.530" end="00:05:02.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t put as much of a focus on how</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.710" end="00:05:04.210" style="s2">how was it that you generate your</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.440" end="00:05:06.729" style="s2">hypotheses in the first place and are</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.210" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">you outside of the scope of what other</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.729" end="00:05:11.380" style="s2">people have even considered and so you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">know I found for instance that I had</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.380" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">particular skill I never knew before I</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:20.380" style="s2">started spending time in the field alone</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:21.639" style="s2">at yes making observations and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.380" end="00:05:23.340" style="s2">generating hypotheses and predictions</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.639" end="00:05:28.090" style="s2">but specifically in figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.340" end="00:05:30.190" style="s2">experiments would accurately test for</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.090" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">distinctions between hypotheses and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.190" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">that&#39;s what the empiricism is that what</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:36.729" style="s2">experimental design and then follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">data analysis would allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.729" end="00:05:40.300" style="s2">distinguish between hypotheses that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:42.340" style="s2">sort of more the realm of empiricists</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.300" end="00:05:44.470" style="s2">where as theorists spend more time</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.340" end="00:05:46.090" style="s2">earlier in the process and often are</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.470" end="00:05:48.550" style="s2">doing not sort of brick in the wall type</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.090" end="00:05:52.030" style="s2">science but parent you know would seek</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.550" end="00:05:55.150" style="s2">to do paradigm shifting science well</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.030" end="00:05:57.190" style="s2">there are two things in here one is what</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.150" end="00:06:00.580" style="s2">exactly does a theorist do and then the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.190" end="00:06:03.190" style="s2">other is what is their objective okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.580" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">and so let&#39;s just say I think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.190" end="00:06:09.160" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a confusion in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">public&#39;s imagination about theory that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.160" end="00:06:14.380" style="s2">arises from the expectation that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:17.970" style="s2">theorist generates theories which is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.380" end="00:06:21.490" style="s2">true a theorist cannot generate theories</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.970" end="00:06:23.560" style="s2">so let us step back into a dialogue that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.490" end="00:06:26.229" style="s2">we&#39;ve all heard many many times that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.560" end="00:06:29.460" style="s2">will begin to unearth the question so</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.229" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve all heard at some point some</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.460" end="00:06:34.539" style="s2">person advocating for the teaching of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:37.390" style="s2">some creation theory alongside Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.539" end="00:06:39.180" style="s2">in school or something and inevitably in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.390" end="00:06:41.690" style="s2">making the argument that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.180" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">be done they will make the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.690" end="00:06:46.970" style="s2">Darwinism is just a theory right and so</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.250" end="00:06:57.210" style="s2">actually a non sequitur right it&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.680" end="00:07:08.009" style="s2">understood precisely then the claim that</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.009" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense and this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:13.320" style="s2">always what you hear the scientific</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.210" end="00:07:22.410" style="s2">the word theory is as close to a fact as</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.150" end="00:07:27.419" style="s2">find that this isn&#39;t true the term</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.500" end="00:07:29.099" style="s2">theory is invoked all the time for</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.099" end="00:07:32.460" style="s2">as we ever get in science and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.780" end="00:07:34.620" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s used for things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.460" end="00:07:36.870" style="s2">aren&#39;t even remotely fact like and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.620" end="00:07:39.750" style="s2">don&#39;t when we it would be easy pickings</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.940" end="00:07:51.659" style="s2">and too liberally and frankly and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.310" end="00:07:53.099" style="s2">accurately but we don&#39;t have to go there</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.659" end="00:07:55.289" style="s2">we can we can stick to talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.099" end="00:07:59.190" style="s2">science and the misuse of the term</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.289" end="00:08:02.210" style="s2">within science right so theory is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.190" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">actually the top of a hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.210" end="00:08:06.840" style="s2">concepts and the reason that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:18.810" style="s2">different kinds of ideas fit together</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.259" end="00:08:21.570" style="s2">and lead to each other then one</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.810" end="00:08:24.030" style="s2">discovers that the tools for fixing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.570" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">meaning-making apparatus already exist</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.030" end="00:08:28.710" style="s2">they are well understood at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:31.020" style="s2">philosophical level but they are not</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">frequently see in the major journals</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.510" end="00:08:42.870" style="s2">papers that have no relationship they</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:45.500" style="s2">report data of some kind but have no</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.870" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">relationship to any hypothesis that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.500" end="00:08:50.670" style="s2">described anywhere and what you and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:52.860" style="s2">have generated over years of teaching is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.670" end="00:08:55.350" style="s2">the idea that every paper that report</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.860" end="00:08:57.209" style="s2">data ought to be doing one of two things</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.350" end="00:09:00.899" style="s2">and it ought to say which it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.209" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">either data leading to a hypothesis or</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.899" end="00:09:06.029" style="s2">data that tests a hypothesis data should</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:07.829" style="s2">never be collected in isolation of those</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.829" end="00:09:10.860" style="s2">unearth a pattern that needs an</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.000" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">explanation which would be a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.860" end="00:09:14.940" style="s2">or you&#39;re testing an explanation that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:16.740" style="s2">has been provided either by you or</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.940" end="00:09:19.980" style="s2">someone else in order to see whether or</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.740" end="00:09:21.720" style="s2">not it stands up to to that attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.980" end="00:09:23.339" style="s2">falsify it and this is in fact one way</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.720" end="00:09:25.589" style="s2">to make the distinction between data</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.339" end="00:09:27.720" style="s2">driven and hypothesis driven science the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.589" end="00:09:29.490" style="s2">data that were collected and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.720" end="00:09:31.890" style="s2">even love to use the term data here but</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.490" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">will do it data that were collected</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.890" end="00:09:37.560" style="s2">absent a hypothesis in which the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:40.230" style="s2">researchers were letting the data reveal</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.230" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually have any idea about what</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.459" end="00:09:55.950" style="s2">which is in fact a cycle that such that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.269" end="00:09:58.649" style="s2">they have now generated a hypothesis but</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.950" end="00:10:01.649" style="s2">the results of those papers that use</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.649" end="00:10:02.930" style="s2">data to produce a hypothesis even though</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.649" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not what they say they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.930" end="00:10:07.949" style="s2">compared to papers that actually test</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.060" end="00:10:24.779" style="s2">even tell the difference by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.860" end="00:10:26.730" style="s2">people talk about them or respond to</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.140" end="00:10:32.579" style="s2">in terms of the standards of proof that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.209" end="00:10:37.199" style="s2">they are then letting loose on the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.579" end="00:10:42.199" style="s2">yeah in fact there&#39;s a kind of rarely</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.199" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">spoken but widely detectable sense that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.199" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">hypothesis testing is almost an archaic</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:49.130" style="s2">mode that we&#39;ve gotten past it because</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:51.209" style="s2">things have gotten more complex or our</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.130" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">technology has allowed us to see into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.209" end="00:10:54.630" style="s2">level of detail where that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:56.730" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s nonsense I&#39;m reminded</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.630" end="00:10:58.709" style="s2">of the faculty member I taught with once</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.720" end="00:11:15.749" style="s2">ultimately get to the power tools and</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.079" end="00:11:22.589" style="s2">real point here is if you understand how</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.029" end="00:11:26.009" style="s2">these tools work and it isn&#39;t all that</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.540" end="00:12:39.660" style="s2">because it will always be driven to</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.320" end="00:13:54.120" style="s2">in modern science to do a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.980" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">that is maybe necessary in a giant world</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.600" end="00:14:46.500" style="s2">absolutely necessary and it&#39;s terrific</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.540" end="00:14:48.360" style="s2">assuming the foundation on which you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.730" end="00:14:56.090" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna take a little detour and steel</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.310" end="00:14:59.790" style="s2">man the gatekeeping okay I hate to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.090" end="00:15:02.700" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s the right thing so</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.790" end="00:15:05.310" style="s2">there is an argument that we need a kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.700" end="00:15:07.260" style="s2">of gatekeeping at the boundary where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.310" end="00:15:09.540" style="s2">take that which we think we know to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.260" end="00:15:12.600" style="s2">true and we try to enact it as some kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.540" end="00:15:15.510" style="s2">of policy obviously we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.600" end="00:15:17.880" style="s2">somebody empowered to say that idea is</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.510" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">not worth taking seriously if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.880" end="00:15:22.620" style="s2">figuring out how to allocate resources</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:24.510" style="s2">or what medicines are safe we have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.620" end="00:15:26.699" style="s2">have some kind of gatekeeping</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.510" end="00:15:28.290" style="s2">the problem is once you establish that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.699" end="00:15:31.550" style="s2">and it seems like gatekeeping is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.290" end="00:15:33.899" style="s2">keeps the world functional then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.550" end="00:15:35.820" style="s2">transported into the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.899" end="00:15:37.709" style="s2">science where it doesn&#39;t belong it just</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.820" end="00:15:40.050" style="s2">kind of gets grafted onto it and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.709" end="00:15:42.209" style="s2">used by people who have perverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.050" end="00:15:44.519" style="s2">incentives to shut down their</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.209" end="00:15:47.699" style="s2">competition which is both</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.519" end="00:15:50.430" style="s2">philosophically wrong and very bad for</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.699" end="00:15:52.050" style="s2">the world it results in us being farther</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.430" end="00:15:54.389" style="s2">behind in what we understand then we</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.050" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">would otherwise be so I was just about</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.389" end="00:15:57.630" style="s2">to add on and say this is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:01.620" style="s2">we see in peer review which seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.630" end="00:16:06.180" style="s2">good a good proposal but became so mired</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.620" end="00:16:08.459" style="s2">in its own internal perverse incentives</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.180" end="00:16:11.190" style="s2">that it is really hard to trust but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.459" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">was reminded before I began saying that</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.190" end="00:16:16.110" style="s2">that you were trying to steal man the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:18.180" style="s2">idea of gatekeeping and I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.110" end="00:16:19.860" style="s2">totally heard the steal man know that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.180" end="00:16:22.860" style="s2">need it when we get to what are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.860" end="00:16:27.660" style="s2">do okay what is correct we don&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.860" end="00:16:29.250" style="s2">and I would say when I hear it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.660" end="00:16:30.899" style="s2">point at which you take what we think we</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.250" end="00:16:33.000" style="s2">understand and you know it&#39;s imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.899" end="00:16:34.740" style="s2">but you have to translate it into policy</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.000" end="00:16:37.589" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of gatekeeping</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.740" end="00:16:39.149" style="s2">necessary there and you know I do not</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.589" end="00:16:41.639" style="s2">like gatekeepers and I think they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.149" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">become so corrupt that I just I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.639" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">defending anybody who holds the position</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:49.050" style="s2">of gatekeeper but I am saying in</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:51.449" style="s2">principle what I want is some standard</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.050" end="00:16:53.730" style="s2">by which we figure out how to translate</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.449" end="00:16:56.610" style="s2">what we think we understand into policy</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.730" end="00:17:00.029" style="s2">that eliminates some of the hazard that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.610" end="00:17:01.860" style="s2">would otherwise accompany that step and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.029" end="00:17:03.660" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea there that the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.860" end="00:17:05.939" style="s2">between the people who have figured it</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.660" end="00:17:08.579" style="s2">out as if who figured out what is true</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.939" end="00:17:11.939" style="s2">and the people who think they know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.579" end="00:17:15.540" style="s2">to do about that truth is typically so</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.939" end="00:17:17.429" style="s2">deep such a big chasm that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.540" end="00:17:19.829" style="s2">few people who can actually interpret in</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.429" end="00:17:22.370" style="s2">both worlds like what why is that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.829" end="00:17:25.470" style="s2">moment that gatekeeping you think is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.370" end="00:17:27.059" style="s2">maybe most easily defended as necessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.470" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">as opposed to the various other moments</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.059" end="00:17:32.850" style="s2">well I mean you know to take a trivial</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:37.380" style="s2">example there is some hazard that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.850" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">from the update process and us theorists</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.380" end="00:17:42.899" style="s2">must pay no attention to it all right it</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2">is a non-factor right the objective of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.899" end="00:17:48.019" style="s2">the exercise is to figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.000" end="00:17:51.029" style="s2">right and how you&#39;re gonna establish it</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.019" end="00:17:53.399" style="s2">but that is not the same thing as trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.029" end="00:17:55.289" style="s2">to you know make a Planet function and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.399" end="00:17:57.289" style="s2">prevent harm to people and things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.289" end="00:18:02.340" style="s2">that so you have to have some mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.289" end="00:18:03.630" style="s2">that isn&#39;t you know your policy isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.340" end="00:18:05.879" style="s2">gonna change on a dime the day you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.630" end="00:18:07.710" style="s2">realize that something you thought was</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.879" end="00:18:12.179" style="s2">this way is actually that way you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.710" end="00:18:14.039" style="s2">to have some coherent practical policy</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.179" end="00:18:17.159" style="s2">now again I hear myself defending</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.039" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">something I absolutely detest the end</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.159" end="00:18:21.809" style="s2">use of this process and you know you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">an extraordinary example of someone who</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.809" end="00:18:26.970" style="s2">does do both of these things and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:28.830" style="s2">know perhaps that&#39;s the reason for some</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.970" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">of the criticism that comes down the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.830" end="00:18:32.669" style="s2">pike at you in particular which is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:34.649" style="s2">no you do this thing but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.669" end="00:18:37.289" style="s2">all very much of the tunur of stay in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.649" end="00:18:39.720" style="s2">your lane we know what you do you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.289" end="00:18:41.850" style="s2">get out of get out of our space and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.720" end="00:18:47.279" style="s2">its territorial it&#39;s it&#39;s pissing on</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.850" end="00:18:50.399" style="s2">boundaries all of this so what how do</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.279" end="00:18:53.580" style="s2">you maintain that gatekeeping which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.399" end="00:18:55.980" style="s2">necessary while still allowing those who</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.580" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">can who have the chops to and who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.980" end="00:19:00.659" style="s2">willing to transgress boundaries that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">most people can&#39;t transgress all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.659" end="00:19:05.159" style="s2">two things the answer to your question</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:07.470" style="s2">comes down to a principle that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.159" end="00:19:10.399" style="s2">advocated to students for you know a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.470" end="00:19:14.159" style="s2">decade and a half mm-hmm which is it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.399" end="00:19:16.649" style="s2">natural for your science to affect your</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.159" end="00:19:18.059" style="s2">ideology write what you know to be true</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.649" end="00:19:19.860" style="s2">will certainly affect what you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.059" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">ought to happen it is completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.860" end="00:19:24.090" style="s2">unacceptable for your ideology to affect</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:26.759" style="s2">your science that is to say your</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.090" end="00:19:28.620" style="s2">ideology doesn&#39;t change what is true at</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.759" end="00:19:32.669" style="s2">all nor can it be allowed to so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.620" end="00:19:33.960" style="s2">one-way relationship so asterisk you had</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.669" end="00:19:36.179" style="s2">a second thing yeah I have something to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.960" end="00:19:37.980" style="s2">say in response to that okay the second</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.179" end="00:19:40.529" style="s2">thing I wanted to say is when I hear the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.980" end="00:19:42.110" style="s2">word peer review now I have the sense</p>

<p begin="00:19:42.110" end="00:19:48.779" style="s2">analogous to the Patriot Act right</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.440" end="00:19:51.779" style="s2">duck is a desperately unpatriotic</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.870" end="00:20:03.269" style="s2">can&#39;t be very good no I want my peers to</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.269" end="00:20:07.980" style="s2">do it in public and I want them to show</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.970" end="00:20:10.860" style="s2">their work so that if they turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.980" end="00:20:12.509" style="s2">be wrong then the credit flows the right</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.720" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">happen out in the open because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.940" end="00:20:21.330" style="s2">what happens is people abuse this</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:26.850" style="s2">process to shut down their competitors</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.330" end="00:20:28.259" style="s2">that&#39;s right so that was the the second</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.850" end="00:20:32.039" style="s2">piece that we shouldn&#39;t be misled it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.259" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">just like data-driven data-driven sounds</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.039" end="00:20:36.809" style="s2">like a it sounds like a defensive</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.039" end="00:20:38.730" style="s2">empiricism and who could possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.809" end="00:20:41.399" style="s2">against empiricism but that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.730" end="00:20:44.190" style="s2">it is it&#39;s data-driven yeah data is</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.399" end="00:20:45.720" style="s2">driven is hidden behind the word data so</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.190" end="00:20:47.250" style="s2">people will think that all you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.720" end="00:20:49.080" style="s2">is saying something obvious that every</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.350" end="00:21:00.029" style="s2">just this endless cycle of observation</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.720" end="00:21:01.470" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s you know you could without</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.029" end="00:21:03.539" style="s2">changing the meaning at all and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.470" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t clue too many people off to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.539" end="00:21:07.799" style="s2">what was coming on but you could instead</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:09.750" style="s2">of saying driven say first data first</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.799" end="00:21:11.850" style="s2">versus hypothesis first do you want your</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.750" end="00:21:14.190" style="s2">science to engage hypotheses first or</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.850" end="00:21:15.929" style="s2">data first and if it&#39;s data first you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.190" end="00:21:17.879" style="s2">got a problem because you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.929" end="00:21:18.990" style="s2">through many more iterative processes</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.879" end="00:21:20.610" style="s2">before you&#39;ve actually tested a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.990" end="00:21:22.590" style="s2">hypothesis and since most the science</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.610" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do that you actually don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.590" end="00:21:27.000" style="s2">a full cycle of the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:31.649" style="s2">with regard to your first point you had</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.000" end="00:21:34.440" style="s2">said it is unambiguously clear that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.649" end="00:21:36.330" style="s2">humans being humans as they do science</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.440" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">will find as they learn things through</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.330" end="00:21:40.649" style="s2">their science that their worldview is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.580" end="00:21:43.799" style="s2">affected by what they have learned but</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.649" end="00:21:45.960" style="s2">what we cannot have is that that process</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.799" end="00:21:48.659" style="s2">going the other direction which is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.960" end="00:21:53.250" style="s2">say we cannot have ideologies affecting</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.659" end="00:21:56.940" style="s2">science and this this reminded me of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.250" end="00:21:59.580" style="s2">know the objection yes this gets deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.940" end="00:22:00.510" style="s2">modernly political very quickly but you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.580" end="00:22:04.620" style="s2">know the</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.390" end="00:22:11.400" style="s2">many some good faith academics and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:13.500" style="s2">thinkers who are making cries for</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.400" end="00:22:14.940" style="s2">greater diversity in science for</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.500" end="00:22:16.260" style="s2">instance and you know the easy one to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.940" end="00:22:18.180" style="s2">to because we&#39;ve both thought about a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.260" end="00:22:19.650" style="s2">lot and talked about it a lot is we need</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.180" end="00:22:21.330" style="s2">more women in stem all right we need</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.650" end="00:22:25.560" style="s2">more women participating in science</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.330" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">technology engineering and math and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.560" end="00:22:28.980" style="s2">know this is this is not the place to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:30.330" style="s2">into all of the ways that the that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.980" end="00:22:33.480" style="s2">statistics that are usually trotted out</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.330" end="00:22:34.980" style="s2">here are often misleading and the goals</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.480" end="00:22:36.300" style="s2">that people are advocating for are</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.980" end="00:22:40.650" style="s2">probably not the goals that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.300" end="00:22:44.190" style="s2">shooting for but I remember saying to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.650" end="00:22:47.010" style="s2">number of earnest smart but frankly</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.190" end="00:22:48.750" style="s2">confused young mostly women but some men</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.010" end="00:22:50.190" style="s2">at a conference that we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.750" end="00:22:52.410" style="s2">participating in actually in the summer</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.190" end="00:22:54.210" style="s2">of 2017 after Evergreen had blown up</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.410" end="00:22:58.650" style="s2">before we knew that we weren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.210" end="00:23:00.360" style="s2">be faculty there anymore when when they</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.650" end="00:23:02.010" style="s2">were asking me when we had opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.360" end="00:23:03.720" style="s2">to get up and talk about what is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.010" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">nature of sex and gender the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.720" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">of sex and gender actually and what does</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:12.510" style="s2">it mean about proclivities and abilities</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:14.340" style="s2">and desires and all of this I said what</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.510" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">who you are what your particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.340" end="00:23:19.560" style="s2">demographic is should have absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.660" style="s2">effect at all on the results that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.560" end="00:23:23.550" style="s2">get if you are doing good science it</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.660" end="00:23:25.650" style="s2">should have no effect at all and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.550" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">therefore in that regard with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.650" end="00:23:30.690" style="s2">if scientists are just being handed</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:32.610" style="s2">questions to address then the particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.690" end="00:23:34.680" style="s2">answers the answers that are coming out</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.610" end="00:23:36.660" style="s2">of those scientific questions should not</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.680" end="00:23:38.610" style="s2">vary based on where those people are</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.610" end="00:23:42.120" style="s2">are how old they are with this issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.110" end="00:23:43.800" style="s2">economic background is any of that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.120" end="00:23:45.930" style="s2">that&#39;s of course a perfect world and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.800" end="00:23:47.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not exactly totally true but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.930" end="00:23:50.900" style="s2">fact is a scientific process</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.210" end="00:23:54.630" style="s2">specifically is you know is about</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.900" end="00:23:56.010" style="s2">extracting the bias of the human doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.630" end="00:23:57.300" style="s2">the work such that you can get to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.010" end="00:24:01.290" style="s2">result that would be true no matter who</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.300" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">you are but what isn&#39;t the same is what</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.290" end="00:24:05.460" style="s2">questions you choose to ask so the place</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:08.370" style="s2">where diversity diversity to use you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.460" end="00:24:10.620" style="s2">know it&#39;s super nuanced and politicized</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.370" end="00:24:12.740" style="s2">term now but the place where we the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.620" end="00:24:15.170" style="s2">reason that we actually do want</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.740" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">a more diverse pool of people doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.170" end="00:24:20.150" style="s2">science and asking questions across all</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:21.350" style="s2">domains is that your particular history</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.309" end="00:24:33.500" style="s2">ask are of course part of the purview of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.230" end="00:24:34.940" style="s2">what you do as a scientist so diversity</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.500" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter at all for the results</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.940" end="00:24:37.820" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t matter for the questions</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.370" end="00:24:44.870" style="s2">for the kinds of corruptions mental and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.010" end="00:24:46.820" style="s2">otherwise that enter into the process so</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.870" end="00:24:49.160" style="s2">we are gonna have to get back to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.820" end="00:24:54.380" style="s2">basic structure here no no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.160" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">somewhere so important though and I will</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.380" end="00:24:58.580" style="s2">say I do think there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.920" style="s2">questions and this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.580" end="00:25:02.290" style="s2">considerations of empathy and who you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.920" end="00:25:06.110" style="s2">will have an easier time understanding</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.290" end="00:25:10.850" style="s2">yeah there are places where I do think</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.110" end="00:25:12.910" style="s2">our field has actually wildly up</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.850" end="00:25:15.830" style="s2">not to put too fine a point on it</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.910" end="00:25:17.240" style="s2">because for historical reasons that have</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.830" end="00:25:19.910" style="s2">nothing to do with this field in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.240" end="00:25:22.700" style="s2">particular it was historically done by</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.910" end="00:25:25.309" style="s2">men and so what it discovered the order</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.700" end="00:25:28.280" style="s2">of things that discovered had a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.309" end="00:25:29.900" style="s2">do with what males are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.280" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">see and what they&#39;re more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.900" end="00:25:37.370" style="s2">unable to see and so my favorite example</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:39.230" style="s2">of this is Jane Goodall who the great</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.370" end="00:25:41.570" style="s2">hero of mine I know of yours as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.230" end="00:25:44.630" style="s2">saw her video this week actually was</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.570" end="00:25:46.460" style="s2">great to see she&#39;s usually travels all</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.630" end="00:25:48.530" style="s2">the time but under lockdown she had time</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.460" end="00:25:52.520" style="s2">to make a video I think that defending</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.530" end="00:25:57.860" style="s2">bats wonderful thank you Jane but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.520" end="00:26:00.140" style="s2">I think Jane Goodall cracked the code of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.860" end="00:26:02.210" style="s2">the great apes where men had failed</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.330" end="00:26:54.210" style="s2">well and you know the key thing that she</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.720" end="00:26:55.680" style="s2">did was ingratiate ourselves to her</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.210" end="00:26:57.630" style="s2">study organism so that they would ignore</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.680" end="00:26:59.490" style="s2">her enough that she could understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.630" end="00:27:02.340" style="s2">what they were up to which you know came</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.490" end="00:27:04.140" style="s2">an absolutely necessary part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.340" end="00:27:06.630" style="s2">study of social behavior of anything</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.140" end="00:27:07.800" style="s2">that is in any way conscious you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.630" end="00:27:09.180" style="s2">you don&#39;t I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t particularly</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.800" end="00:27:11.400" style="s2">need to ingratiate myself with my frogs</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.180" end="00:27:13.650" style="s2">they they would fall on me from trees no</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.400" end="00:27:15.450" style="s2">matter what and ignore me mostly but if</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.650" end="00:27:17.160" style="s2">you&#39;re studying you know dolphins or</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.450" end="00:27:19.740" style="s2">elephants or chimps or any primates</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.160" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">really or crows or you know a number a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.740" end="00:27:24.570" style="s2">number of organisms and you would need</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.210" end="00:27:27.300" style="s2">to and was it was it Leakey I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.570" end="00:27:30.810" style="s2">remember now which big name in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.300" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">anthropology tapped not just Goodall was</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.810" end="00:27:35.400" style="s2">leaking so it was Louis Leakey you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:37.620" style="s2">just just to add a little bit more meat</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.400" end="00:27:38.940" style="s2">to this story yeah Louis Leakey who is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.620" end="00:27:41.580" style="s2">this you know big old man in</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.940" end="00:27:43.770" style="s2">anthropology says what we really need in</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.580" end="00:27:46.890" style="s2">order to understand human origins and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.770" end="00:27:48.900" style="s2">human behavior is a is a better grasp of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.890" end="00:27:50.700" style="s2">what is going on with the at that point</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.900" end="00:27:52.710" style="s2">we thought three extant species of great</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.700" end="00:27:55.260" style="s2">apes bonobos were classified as a small</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.710" end="00:27:57.060" style="s2">species of chimp so he didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.260" end="00:27:59.160" style="s2">people going after the bonobos but he</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.060" end="00:28:01.500" style="s2">said I&#39;m gonna find three people who I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.160" end="00:28:04.710" style="s2">can send to the field for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.500" end="00:28:07.650" style="s2">and see if they can&#39;t crack you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.710" end="00:28:10.980" style="s2">crack the code so to speak of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.650" end="00:28:14.040" style="s2">these that chimps gorillas and an</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.980" end="00:28:16.950" style="s2">orangutans are doing and he was quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.040" end="00:28:18.780" style="s2">explicit about choosing three women he</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.950" end="00:28:20.460" style="s2">chose Jane cuddle Goodall for the chimps</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.780" end="00:28:22.800" style="s2">Dian Fossey for the gorillas and beretta</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.460" end="00:28:24.210" style="s2">galdikas for the orangutans galdikas</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.800" end="00:28:27.720" style="s2">says I believe still working in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.210" end="00:28:32.029" style="s2">field and Fauci obviously was killed by</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.720" end="00:28:35.419" style="s2">poachers and and and Goodall has become</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.029" end="00:28:38.149" style="s2">and massively important cultural figure</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.419" end="00:28:39.590" style="s2">and and probably has helped save not</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.149" end="00:28:42.379" style="s2">just many chimps but many other</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.590" end="00:28:45.859" style="s2">organisms throughout her work and his</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.379" end="00:28:47.299" style="s2">Leakey&#39;s position was not just okay but</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.859" end="00:28:49.820" style="s2">the men have been trying and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.299" end="00:28:52.789" style="s2">getting anywhere but I leak II actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.820" end="00:28:55.669" style="s2">think that there is there was a chance</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.789" end="00:28:58.249" style="s2">that women actually have more empathy</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.669" end="00:29:00.169" style="s2">and are going to be better able to put</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.249" end="00:29:02.019" style="s2">themselves to basically do the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.169" end="00:29:04.820" style="s2">mind trick and imagine what it is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.019" end="00:29:07.789" style="s2">to be a chimp a gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.820" end="00:29:09.649" style="s2">an orangutan and therefore get somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.789" end="00:29:11.389" style="s2">it would be studies and of course all</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.649" end="00:29:13.969" style="s2">three of those women were trailblazing</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.389" end="00:29:16.639" style="s2">and we really we know much more than we</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.969" end="00:29:17.960" style="s2">would have had their bet had they been</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.639" end="00:29:20.899" style="s2">any other individuals including most</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.960" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">women right but that there is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.899" end="00:29:27.469" style="s2">of work that the particular propensity</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:29.719" style="s2">is and proclivities on average of men</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.469" end="00:29:33.859" style="s2">versus women may make one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.719" end="00:29:36.099" style="s2">more suited to that work yeah so and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.859" end="00:29:40.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s interesting that the story is</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.099" end="00:29:43.009" style="s2">that you know the grand old man of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.210" end="00:29:44.599" style="s2">paleontology sent these women to do this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.009" end="00:29:46.539" style="s2">work because he understood that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.599" end="00:29:49.580" style="s2">would get it better and I think history</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.539" end="00:29:52.489" style="s2">bore out his suspicions so anyway it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.580" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a complex story I would say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.489" end="00:29:58.269" style="s2">one other place that I think our field</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:30:01.070" style="s2">has screwed up as a result of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.269" end="00:30:03.129" style="s2">male cognitive bias that&#39;s blinded us</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.070" end="00:30:06.830" style="s2">and it has to do with our</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.129" end="00:30:09.139" style="s2">misunderstanding of male sexual displays</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.830" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">and lekking species and that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.139" end="00:30:15.529" style="s2">way in which men who don&#39;t entirely get</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:17.899" style="s2">women have looked at the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.529" end="00:30:19.489" style="s2">females in many species require males to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.899" end="00:30:21.589" style="s2">do these elaborate seemingly senseless</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.489" end="00:30:25.429" style="s2">things and they&#39;re you know they had</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.589" end="00:30:28.700" style="s2">kind of a you know female suit against a</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.429" end="00:30:32.269" style="s2">reaction and anyway I think had the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.700" end="00:30:35.029" style="s2">field incorporated women more quickly we</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.269" end="00:30:36.499" style="s2">might have fixed this one sooner so one</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.029" end="00:30:37.999" style="s2">more anecdote here before you get back</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.499" end="00:30:39.710" style="s2">on let me say I do think we have the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.999" end="00:30:42.349" style="s2">answer to that puzzle and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.710" end="00:30:44.820" style="s2">here it&#39;s going to emerge and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.349" end="00:30:47.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a fully satisfying very</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.820" end="00:30:49.230" style="s2">the answer but what would relax about</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.100" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">anyway yeah what why why does the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.230" end="00:30:52.850" style="s2">peacock have such a fancy tail we know</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:55.230" style="s2">why he has it</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.850" end="00:30:56.610" style="s2">females require it but why do the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.230" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">females require it that&#39;s the tough part</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.610" end="00:31:03.899" style="s2">yeah so the anecdote is you know animal</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:06.120" style="s2">behavior and especially the study of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.899" end="00:31:07.769" style="s2">social behavior was of course biased</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.120" end="00:31:09.179" style="s2">towards mostly males doing it for a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.769" end="00:31:11.100" style="s2">long time just because of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.179" end="00:31:14.130" style="s2">history of science and how and how work</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.100" end="00:31:17.370" style="s2">of any sort really outside of the home</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.130" end="00:31:19.409" style="s2">has been done in humans and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.370" end="00:31:21.629" style="s2">book by Sarah bluffer hurdy who is I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.409" end="00:31:23.549" style="s2">don&#39;t know she are academic so sibling</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.629" end="00:31:25.860" style="s2">yeah so she was a student she was an</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.549" end="00:31:29.480" style="s2">early student of Dick Alexander&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.860" end="00:31:31.769" style="s2">so right boomers she was oh yeah she was</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.480" end="00:31:33.990" style="s2">she was a when she was an undergrad when</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.769" end="00:31:36.409" style="s2">he was a graduate student okay so Sarah</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.990" end="00:31:39.659" style="s2">black for her tea is an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.409" end="00:31:42.509" style="s2">researchers who worked on worked in</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.659" end="00:31:44.580" style="s2">India on langars and has written a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.509" end="00:31:46.409" style="s2">number of excellent books including</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.580" end="00:31:47.789" style="s2">mother nature which has different</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.409" end="00:31:49.470" style="s2">subtitles depending on when and where it</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.789" end="00:31:53.070" style="s2">was published but it is such an</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:55.980" style="s2">excellent investigation of the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.070" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">social behavior in mostly primates</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.980" end="00:32:00.929" style="s2">including humans that it was and I you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:02.490" style="s2">know we&#39;ve talked before about neither</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.929" end="00:32:04.409" style="s2">of us really ever liked to use text</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.490" end="00:32:05.789" style="s2">books so this was one of the key books</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.409" end="00:32:09.299" style="s2">that I would use in my animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.789" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">programs and it is mostly an</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.299" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">investigation of social behavior through</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:14.940" style="s2">a female lens it&#39;s about mothers and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:16.470" style="s2">daughters and how fathers come into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.940" end="00:32:17.909" style="s2">picture and in pair bonded species how</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.470" end="00:32:19.259" style="s2">important they are in a non pair bonded</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.909" end="00:32:21.899" style="s2">species how the females have to defend</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.259" end="00:32:24.539" style="s2">against you know putative fathers and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.899" end="00:32:27.480" style="s2">would-be would-be intruders and all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.539" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">this and at the end of I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.480" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">the first time I taught a nobody if</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:34.110" style="s2">you&#39;re using this as one of my books</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:36.659" style="s2">that we seminar Don every week</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.110" end="00:32:38.340" style="s2">I remember hearing some it was good</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.340" end="00:32:42.059" style="s2">criticism but some sort of grumbling on</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.710" end="00:32:44.549" style="s2">a field trip from some of my male</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.059" end="00:32:46.590" style="s2">students that they hadn&#39;t had any idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.549" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">that the field of animal behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:52.169" style="s2">the study of sexual selection was such a</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">female biased field I thought oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.169" end="00:32:55.230" style="s2">I had no idea that that could be an</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">interpretation but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.230" end="00:32:58.710" style="s2">inadvertently I just I just flipped the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:00.450" style="s2">expectations</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.710" end="00:33:02.039" style="s2">they&#39;re ahead because no one I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.450" end="00:33:03.779" style="s2">think in the history of the study of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.039" end="00:33:06.120" style="s2">animal behavior had ever before voiced</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.779" end="00:33:07.590" style="s2">the concern but it was two female bias</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.120" end="00:33:10.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s really just you know which</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.590" end="00:33:12.510" style="s2">which stories and written by home do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.230" end="00:33:15.029" style="s2">run into first and yes if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.510" end="00:33:16.919" style="s2">studying social behavior you really do</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.029" end="00:33:18.630" style="s2">need both men and women doing it if</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.919" end="00:33:20.570" style="s2">you&#39;re studying quirks it&#39;s not clear to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.630" end="00:33:22.919" style="s2">me that you do and if you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.570" end="00:33:24.630" style="s2">you know medical procedures it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.919" end="00:33:26.730" style="s2">clear to me that you do although medical</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.630" end="00:33:28.169" style="s2">procedures need to be done on both men</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.730" end="00:33:29.700" style="s2">and women because men and women have</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.169" end="00:33:31.049" style="s2">fundamentally different anatomies and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.700" end="00:33:34.820" style="s2">physiologies and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.049" end="00:33:38.730" style="s2">um and it&#39;s also worth pointing out that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.820" end="00:33:41.909" style="s2">our era the era in which we studied in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.730" end="00:33:44.100" style="s2">graduate school the our mentors were all</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.909" end="00:33:51.899" style="s2">of a generation that they could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.100" end="00:33:53.370" style="s2">forgiven for a certain view of women you</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.899" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">know a throwback view but none of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.370" end="00:33:57.690" style="s2">people who mentored us had that view</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:34:00.990" style="s2">they were all very farsighted like her</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.690" end="00:34:03.419" style="s2">dad was and had excellent female</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.990" end="00:34:05.130" style="s2">students that they produced because they</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.419" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">had no such bias so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.130" end="00:34:12.030" style="s2">kudos to Arno Kluge and dick Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:14.369" style="s2">and Bob Traverse all of these men were</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.030" end="00:34:17.310" style="s2">ahead of their time with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.369" end="00:34:20.520" style="s2">understanding how broken that particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.310" end="00:34:21.810" style="s2">chauvinism was just just not caring they</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.520" end="00:34:23.639" style="s2">didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t have alleged female</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.810" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">students didn&#39;t seek out female students</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.639" end="00:34:26.909" style="s2">I didn&#39;t give you out the job right you</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:28.349" style="s2">got you know can you can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.909" end="00:34:30.119" style="s2">science can you know can you generate</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.349" end="00:34:31.800" style="s2">hypotheses and experiments and all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.119" end="00:34:32.760" style="s2">these things and if you can&#39;t I really</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.800" end="00:34:34.230" style="s2">don&#39;t have the time for you and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.760" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">gonna be gentle on you because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.230" end="00:34:37.050" style="s2">female and I&#39;m afraid you might cry or</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:39.419" style="s2">something you don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.050" end="00:34:40.889" style="s2">that&#39;s chauvinism to and none of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.419" end="00:34:43.970" style="s2">engaged in that either not in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.889" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">slightest all right so let us some</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.970" end="00:34:48.510" style="s2">return to the meat of the map yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:51.139" style="s2">theorists do not create theories they</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.510" end="00:34:55.020" style="s2">cannot what theorists do is they advance</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.139" end="00:35:00.170" style="s2">hypotheses and those hypotheses if they</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.020" end="00:35:02.820" style="s2">survive test and ultimately go on to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.170" end="00:35:03.960" style="s2">the default assumption of the field that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.820" end="00:35:05.810" style="s2">is the moment at which they become</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.960" end="00:35:08.460" style="s2">theories so I think the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.810" end="00:35:10.500" style="s2">the reason that this is so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.460" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">connected to the meaning-making crisis</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.500" end="00:35:15.380" style="s2">and the possum</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:18.640" style="s2">route out of it is that that process</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.380" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">whereby you take a minority perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:25.070" style="s2">you demonstrate its importance and it</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:28.790" style="s2">replaces the dominant paradigm this is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.070" end="00:35:32.420" style="s2">rigorous mechanism whereby heterodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.790" end="00:35:34.010" style="s2">becomes the new orthodoxy and orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.420" end="00:35:36.650" style="s2">has this bad connotation but in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.010" end="00:35:39.170" style="s2">case what I simply mean is it is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.650" end="00:35:41.060" style="s2">standing of what we commonly believed to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.170" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">be true you know that the earth goes</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.060" end="00:35:47.120" style="s2">around the Sun is now orthodoxy as it</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:49.670" style="s2">should be it&#39;s almost certainly correct</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.120" end="00:35:52.340" style="s2">how did it get there well it started as</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.670" end="00:35:54.830" style="s2">a minority perspective that had to win</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.340" end="00:35:57.080" style="s2">the day through this process so to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.830" end="00:36:00.230" style="s2">the process a little clearer just</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.080" end="00:36:02.570" style="s2">realize that mathematics has an analogue</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.230" end="00:36:05.390" style="s2">of this whole thing and the terms are</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.570" end="00:36:07.370" style="s2">different but the logic is very similar</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.390" end="00:36:09.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not identical but it&#39;s very similar</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.370" end="00:36:12.530" style="s2">so in mathematics you can offer a</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.830" end="00:36:16.130" style="s2">conjecture that&#39;s a proposal that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.530" end="00:36:19.870" style="s2">equivalent of a hypothesis you can offer</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.130" end="00:36:25.000" style="s2">a proof of the conjecture a proof is</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.870" end="00:36:29.030" style="s2">analogous to a hypothesis test and if a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.000" end="00:36:31.670" style="s2">conjecture is proven then it becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.030" end="00:36:33.770" style="s2">axiom and what an axiom is is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.670" end="00:36:36.140" style="s2">default assumption for what is true it</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.770" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">has become axiomatic so in science</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.140" end="00:36:40.580" style="s2">instead of doing those things again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:46.310" style="s2">not exactly the same but it&#39;s close you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.580" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">observe a pattern you hypothesize an</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.310" end="00:36:50.630" style="s2">explanation for the pattern the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:53.300" style="s2">hypothesis is effectively a conjecture</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.630" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">that comes along with predictions and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.300" end="00:36:57.710" style="s2">then those predictions allow you to test</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:37:00.530" style="s2">the hypothesis and see whether in fact</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.710" end="00:37:02.600" style="s2">it stands up to that rigorous challenge</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.530" end="00:37:04.910" style="s2">at the point that something has stood up</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.600" end="00:37:06.920" style="s2">to enough challenge that the default</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.910" end="00:37:09.290" style="s2">assumption of the field is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.920" end="00:37:11.780" style="s2">true then it is a theory and so this</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.290" end="00:37:13.490" style="s2">explains the mysterious conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.780" end="00:37:15.740" style="s2">that we hear so many times where people</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.490" end="00:37:19.100" style="s2">allege that Darwinism is just a theory</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.740" end="00:37:20.540" style="s2">and that that means that other theories</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.100" end="00:37:22.550" style="s2">should be taught alongside if that is in</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.540" end="00:37:24.440" style="s2">fact a non sequitur because there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.550" end="00:37:25.850" style="s2">other theories there is only one theory</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.440" end="00:37:28.520" style="s2">of how life became</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.850" end="00:37:30.410" style="s2">complex on earth and it is Darwinian in</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.520" end="00:37:32.270" style="s2">one form or another so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.410" end="00:37:33.470" style="s2">reiterate what you just said in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.270" end="00:37:35.120" style="s2">slightly different order because I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.470" end="00:37:39.620" style="s2">it&#39;s important and it bears repeating a</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.120" end="00:37:41.330" style="s2">few times scientists a hypothesis as</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.620" end="00:37:43.400" style="s2">Malthus - conjecture</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.330" end="00:37:45.470" style="s2">so I father says conjecture are the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.400" end="00:37:48.530" style="s2">thing in science I&#39;m out space science</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.470" end="00:37:51.110" style="s2">is to test as math is to proof right</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.530" end="00:37:54.530" style="s2">testing in science is like the proofs in</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.110" end="00:37:56.900" style="s2">in math and science is to theory as math</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.530" end="00:38:00.350" style="s2">is to axiom and I think you&#39;ve also said</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.900" end="00:38:02.510" style="s2">more postulate or theorem in math right</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.350" end="00:38:04.520" style="s2">so science has hypothesis and testing</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.510" end="00:38:06.710" style="s2">theory and math has conjecture proof and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.520" end="00:38:09.620" style="s2">axiom also postulates and theorems and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.710" end="00:38:13.130" style="s2">that those are you know more or less</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.620" end="00:38:15.590" style="s2">analogous points with one important</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.130" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">caveat distinction between theory and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.590" end="00:38:20.690" style="s2">science and axiom in math which so to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:22.100" style="s2">get to I&#39;m I&#39;m a little out of my depth</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.690" end="00:38:25.190" style="s2">here I&#39;m really not a mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.100" end="00:38:28.790" style="s2">although obviously there&#39;s math in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.190" end="00:38:32.300" style="s2">family very close by but the difference</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.790" end="00:38:35.300" style="s2">I think is that when a conjecture has</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.300" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">been has a proof has been delivered that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.300" end="00:38:41.420" style="s2">has withstood scrutiny I believe it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:44.090" style="s2">accurate to say that the axiom that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.420" end="00:38:45.650" style="s2">arises is simply true and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.090" end="00:38:48.350" style="s2">to worry about it being falsified</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.650" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">because the nature of proof is such that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.350" end="00:38:53.290" style="s2">proof isn&#39;t like a big stack of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:55.370" style="s2">that something is right it&#39;s an ironclad</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.290" end="00:38:57.350" style="s2">demonstration that it is right and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.370" end="00:39:00.680" style="s2">once something has reached the status of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.350" end="00:39:05.750" style="s2">axiom is it beyond disproof I suspect it</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.680" end="00:39:09.350" style="s2">is so that&#39;s different than in science</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.750" end="00:39:12.620" style="s2">where a theory Darwinism could be false</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.350" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">let&#39;s say for example we are living in a</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.150" style="s2">into it or the appearance of Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.500" end="00:39:22.940" style="s2">was hard-coded into it in order to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.150" end="00:39:25.250" style="s2">figure out you know what we humans would</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.940" end="00:39:28.700" style="s2">think in response to it then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.250" end="00:39:32.210" style="s2">real and the appearance that it is real</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.700" end="00:39:35.120" style="s2">is explainable by a larger hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.210" end="00:39:37.250" style="s2">which could be potentially demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.120" end="00:39:38.840" style="s2">but nonetheless it could be false and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.250" end="00:39:39.450" style="s2">could discover it but at the moment we</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.840" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">have no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.450" end="00:39:42.540" style="s2">think that&#39;s coming any more than we</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:44.250" style="s2">have reason to think that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.540" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">discover that the earth doesn&#39;t orbit</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.250" end="00:39:49.860" style="s2">around the Sun one of the distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">at least in the realm of science that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.860" end="00:39:55.230" style="s2">often engage in is also the test is as</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:58.140" style="s2">you said basically based on a stack of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.230" end="00:40:00.210" style="s2">evidence that then endures basically a</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.140" end="00:40:02.430" style="s2">probabilistic assessment statistics is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.210" end="00:40:05.640" style="s2">probabilistic assessment and because</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.430" end="00:40:07.860" style="s2">it&#39;s probabilistic the theory that may</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.640" end="00:40:11.210" style="s2">result after many many many tests in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.860" end="00:40:14.670" style="s2">end the test of time as it were is still</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.210" end="00:40:17.130" style="s2">based on probabilistic analysis whereas</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.670" end="00:40:20.610" style="s2">a proof is not generally probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.130" end="00:40:22.950" style="s2">it is it is yes or no Egypt this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.610" end="00:40:25.020" style="s2">either accurate or a proof from you the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.950" end="00:40:27.330" style="s2">steps have been binary and so there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.020" end="00:40:30.180" style="s2">it is not a probabilistic situation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.330" end="00:40:32.220" style="s2">right so one of the outgrowth of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.180" end="00:40:34.350" style="s2">that I think people who use the term</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.220" end="00:40:37.020" style="s2">theory casually don&#39;t understand is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.350" end="00:40:40.080" style="s2">there should really only be one theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.020" end="00:40:43.590" style="s2">for a given observation at a time the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.080" end="00:40:45.620" style="s2">theory is that which is so likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.590" end="00:40:48.360" style="s2">right that it is taken as the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.620" end="00:40:50.070" style="s2">and it can be displaced by some other</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.360" end="00:40:52.590" style="s2">theory but then it&#39;s no longer a theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.070" end="00:40:54.930" style="s2">it gets demoted to the status of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.590" end="00:40:59.130" style="s2">hypothesis and in fact it&#39;s a falsified</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:41:02.280" style="s2">hypothesis at that point so that is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.130" end="00:41:04.530" style="s2">important fact theory is not some</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.280" end="00:41:07.320" style="s2">infinitely large space it is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.530" end="00:41:08.550" style="s2">something you yourself produce it is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.320" end="00:41:10.140" style="s2">result of a combination of things</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.550" end="00:41:13.110" style="s2">actually it&#39;s a result of the exact</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.140" end="00:41:15.120" style="s2">combination of the team work that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.110" end="00:41:17.220" style="s2">were describing before right you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.120" end="00:41:19.230" style="s2">generate a hypothesis the empiricist</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.220" end="00:41:21.300" style="s2">tests it sometimes the empiricist is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.230" end="00:41:24.180" style="s2">also the theorist but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.300" end="00:41:26.850" style="s2">but the end product of the cycle is</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.180" end="00:41:29.640" style="s2">theory so why are we so confused about</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.850" end="00:41:33.360" style="s2">this this is the this is the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.640" end="00:41:35.250" style="s2">this is uh this is a difficult one to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.360" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">deal with because what we have just</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.250" end="00:41:39.420" style="s2">described is the way it is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.490" style="s2">function it very frequently doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.420" end="00:41:43.650" style="s2">function inside even inside of fields</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.490" end="00:41:46.110" style="s2">where we wield the term theory as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.650" end="00:41:47.970" style="s2">defense of for example Darwinism where</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.110" end="00:41:49.020" style="s2">we swear that the creationists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.970" end="00:41:51.420" style="s2">know what they&#39;re talking about because</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.020" end="00:41:52.650" style="s2">they say Darwinism is only a theory and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.420" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">we say you don&#39;t get what that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.650" end="00:41:57.089" style="s2">term means right even inside of a field</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:41:59.130" style="s2">where we need that defense</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.089" end="00:42:00.990" style="s2">we&#39;re not consistent about the use of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.130" end="00:42:04.890" style="s2">the term but there are other fields in</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.990" end="00:42:06.990" style="s2">which a much worse job is done and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.890" end="00:42:08.460" style="s2">think that this is the problem part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.990" end="00:42:11.190" style="s2">the crisis and meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.460" end="00:42:14.549" style="s2">has to do with the fact that there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.190" end="00:42:17.130" style="s2">even a standard between disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.549" end="00:42:19.470" style="s2">about how to use these terms so I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.130" end="00:42:23.339" style="s2">say the worst offenders in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.470" end="00:42:25.319" style="s2">outside of maybe the the humanities who</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.339" end="00:42:26.670" style="s2">abuse the term a theory like nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.319" end="00:42:29.430" style="s2">business and maybe we&#39;ll return to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.670" end="00:42:32.250" style="s2">but the worst offenders inside science I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.430" end="00:42:35.490" style="s2">would say are the physicists who very</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.250" end="00:42:37.260" style="s2">frequently when they talk talk as if</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.490" end="00:42:38.940" style="s2">they are advancing theories which</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.260" end="00:42:41.069" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense if you use the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.940" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">proper definition and this resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.069" end="00:42:46.799" style="s2">immense amount of confusion that frankly</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:49.260" style="s2">I think is hiding in broads in plain</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.799" end="00:42:52.020" style="s2">sight right I think anybody can see it</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.260" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s a hierarchy you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.020" end="00:42:56.279" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t a hypothesis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:57.630" style="s2">an idea it could be true but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.279" end="00:42:59.970" style="s2">know how to test it it doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.630" end="00:43:03.059" style="s2">obvious predictions okay that&#39;s a notion</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.970" end="00:43:05.579" style="s2">or interpretation okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.059" end="00:43:08.910" style="s2">necessarily wrong but it&#39;s below a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.579" end="00:43:10.260" style="s2">hypothesis a hypothesis is an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.910" end="00:43:12.809" style="s2">why something might be the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.260" end="00:43:16.589" style="s2">that comes with a prediction that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.809" end="00:43:18.839" style="s2">tell you if it was false right so it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.589" end="00:43:22.349" style="s2">a higher status because it comes along</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.839" end="00:43:24.299" style="s2">with something that gives it the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.349" end="00:43:26.549" style="s2">potential for being eliminated if it</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.299" end="00:43:27.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t true a conjecture doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.549" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">be you know we can conjecture that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.930" end="00:43:33.930" style="s2">is one of a you know a billion universes</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:37.650" style="s2">and that would have no implication for</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.930" end="00:43:39.809" style="s2">us here in the universe so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.650" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">can&#39;t say it&#39;s true or false but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.809" end="00:43:45.900" style="s2">not as good as a hypothesis and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:47.670" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you know a hypothesis that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.900" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">withstood test and if it withstands</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.670" end="00:43:51.210" style="s2">enough tests that it becomes the default</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:55.049" style="s2">assumption it becomes a theory right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.210" end="00:43:57.990" style="s2">that&#39;s the hierarchy you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.990" end="00:44:04.619" style="s2">you&#39;ve got theories which are hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.369" end="00:44:06.540" style="s2">that have become the default basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.619" end="00:44:09.270" style="s2">they have in a legal sense you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.540" end="00:44:11.490" style="s2">say they have the presumption of being</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.270" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">accurate and they are capable of being</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.490" end="00:44:18.150" style="s2">removed but until they are we just treat</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:19.980" style="s2">them effectively as axiomatic but what</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.150" end="00:44:23.250" style="s2">do we do with something like string</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.980" end="00:44:25.710" style="s2">theory why do we even call it string</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.710" end="00:44:33.240" style="s2">theory has yet to deliver a testable</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:36.750" style="s2">prediction now that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.240" end="00:44:38.580" style="s2">wrong but it does mean it&#39;s a notion or</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.580" end="00:44:45.780" style="s2">hypothesis and if we discussed string</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.710" end="00:44:50.850" style="s2">theory as string notion or you know then</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.780" end="00:44:53.130" style="s2">a little bit of its cachet as it should</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.850" end="00:44:56.670" style="s2">and you know again that doesn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.130" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">wrong but it doesn&#39;t deserve the status</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.670" end="00:45:01.800" style="s2">of theory the top level right the</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.850" end="00:45:11.490" style="s2">understand is that effectively string</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.610" end="00:45:13.770" style="s2">theory socially won the day people were</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.160" end="00:46:04.860" style="s2">there it is actually a response to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:08.370" style="s2">difficulty of the study of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.860" end="00:46:11.010" style="s2">and that&#39;s it it&#39;s some idea that would</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.370" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">just simply render it outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.010" end="00:46:15.270" style="s2">purview and therefore not our problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.960" end="00:46:17.010" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t take it seriously at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.270" end="00:46:19.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t see any reason anyone should but</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.010" end="00:46:20.190" style="s2">nonetheless it is talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.410" end="00:46:21.420" style="s2">serious</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.190" end="00:46:24.329" style="s2">circles as if it were something</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.420" end="00:46:25.950" style="s2">scientific when in fact it hasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.329" end="00:46:28.020" style="s2">hasn&#39;t even risen to the bottom rung of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.950" end="00:46:30.990" style="s2">the ladder so you&#39;ve got a category</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.020" end="00:46:34.380" style="s2">notions into which you&#39;ve currently put</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.990" end="00:46:36.420" style="s2">string theory and pants autism and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.380" end="00:46:39.319" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s a great bin to start</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.420" end="00:46:42.390" style="s2">filling with things that have been given</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.319" end="00:46:46.619" style="s2">probably more press and more importance</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.390" end="00:46:49.319" style="s2">than they would seem if for if only for</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.619" end="00:46:52.260" style="s2">the fact that no one pointed out not</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.319" end="00:46:54.210" style="s2">testable therefore couldn&#39;t possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.260" end="00:46:57.210" style="s2">a theory because not testable means not</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.210" end="00:46:59.940" style="s2">knowable and can&#39;t even be a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.210" end="00:47:01.770" style="s2">yeah and I should say I&#39;m violating one</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.940" end="00:47:04.440" style="s2">of my own rules here I know I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.770" end="00:47:05.730" style="s2">being a dick by condom notions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.440" end="00:47:07.829" style="s2">really just designed to annoy people</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.730" end="00:47:11.730" style="s2">okay maybe a new name for the bin well</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.829" end="00:47:16.710" style="s2">the bin has a name um its interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.730" end="00:47:18.450" style="s2">right so is it yeah I mean it is in</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.710" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">physics so at the Copenhagen</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.450" end="00:47:24.660" style="s2">interpretation Oh example so this again</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.369" style="s2">points to another one of these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.660" end="00:47:28.109" style="s2">that&#39;s artificially been boosted because</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.369" end="00:47:29.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a cool idea but it still hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.109" end="00:47:32.069" style="s2">reached the bottom rung which is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.400" end="00:47:35.210" style="s2">many-worlds interpretation right the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.069" end="00:47:39.690" style="s2">many-worlds interpretation is consistent</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.210" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">with you know events happening the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.690" end="00:47:45.720" style="s2">they seemed to or seem to this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:49.770" style="s2">emerging 100 ish years ago maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.720" end="00:47:54.470" style="s2">yes in response to you know but that</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.770" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">will slit experiment and the Schrodinger</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.470" end="00:47:59.250" style="s2">experiment or thought experiment but</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:48:02.609" style="s2">anyway the point is yes you can solve</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.250" end="00:48:04.560" style="s2">the puzzle by imagining an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.609" end="00:48:07.079" style="s2">number of universes springing off of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.560" end="00:48:09.930" style="s2">each other I think it&#39;s the worst idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.079" end="00:48:12.839" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever heard but but nonetheless I</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.930" end="00:48:16.530" style="s2">get that technically it&#39;s consistent</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.839" end="00:48:18.839" style="s2">with what we see but that doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.530" end="00:48:20.190" style="s2">isn&#39;t even the first level of saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:21.540" style="s2">okay it&#39;s consistent with what we see</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.190" end="00:48:23.250" style="s2">but you want to make it a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.540" end="00:48:26.369" style="s2">tell us what it predicts that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.250" end="00:48:29.339" style="s2">yet know to be true yeah right I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.369" end="00:48:32.130" style="s2">say likewise the in the interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.339" end="00:48:32.910" style="s2">that this is a deterministic universe or</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.130" end="00:48:34.980" style="s2">could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.910" end="00:48:36.540" style="s2">be a deterministic universe if the point</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.980" end="00:48:38.520" style="s2">is in a deterministic universe you</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.540" end="00:48:40.680" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know because all of this was</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.520" end="00:48:44.340" style="s2">predestined from the very first particle</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.680" end="00:48:47.340" style="s2">interactions yep then you know okay I</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.340" end="00:48:50.100" style="s2">get it but what does it predict so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.340" end="00:48:52.680" style="s2">bottom line here we have a rigorous set</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.100" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">of tools it involves using terms that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.680" end="00:48:58.470" style="s2">people have butchered by misusing them</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.680" end="00:49:01.140" style="s2">and if we can resurrect those tools and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.470" end="00:49:03.300" style="s2">just use them consistently and well I</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.140" end="00:49:05.310" style="s2">believe we are halfway out of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.300" end="00:49:07.410" style="s2">meaning-making crisis because we will at</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.310" end="00:49:09.330" style="s2">least know what the hierarchy of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.410" end="00:49:12.510" style="s2">is you know are you offering a</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.330" end="00:49:14.730" style="s2">hypothesis is it a theory is it just a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.510" end="00:49:20.270" style="s2">notion you know knowing where things fit</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.730" end="00:49:23.190" style="s2">I believe will be very helpful and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.270" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">probably should not point out that one</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.190" end="00:49:27.540" style="s2">place where this is very important is</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:30.060" style="s2">hypotheses of collusion which get</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.540" end="00:49:32.520" style="s2">dismissed by boosting them to the level</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.060" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">of theory which they don&#39;t deserve not</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.520" end="00:49:36.930" style="s2">until they&#39;ve been demonstrated so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:38.850" style="s2">know Watergate to call them collusion</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.930" end="00:49:40.740" style="s2">hypotheses now do we well I&#39;m using the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.850" end="00:49:43.140" style="s2">word collusion because conspiracy has</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.740" end="00:49:44.910" style="s2">become so tightly associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.140" end="00:49:47.340" style="s2">word theory that it&#39;s like an instant</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.910" end="00:49:50.370" style="s2">grounds for dismissal and so my point</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.340" end="00:49:53.310" style="s2">would be Watergate is a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.370" end="00:49:56.490" style="s2">theory right we all assume it happened</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.310" end="00:49:58.740" style="s2">right lizard people is a falsified</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.490" end="00:50:03.660" style="s2">hypothesis we can falsify it on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.740" end="00:50:06.810" style="s2">basis of phylogenetics right 9/11 was an</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.660" end="00:50:10.620" style="s2">inside job that&#39;s a hypothesis right</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.810" end="00:50:13.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not the theory right I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.620" end="00:50:15.510" style="s2">falsified as far as I&#39;m concerned but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.530" end="00:50:18.870" style="s2">fits in with a bunch of other theories</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.510" end="00:50:21.180" style="s2">including the the 9/11 Commission&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.870" end="00:50:22.410" style="s2">theory of what happened or hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.180" end="00:50:25.890" style="s2">and what happens hard to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.410" end="00:50:28.350" style="s2">harvick even straight yeah so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.890" end="00:50:29.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know let&#39;s try to be consistent</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.350" end="00:50:31.230" style="s2">with the terminology I&#39;ll try to do a</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.730" end="00:50:34.620" style="s2">better job that I just did there in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.230" end="00:50:37.140" style="s2">last sentence but Watergate now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.620" end="00:50:38.730" style="s2">the conspiracy theory yeah good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.140" end="00:50:40.740" style="s2">all right we&#39;re we&#39;re not too far from</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.730" end="00:50:43.830" style="s2">an hour do we want to just touch on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.740" end="00:50:45.150" style="s2">couple of addendums and corrections from</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.830" end="00:50:46.770" style="s2">previous shows</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.150" end="00:50:50.579" style="s2">and then take a break okay I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.770" end="00:50:52.849" style="s2">got three of them here let&#39;s see in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.579" end="00:50:57.660" style="s2">super chat last time someone asked about</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.849" end="00:51:01.069" style="s2">a paper that&#39;s on a preprint a psycho a</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.500" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">of questions that we might just talk for</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.390" end="00:52:50.309" style="s2">a couple of minutes about start us off</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m having trouble remaining</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.309" end="00:52:57.730" style="s2">objective about this claim because</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:53:01.570" style="s2">you know I&#39;m I&#39;m watching the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.730" end="00:53:04.330" style="s2">as as a scientist and in general I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.570" end="00:53:06.340" style="s2">pretty good at keeping things straight</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.330" end="00:53:10.570" style="s2">and on the other hand and I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.340" end="00:53:16.530" style="s2">it as a father and I&#39;m having the sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.570" end="00:53:20.650" style="s2">of everything that makes life work is</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.530" end="00:53:22.930" style="s2">coming apart without clearly without</p>

<p begin="00:53:22.930" end="00:53:28.210" style="s2">replaces it and you know we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.300" end="00:53:30.520" style="s2">to be locked down forever no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.210" end="00:53:33.010" style="s2">happens even if we just end up facing</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.520" end="00:53:35.650" style="s2">the virus and you know tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.010" end="00:53:37.390" style="s2">die needlessly which is not something</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.650" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">I&#39;m advocating and I know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.390" end="00:53:43.420" style="s2">advocating but even if that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:46.210" style="s2">end up doing we will escape lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.420" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">soon enough and things will go sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.210" end="00:53:50.349" style="s2">back to some kind of normalcy I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:54.490" style="s2">think they go back to normal if they go</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.349" end="00:53:59.650" style="s2">back to something but I do think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.490" end="00:54:06.460" style="s2">lost our innocence and I wonder I really</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.650" end="00:54:09.430" style="s2">wonder about how how romantic love</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.460" end="00:54:11.349" style="s2">emerges from this for people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.430" end="00:54:13.900" style="s2">the early phase of their life where</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.349" end="00:54:15.400" style="s2">they&#39;re still trying to figure out who</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.900" end="00:54:17.020" style="s2">they are and who they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.400" end="00:54:19.869" style="s2">with and how they&#39;re going to find them</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.020" end="00:54:23.260" style="s2">and how they&#39;re going to court and woo</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.869" end="00:54:24.670" style="s2">and do all sorts of things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.260" end="00:54:27.490" style="s2">gonna need to do whatever the modern</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.670" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">terms for those things are so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.490" end="00:54:35.290" style="s2">guess I guess the point is there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:38.170" style="s2">know if I hear that people return to</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.290" end="00:54:39.700" style="s2">traditional gender roles in part that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.170" end="00:54:41.109" style="s2">goes very much against what you and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.700" end="00:54:43.180" style="s2">have been advocating which is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.109" end="00:54:45.609" style="s2">time for a renegotiation of those roles</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.180" end="00:54:47.109" style="s2">because so much is different about males</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.609" end="00:54:50.320" style="s2">and females in the world we live in on</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.109" end="00:54:52.780" style="s2">the other hand you know at least there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.320" end="00:54:55.930" style="s2">some pattern there there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.780" end="00:54:57.490" style="s2">that people could depend on and and this</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.930" end="00:54:59.560" style="s2">is I mean I think I think the argument</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.490" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">which is that in times of deep</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.560" end="00:55:04.450" style="s2">uncertainty where maybe what you need is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:06.280" style="s2">a totally new approach but knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.450" end="00:55:07.720" style="s2">totally new approaches are very likely</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.280" end="00:55:09.970" style="s2">to be flawed the shaman is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.720" end="00:55:11.619" style="s2">more likely to be wrong than right even</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.970" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">though you need the exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.619" end="00:55:15.270" style="s2">shamanistic approach people are more</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:18.040" style="s2">likely to retreat to the known</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.270" end="00:55:19.210" style="s2">comfortable they understood even if its</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.040" end="00:55:24.900" style="s2">patterns that they themselves were</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.210" end="00:55:27.330" style="s2">fighting against before yeah so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.900" end="00:55:31.540" style="s2">mean that does feel a little bit right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.330" end="00:55:34.270" style="s2">that we do need until the new way has</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.540" end="00:55:36.700" style="s2">been plausibly spelled out and you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.270" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">the way this is done in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.700" end="00:55:41.830" style="s2">modern markets is nothing like a viable</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:43.540" style="s2">new way but until some new way has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.830" end="00:55:47.560" style="s2">spelled out until somebody has proposed</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.540" end="00:55:53.670" style="s2">the renegotiated arrangement between man</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.560" end="00:55:56.470" style="s2">and woman I get why people would retreat</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.670" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">mm-hmm so let me just say one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.470" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">about this paper which I read it just</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:02.260" style="s2">quickly before this and you haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:04.210" style="s2">a chance to yet so you don&#39;t you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.260" end="00:56:06.609" style="s2">not looked at their methods with regard</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.210" end="00:56:08.349" style="s2">to testing whether or not people were</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.609" end="00:56:10.240" style="s2">endorsing gender stereotypes at higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.349" end="00:56:11.800" style="s2">rates after the pandemic or during the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.240" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">pandemic versus before for which they</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.800" end="00:56:19.630" style="s2">found statistical evidence their methods</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:21.190" style="s2">I find really weak and a little strange</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.630" end="00:56:23.070" style="s2">and that&#39;s not I think just because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.190" end="00:56:26.230" style="s2">find the gender stereotypes themselves</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.070" end="00:56:29.470" style="s2">no not not particularly comforting at</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.230" end="00:56:30.849" style="s2">all but a man like I put you on the spot</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.470" end="00:56:32.560" style="s2">and say what you&#39;ll come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.849" end="00:56:35.080" style="s2">gender stereotypes here but I think all</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.560" end="00:56:37.510" style="s2">of us just listening and so such can</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.080" end="00:56:39.820" style="s2">imagine what it is that you might think</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.510" end="00:56:42.280" style="s2">you know what is what would it be like</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.820" end="00:56:44.109" style="s2">to be more masculine or manly you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.280" end="00:56:46.750" style="s2">think of some things and now would it be</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.109" end="00:56:49.060" style="s2">like to be more feminine or womanly</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.750" end="00:56:51.760" style="s2">think of a few things for a moment and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.060" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">now let me share with you the words that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.760" end="00:56:57.190" style="s2">they used which is that you know they</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:58.240" style="s2">treat these as they say endorsement of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.190" end="00:57:00.490" style="s2">traditional gender stereotypes was</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.240" end="00:57:02.140" style="s2">assessed by eight items of these eight</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.490" end="00:57:03.430" style="s2">items for items assess attitudes towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.140" end="00:57:05.020" style="s2">men and four towards women so we got</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.430" end="00:57:07.270" style="s2">eight words for Everage is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.020" end="00:57:09.490" style="s2">be more masculine and for every supposed</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.270" end="00:57:11.530" style="s2">to be for feminine for the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.490" end="00:57:15.609" style="s2">ones we have risk-taking brave</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.530" end="00:57:19.180" style="s2">courageous and adventurous that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.609" end="00:57:21.070" style="s2">strike me as four things it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.180" end="00:57:21.530" style="s2">love them all but that doesn&#39;t strike me</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.070" end="00:57:23.990" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.530" end="00:57:26.330" style="s2">independent things and four attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.990" end="00:57:30.940" style="s2">towards women the four things that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.330" end="00:57:35.960" style="s2">supposedly did were clean hygienic</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.940" end="00:57:37.850" style="s2">sanitary and pristine which problem with</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.960" end="00:57:39.560" style="s2">the category but it&#39;s only one category</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.850" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">right like they have basically braved</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.560" end="00:57:45.640" style="s2">versus clean and like I could I could</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:49.070" style="s2">tear apart they like women are clean</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.640" end="00:57:51.050" style="s2">thing but you know probably most people</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.070" end="00:57:52.550" style="s2">watching or listening came up with some</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.050" end="00:57:54.710" style="s2">version of courageous or risk-taking her</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.550" end="00:57:57.830" style="s2">adventurous as being a typically more</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.710" end="00:57:59.600" style="s2">masculine trait but and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.830" end="00:58:02.420" style="s2">which many women would like to you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.600" end="00:58:05.720" style="s2">are also engaged in a lot but this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.420" end="00:58:08.030" style="s2">eight this isn&#39;t a things at most it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.720" end="00:58:09.560" style="s2">two and one of those two which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.030" end="00:58:11.900" style="s2">represented by four words here is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.560" end="00:58:13.460" style="s2">questionable in and of itself so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.900" end="00:58:15.980" style="s2">compelled by at least that part of not</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.460" end="00:58:17.720" style="s2">this research I ain&#39;t seen the methods</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.980" end="00:58:20.780" style="s2">but that sounds like a weird kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.720" end="00:58:22.460" style="s2">pseudo replication exactly yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.780" end="00:58:24.830" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a lot more we could do</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.460" end="00:58:26.060" style="s2">on that paper but let&#39;s since I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.830" end="00:58:29.450" style="s2">we&#39;re coming to an hour let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.060" end="00:58:32.060" style="s2">quickly talk about two more things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.450" end="00:58:33.770" style="s2">have come up in the past oh I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.060" end="00:58:36.580" style="s2">which live stream it was we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.770" end="00:58:39.140" style="s2">about that Contra Costa study that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.580" end="00:58:41.600" style="s2">presumed to show that invited people via</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.140" end="00:58:42.800" style="s2">Facebook and it turns out the wife of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.600" end="00:58:44.390" style="s2">the principal investigator was</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.800" end="00:58:45.770" style="s2">specifically promising people that they</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.390" end="00:58:47.240" style="s2">would be able to get tested if they came</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.770" end="00:58:50.180" style="s2">up positive they might be more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.240" end="00:58:51.890" style="s2">go back to work in Contra Costa County</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.180" end="00:58:54.740" style="s2">which is the county in California that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.890" end="00:58:56.210" style="s2">has San Jose Silicon Valley etc we</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.740" end="00:58:57.860" style="s2">talked a lot about the various reasons</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.210" end="00:58:59.630" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t trust the results well</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.860" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s another thing now that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.630" end="00:59:05.260" style="s2">I own lis find it on BuzzFeed news which</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:09.730" style="s2">is obviously a questionable source but</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.260" end="00:59:12.140" style="s2">they find that they whistleblower</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.730" end="00:59:15.380" style="s2">complaint has been lodged at Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.140" end="00:59:17.660" style="s2">claiming that JetBlue&#39;s founder helped</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.380" end="00:59:19.850" style="s2">fund the study and that that which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.660" end="00:59:21.470" style="s2">potentially a pretty big conflict of</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.850" end="00:59:23.960" style="s2">interest in the financing the study was</p>

<p begin="00:59:23.960" end="00:59:28.550" style="s2">study so you know one more thing to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.450" end="00:59:31.890" style="s2">a suspect that that whole that whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.550" end="00:59:34.019" style="s2">study was politically motivated at bat</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.890" end="00:59:36.119" style="s2">and but don&#39;t you know potentially quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.019" end="00:59:38.910" style="s2">skewed I don&#39;t know if you have anything</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.119" end="00:59:41.460" style="s2">well kids if you&#39;re going to go with</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.910" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">corrupt study design go big or go home</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.460" end="00:59:47.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the lesson here there you go</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">okay and finally I think it was last</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.880" end="00:59:56.730" style="s2">time or the time before you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:58.950" style="s2">about the aircraft carrier that okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.730" end="01:00:00.750" style="s2">fill us in here yeah there was an</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.950" end="01:00:02.700" style="s2">alarming report this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.750" end="01:00:04.769" style="s2">things I fear most in this crisis an</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.700" end="01:00:11.700" style="s2">alarming report of people who had</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.769" end="01:00:13.410" style="s2">recovered from kovat 19 who were showing</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.700" end="01:00:16.680" style="s2">signs of a new infection and this would</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.410" end="01:00:18.119" style="s2">be disastrous it&#39;s still possible off of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.680" end="01:00:21.569" style="s2">the IQ just can&#39;t think of the name of</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.119" end="01:00:23.309" style="s2">yours a belt yeah um so this would be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.569" end="01:00:25.829" style="s2">terrible thing if you if it turned out</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.309" end="01:00:27.869" style="s2">that having had it once didn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.829" end="01:00:29.460" style="s2">you were immune not even for a short</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.869" end="01:00:31.980" style="s2">period of time that you could get it</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.460" end="01:00:33.779" style="s2">again almost immediately so what we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.980" end="01:00:39.960" style="s2">now begun to see I&#39;m gonna put the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.779" end="01:00:43.829" style="s2">screen Zack South Korea is evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.960" end="01:00:45.480" style="s2">the second wave of positive tests on</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.829" end="01:00:47.160" style="s2">these people is not the result of new</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.480" end="01:00:50.700" style="s2">infection but it is in fact the result</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.160" end="01:00:52.589" style="s2">of them shedding forgive the term here</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.700" end="01:00:53.700" style="s2">for a second but dead virus people will</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.589" end="01:00:55.980" style="s2">complain about that and they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.700" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">viruses are not alive to begin with we</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.980" end="01:00:59.819" style="s2">don&#39;t need to fight about it the point</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:01:01.769" style="s2">is you&#39;ve got viruses that are capable</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.819" end="01:01:03.359" style="s2">of inducing an infection these are</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.769" end="01:01:05.579" style="s2">complete viruses and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.359" end="01:01:08.490" style="s2">fragments and these tests are such that</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.579" end="01:01:11.609" style="s2">they don&#39;t detect an entire viral they</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.490" end="01:01:14.579" style="s2">they detect a particle that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.609" end="01:01:16.950" style="s2">recognizably viral in origin but that</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.579" end="01:01:18.210" style="s2">does not mean that you have active virus</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.950" end="01:01:22.109" style="s2">in your system so I think in this case</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.210" end="01:01:24.180" style="s2">they were actually shedding dead cells</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.109" end="01:01:25.920" style="s2">from their lungs that had been infected</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.180" end="01:01:27.269" style="s2">and it&#39;s not surprising that those would</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.920" end="01:01:29.039" style="s2">have molecules that would trigger these</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.269" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">tests yeah I don&#39;t know if it was lungs</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.039" end="01:01:34.319" style="s2">because the only one last thing I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:36.650" style="s2">to say about this that you had you would</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.319" end="01:01:39.809" style="s2">found this on the Bloomberg site and</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.650" end="01:01:41.490" style="s2">strangely they uh yeah I guess you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.809" end="01:01:43.710" style="s2">put that up Zack you had found that on</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.490" end="01:01:45.809" style="s2">the Bloomberg site and they didn&#39;t link</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.710" end="01:01:48.269" style="s2">to what should have been a preprint</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.809" end="01:01:50.039" style="s2">we don&#39;t expect it to be a peer-reviewed</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.269" end="01:01:52.349" style="s2">article at this point but a preprint and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.039" end="01:01:54.930" style="s2">so I went looking and I found Stars and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.349" end="01:01:57.930" style="s2">Stripes I found other Jones I found</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.930" end="01:01:59.609" style="s2">Forbes here and all of them are telling</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.930" end="01:02:02.729" style="s2">the same story but none of them have</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.609" end="01:02:05.609" style="s2">links to the preprint and you look the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.729" end="01:02:07.589" style="s2">only thing that I see to indicate why is</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.609" end="01:02:09.449" style="s2">the top of this Forbes story which says</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.589" end="01:02:12.449" style="s2">South Korea&#39;s health agency announced</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.449" end="01:02:16.049" style="s2">Monday which sounds like it was a press</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.449" end="01:02:18.209" style="s2">conference which is really even such a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.049" end="01:02:20.759" style="s2">lower bar than anything else that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.209" end="01:02:22.859" style="s2">have yet seen this means that really</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.759" end="01:02:25.109" style="s2">really hope this is true like this this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.859" end="01:02:27.420" style="s2">flips the script again back to okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.109" end="01:02:29.339" style="s2">hopefully if you&#39;ve had it and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.420" end="01:02:30.959" style="s2">got antibodies you will now have some</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.339" end="01:02:34.650" style="s2">level immunity and you cannot get it</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.959" end="01:02:36.509" style="s2">again or have it reemerge but this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.650" end="01:02:40.859" style="s2">200 I think they were looking at 400</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.509" end="01:02:42.660" style="s2">people maybe 285 of which had it a test</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.859" end="01:02:44.670" style="s2">of negative a test is positive again and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.660" end="01:02:47.430" style="s2">they go and find these dead in quotes</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.670" end="01:02:49.650" style="s2">virus viruses that are causing the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.430" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">antibody test to test positive again but</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.650" end="01:02:55.019" style="s2">all of that all of that that I just said</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:57.420" style="s2">is hearsay because it&#39;s from a press</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.019" end="01:03:01.499" style="s2">conference we aren&#39;t we haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.420" end="01:03:02.999" style="s2">allowed into the scientific paper and of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.499" end="01:03:04.739" style="s2">course scientific papers almost never</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.999" end="01:03:07.109" style="s2">have links to the actual databases and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.739" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">you know most people can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.109" end="01:03:10.199" style="s2">appropriate analysis on someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:13.140" style="s2">data set especially if they&#39;re outside</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.199" end="01:03:15.839" style="s2">of their own field but you can do what</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.140" end="01:03:18.089" style="s2">we did for instance fun you know this</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.839" end="01:03:19.949" style="s2">Rosenfeld and tomiyama paper on whether</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.089" end="01:03:21.179" style="s2">or not open pandemic can make people</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.949" end="01:03:23.189" style="s2">more socially conservative for what we</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.179" end="01:03:24.989" style="s2">did specifically with that Contra Costa</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.189" end="01:03:27.420" style="s2">study paper went to looked at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.989" end="01:03:29.009" style="s2">methods wet methods are not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.420" end="01:03:30.959" style="s2">reliable here therefore we at the very</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.009" end="01:03:32.609" style="s2">least can&#39;t say that they they think</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.959" end="01:03:34.199" style="s2">that they found what they think they</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.609" end="01:03:36.569" style="s2">found or they found what they say they</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.199" end="01:03:38.969" style="s2">found in this case we can&#39;t do that and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.569" end="01:03:41.369" style="s2">that means you know I really hope it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.969" end="01:03:43.650" style="s2">true but where is the preprint if if</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.369" end="01:03:45.119" style="s2">they did this work like it needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.650" end="01:03:47.130" style="s2">out there on the farm of a paper and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.119" end="01:03:48.749" style="s2">preprints allow multiple revisions up</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.130" end="01:03:51.179" style="s2">until you up until it&#39;s accepted</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.749" end="01:03:53.369" style="s2">somewhere and published so it should be</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.179" end="01:03:54.900" style="s2">out there and I really I can&#39;t see what</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.369" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">the excuses for it not being available</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.900" end="01:03:58.370" style="s2">for people to look at so this is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:04:00.710" style="s2">particular thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.370" end="01:04:03.050" style="s2">rare in my experience but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.710" end="01:04:04.760" style="s2">unheard of and it is a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.050" end="01:04:08.510" style="s2">corruption of the method this is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.760" end="01:04:10.940" style="s2">opposite of doing your peer-review out</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.510" end="01:04:13.070" style="s2">in the open this is yeah nobody is even</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.940" end="01:04:17.180" style="s2">able to access it now here presumably</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.070" end="01:04:20.570" style="s2">this is not intentional but I recall in</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.180" end="01:04:23.000" style="s2">my own past in my paper on telomere</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.570" end="01:04:26.150" style="s2">senescence and cancer I had a prediction</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.000" end="01:04:30.320" style="s2">about cloned mammals and in particular</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.150" end="01:04:33.590" style="s2">Dolly that she would die of Dolly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.320" end="01:04:38.120" style="s2">first cloned mammal sheep and she would</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.590" end="01:04:39.830" style="s2">die of pathologies that were beyond what</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.120" end="01:04:43.070" style="s2">her age would predict she would have and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.830" end="01:04:45.530" style="s2">at the point that she died we of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.070" end="01:04:47.330" style="s2">pathology is beyond the age at which she</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.530" end="01:04:49.370" style="s2">was we don&#39;t know because they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.330" end="01:04:51.770" style="s2">publish it they told us that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.370" end="01:04:53.480" style="s2">the case they told us that they had put</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.770" end="01:04:55.010" style="s2">her to sleep to put her out of her</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.480" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">misery because they couldn&#39;t stand to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.010" end="01:04:59.390" style="s2">see her suffer from the pathologies that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:02.540" style="s2">she had that they start but but she died</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.390" end="01:05:05.030" style="s2">far earlier that most sheep of her</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.540" end="01:05:07.130" style="s2">species well they for the specifics but</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.030" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">we don&#39;t know because they euthanized</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.130" end="01:05:11.990" style="s2">her but she did know how old she was</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:12.980" style="s2">yes they euthanized her claimed it had</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.990" end="01:05:17.270" style="s2">nothing to do with age-related</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.980" end="01:05:19.790" style="s2">pathologies she did have early arthritis</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.270" end="01:05:21.860" style="s2">but in any case it made it impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.790" end="01:05:23.990" style="s2">evaluate so there was a hypothesis test</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.860" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">that had been run effectively but we</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.990" end="01:05:28.790" style="s2">weren&#39;t allowed to see the the result of</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:31.130" style="s2">it so anyway this is something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.790" end="01:05:35.420" style="s2">something that happens and it is a it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.130" end="01:05:41.470" style="s2">really problematic when it does all</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.420" end="01:05:43.490" style="s2">right I think we&#39;re good we are going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.470" end="01:05:46.100" style="s2">do we want to say something about what</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.490" end="01:05:48.260" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do next time or we wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.100" end="01:05:51.350" style="s2">leave that on say I think we can say</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.260" end="01:05:53.270" style="s2">something okay um so I I we don&#39;t we</p>
