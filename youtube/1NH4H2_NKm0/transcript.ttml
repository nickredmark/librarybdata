<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:11.750" style="s2">conducted many more interviews and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.299" end="00:01:13.070" style="s2">have oh it&#39;s been a while well you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.750" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">you have people on 3cr</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.070" end="00:01:16.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve listened to a few of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:18.200" style="s2">conversations Oh interesting yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.490" end="00:01:20.180" style="s2">yeah well I mean I&#39;ve just had Peter</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.200" end="00:01:21.619" style="s2">just ed on the podcast I spoke to him</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.180" end="00:01:23.869" style="s2">last year but I know you&#39;ve had him on</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.619" end="00:01:25.850" style="s2">previously as well and I did watch that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.869" end="00:01:27.350" style="s2">when he linked it to me and he&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:29.180" style="s2">an interesting guy to listen to very</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.350" end="00:01:31.850" style="s2">interesting yeah it was an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.180" end="00:01:33.800" style="s2">conversation but given that in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.850" end="00:01:35.300" style="s2">this is well I don&#39;t imagine this to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.800" end="00:01:37.009" style="s2">an interview it&#39;s not precisely what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.300" end="00:01:39.830" style="s2">go into these things with the mind to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.009" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">but given that the boot is slightly on</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.830" end="00:01:43.729" style="s2">the other foot here if you could ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:46.850" style="s2">yourself a question to get yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.729" end="00:01:48.440" style="s2">primed I mean because I what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.850" end="00:01:49.850" style="s2">has you at the moment something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.440" end="00:01:51.259" style="s2">working on that&#39;s just really</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.850" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">captivating you and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.259" end="00:01:57.470" style="s2">figure out I have an obsession of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:02:01.610" style="s2">and that obsession has been for a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.470" end="00:02:03.259" style="s2">time around what abstract is what what</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.610" end="00:02:04.879" style="s2">is this the abstract well because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.259" end="00:02:07.039" style="s2">think that most of the world we live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.879" end="00:02:09.770" style="s2">most of the day-to-day world is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.039" end="00:02:11.750" style="s2">abstract and we don&#39;t realize it there</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.770" end="00:02:13.160" style="s2">was this great video I found on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.750" end="00:02:14.989" style="s2">that people might have come across</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.160" end="00:02:17.569" style="s2">before called I think it was something</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.989" end="00:02:20.090" style="s2">from reddit but a guy did a vocal thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.569" end="00:02:21.489" style="s2">of it called kill theory okay and and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.090" end="00:02:23.780" style="s2">was just a silly little story about</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.489" end="00:02:25.610" style="s2">hamburgers and you eat a hamburger but</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.780" end="00:02:29.230" style="s2">but the concept of it was that there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.610" end="00:02:32.090" style="s2">different levels so level 1 or q1 is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.230" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">this reality right here that I can see</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.090" end="00:02:36.230" style="s2">in front of me that is what my sensory</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:38.420" style="s2">array picks up right so all of my senses</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.230" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">not just a 5 we usually think I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.420" end="00:02:43.849" style="s2">all the senses that&#39;s Q level 1 right</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:46.040" style="s2">but you&#39;ll level 2 is like when you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.849" end="00:02:47.989" style="s2">talk about your friend who&#39;s outside of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.040" end="00:02:49.700" style="s2">your sensory array now about something</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.989" end="00:02:52.159" style="s2">that they&#39;re doing and then level 3</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.700" end="00:02:53.659" style="s2">might be talking about what you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.159" end="00:02:55.129" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking about even though</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.659" end="00:02:57.470" style="s2">they&#39;re not even gonna say you know so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.129" end="00:02:59.269" style="s2">it goes on and on grows in complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.470" end="00:03:02.090" style="s2">and we do these tasks all the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.269" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">there&#39;s this abstraction task and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.090" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">been obsessing over this because I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">that we have increasingly come into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:12.290" style="s2">more and more abstract world as we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:13.670" style="s2">become more connected so as we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.290" end="00:03:15.709" style="s2">lowered the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.670" end="00:03:18.440" style="s2">boundaries between each other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.709" end="00:03:20.120" style="s2">actually put up these new boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.440" end="00:03:22.780" style="s2">that are invisible to us that are these</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.120" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">sort of neuro-linguistic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.780" end="00:03:27.319" style="s2">boundaries these strange boundaries that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:29.000" style="s2">are hard to describe hard to see cuz</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.319" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">they&#39;re somewhere in between the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.000" end="00:03:32.810" style="s2">language and how our brains work and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.780" style="s2">our culture works and how our</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.810" end="00:03:37.220" style="s2">communities operate and I&#39;m obsessing</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.780" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">over this question and I&#39;ve been getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.220" end="00:03:42.140" style="s2">into I&#39;m listening to a another podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:46.569" style="s2">at the moment called a culture that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.140" end="00:03:48.860" style="s2">culture and just getting into how that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.569" end="00:03:51.230" style="s2">discourse works I suppose what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.860" end="00:03:53.170" style="s2">occult discourse is and a lot of it does</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.230" end="00:03:55.250" style="s2">seem to be around this question of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.170" end="00:03:58.580" style="s2">abstraction of what the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.250" end="00:04:00.970" style="s2">reality actually is and of what what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.580" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">are what I am what you are in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.970" end="00:04:06.920" style="s2">reality thing that were in mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s a difficult one whom do</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.920" end="00:04:09.799" style="s2">you think that do you think that so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:11.600" style="s2">let&#39;s go back I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.799" end="00:04:13.100" style="s2">anatomically modern human beings it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.600" end="00:04:15.019" style="s2">roughly two hundred thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.100" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">of course we were just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.019" end="00:04:18.919" style="s2">different before then and going back but</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:20.450" style="s2">let&#39;s just say fifty thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.919" end="00:04:22.640" style="s2">when we&#39;re well and truly hunters and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.450" end="00:04:24.860" style="s2">gatherers do you think that we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.640" end="00:04:27.229" style="s2">living in a world that was more real</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.860" end="00:04:28.669" style="s2">then in a sense or do you rather think</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.229" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">that that same process of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.669" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">was happening it&#39;s just it wasn&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:36.620" style="s2">such a degree of complexity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">option B yeah I think it&#39;s always being</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.620" end="00:04:41.210" style="s2">a process of I don&#39;t think this is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:43.400" style="s2">happening to us humans I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.210" end="00:04:45.950" style="s2">does happen to other creatures it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.400" end="00:04:47.479" style="s2">hard to know to what extent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.950" end="00:04:49.820" style="s2">happening and it&#39;s it does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.479" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">certainly unique in us and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.820" end="00:04:53.780" style="s2">got a lot to do with a frontal lobe and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:56.900" style="s2">our ability to store information recall</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.780" end="00:04:58.729" style="s2">it and and this process yeah no I do</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.900" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">think that we probably have to spend</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.729" end="00:05:02.539" style="s2">quite a long time really getting clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:04.310" style="s2">on on everything we mean that might go</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.539" end="00:05:06.440" style="s2">into a conversation to unpack something</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.310" end="00:05:09.200" style="s2">like this but I do think that really</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.440" end="00:05:10.820" style="s2">that hits at perhaps one of its it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.200" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">definitely one of the core difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.820" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">with being a human being at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:15.800" style="s2">of course there&#39;s a question of truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:17.690" style="s2">wrapped up in there that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.800" end="00:05:19.220" style="s2">question of what is most real I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.690" end="00:05:22.039" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.220" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">about here is like if the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.039" end="00:05:27.320" style="s2">our being is experiencing iterative</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:28.039" style="s2">moments of abstraction at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.320" end="00:05:30.020" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.039" end="00:05:33.319" style="s2">do we have to find the right system of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:34.819" style="s2">abstractions that serves that process of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.319" end="00:05:37.069" style="s2">making abstractions are we trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.819" end="00:05:39.110" style="s2">serve something more real behind it are</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.069" end="00:05:41.779" style="s2">we are we trying to serve the human race</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.110" end="00:05:43.669" style="s2">as distinct from other animal species or</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.779" end="00:05:45.740" style="s2">other organisms perhaps the universe</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.669" end="00:05:49.189" style="s2">itself like to what extent are we</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.740" end="00:05:50.930" style="s2">connected with some sort of source of</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.469" end="00:06:40.819" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to describe is dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.749" end="00:06:43.969" style="s2">tendencies and dogmatic tendencies</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:54.169" style="s2">we do get a lot of dogmatic type</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.990" end="00:07:06.680" style="s2">and these are these are the questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.459" end="00:07:08.599" style="s2">that we&#39;re really circling around a lot</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.569" end="00:07:22.699" style="s2">think that watching the whole Trump</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.260" end="00:12:15.550" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s like I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.240" end="00:12:17.350" style="s2">people don&#39;t like using these sorts of</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.350" end="00:12:20.980" style="s2">context but I literally think it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.910" end="00:12:22.870" style="s2">of a schizophrenic drift that we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.980" end="00:12:24.250" style="s2">that there&#39;s a material world and</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.170" end="00:12:30.970" style="s2">the way that I see it is it&#39;s one in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:33.700" style="s2">same world it&#39;s all around us it this is</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:47.980" style="s2">sort of narrative plays out and I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.140" end="00:12:50.680" style="s2">that that division ends up putting us in</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.980" end="00:12:53.709" style="s2">a lot of strife because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.680" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">division has seeped into how some of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.709" end="00:12:58.540" style="s2">scientific institutions operate that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to be quite hard and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:03.070" style="s2">materialistic and reductionistic to such</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">an extent that they&#39;re forgetting that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.070" end="00:13:07.060" style="s2">it&#39;s the connections between things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:09.459" style="s2">make a lot of these things happen that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.060" end="00:13:10.380" style="s2">sometimes you need the and we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.459" end="00:13:11.529" style="s2">it more now but you need</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.380" end="00:13:13.480" style="s2">interdisciplinary and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.529" end="00:13:15.190" style="s2">multidisciplinary approaches to answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.480" end="00:13:16.779" style="s2">some of these difficult questions you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.190" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">can&#39;t just keep making it smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.779" end="00:13:20.500" style="s2">smaller and smaller and finding the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:22.029" style="s2">building blocks of things because</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.500" end="00:13:24.100" style="s2">sometimes the building block only works</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.029" end="00:13:28.300" style="s2">in context with other things and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.100" end="00:13:29.890" style="s2">that approach has modeled some people</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.300" end="00:13:31.690" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s where this scientism</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.890" end="00:13:33.459" style="s2">term comes from the reason why I hate it</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.690" end="00:13:35.910" style="s2">it&#39;s because usually gets used by like</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.459" end="00:13:38.770" style="s2">flat-earthers or other ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.910" end="00:13:41.560" style="s2">conceived just broken their brain on</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.770" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">these really absurd sort of questions I</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.560" end="00:13:46.930" style="s2">understand sort of the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.959" end="00:13:48.520" style="s2">discourse desired by it to try and like</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.930" end="00:13:50.200" style="s2">though what do I actually know but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.520" end="00:13:53.260" style="s2">think there&#39;s a far better ways to do it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.200" end="00:13:56.170" style="s2">then go down a flat earth Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.260" end="00:13:58.209" style="s2">black hole but when those people come up</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.170" end="00:13:59.770" style="s2">against and I when I&#39;ve spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.209" end="00:14:01.779" style="s2">friends of mine who go down these and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.770" end="00:14:03.820" style="s2">conspiracy black holes they speak about</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.779" end="00:14:07.390" style="s2">getting frustrated with people that have</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.820" end="00:14:09.630" style="s2">this very hard materialistic view that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.390" end="00:14:11.949" style="s2">thinks that everything is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.630" end="00:14:13.570" style="s2">inanimate apart from yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.949" end="00:14:15.390" style="s2">there&#39;s something special about the self</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.570" end="00:14:17.410" style="s2">and I&#39;ll sort of almost have like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.390" end="00:14:20.500" style="s2">thinking of soul or maybe they just</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.410" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">think that the odds just people that say</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.500" end="00:14:24.930" style="s2">it&#39;s justice or just that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:26.790" style="s2">and I mean maybe this is a deviation</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.930" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">onto another topic that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.790" end="00:14:31.260" style="s2">talk about that one of my greatest</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:33.959" style="s2">frustrations in trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.260" end="00:14:36.120" style="s2">altered experiences through psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.959" end="00:14:37.890" style="s2">chemicals is when people are like ah but</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.120" end="00:14:40.290" style="s2">that&#39;s just your brain on drugs you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.890" end="00:14:43.890" style="s2">like what a dismissal of a phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.290" end="00:14:45.690" style="s2">that is clearly intriguing yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.890" end="00:14:48.180" style="s2">because the question is not as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.690" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">oh you put the bird in the drug</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.180" end="00:14:52.170" style="s2">interacts with this molecule and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.300" style="s2">that you know that&#39;s all it is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.170" end="00:14:58.640" style="s2">like no it&#39;s not all it is I am met and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:15:01.019" style="s2">spoke with like probably alien morphing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.640" end="00:15:03.630" style="s2">multi-dimensional rainbow creatures like</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.019" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">that is not described by that chemical</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.630" end="00:15:09.380" style="s2">interaction yeah so yep we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:12.149" style="s2">those bubbly rainbow aliens in a second</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.380" end="00:15:13.890" style="s2">but you know what just occurs to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.149" end="00:15:16.350" style="s2">there and it&#39;s something that I do think</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.890" end="00:15:20.070" style="s2">about a bit is that well so two things</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.350" end="00:15:23.970" style="s2">one if there&#39;s a domain in which you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.070" end="00:15:26.579" style="s2">understand the response people have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.970" end="00:15:28.860" style="s2">just sideline psychedelics to try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.579" end="00:15:30.209" style="s2">dismiss them as something not only</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.860" end="00:15:32.579" style="s2">dismiss them as something that could</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.209" end="00:15:34.290" style="s2">lead to I want to say a greater truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.579" end="00:15:36.360" style="s2">but important discoveries about our own</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.290" end="00:15:38.700" style="s2">minds and perhaps the universe itself at</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.360" end="00:15:41.310" style="s2">a really metaphysical level but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.700" end="00:15:44.130" style="s2">is that that engaging with them we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.310" end="00:15:46.890" style="s2">have really we have the beginnings of an</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.130" end="00:15:49.140" style="s2">appropriate paradigm in which to try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.890" end="00:15:51.720" style="s2">understand and relate to that experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.140" end="00:15:54.380" style="s2">and it makes sense to me that there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.720" end="00:15:56.910" style="s2">certain individuals who are more</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.380" end="00:15:59.310" style="s2">constituted to be able to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.910" end="00:16:01.110" style="s2">to begin with the reality is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.310" end="00:16:04.020" style="s2">everybody is as inquisitive as other</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.110" end="00:16:05.730" style="s2">people yeah absolutely and we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.020" end="00:16:08.070" style="s2">able to put things in categories if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.730" end="00:16:09.720" style="s2">want to move on right and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.070" end="00:16:11.370" style="s2">totally understand people&#39;s fear</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.720" end="00:16:14.220" style="s2">response to something that is so</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.370" end="00:16:17.160" style="s2">fundamentally alien that our culture had</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.220" end="00:16:19.410" style="s2">to entirely outlaw it and if you do have</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.160" end="00:16:22.649" style="s2">that experience not only kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.410" end="00:16:25.079" style="s2">only is the dark side there as palpably</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.649" end="00:16:27.570" style="s2">on the other side of the curtain always</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.079" end="00:16:30.390" style="s2">ready to pierce itself out if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.570" end="00:16:32.070" style="s2">even if you are properly paying</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.390" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">attention and trying to deal with it the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.070" end="00:16:35.520" style="s2">fact is you&#39;re only paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:36.360" style="s2">the fact that you may have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.520" end="00:16:39.119" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.360" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">anywhere and you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.119" end="00:16:45.119" style="s2">difficult things to pass with it but</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:49.139" style="s2">it&#39;s hardly the tale of a proud and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.119" end="00:16:52.199" style="s2">successful and brave human race to just</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.139" end="00:16:55.019" style="s2">throw difficult and strange and scary</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.199" end="00:16:56.429" style="s2">things aside forever the fact is we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.019" end="00:16:58.379" style="s2">here because we have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.429" end="00:17:00.629" style="s2">confront things and learn things from</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.379" end="00:17:03.540" style="s2">them and so of course that is a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.629" end="00:17:06.419" style="s2">a strategy merely to sideline it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.540" end="00:17:08.909" style="s2">certainly you can understand why some</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.419" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">people had almost no other recourse than</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.909" end="00:17:15.299" style="s2">to just than to just bracket bracket it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:17.639" style="s2">off so I mean when it comes to trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.299" end="00:17:19.589" style="s2">talk to people who have not had much</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.639" end="00:17:21.870" style="s2">experience at all with psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.589" end="00:17:24.569" style="s2">may have just been fed what really are</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.870" end="00:17:26.730" style="s2">for the most part a bucket of lies about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.569" end="00:17:28.169" style="s2">not only the dangers and there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.730" end="00:17:29.429" style="s2">dangers but they&#39;re not the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.169" end="00:17:31.139" style="s2">dangerous that might be spoken about</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.429" end="00:17:32.850" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna think you&#39;re a glass of</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.139" end="00:17:34.440" style="s2">orange juice that can&#39;t sit down anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.850" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">because you might just tip out and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.440" end="00:17:40.289" style="s2">you&#39;ll be dead haha</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:44.789" style="s2">it&#39;s absurd well you know how that has</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.289" end="00:17:46.470" style="s2">happened let us know oh god I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.789" end="00:17:48.269" style="s2">from a man who was just having</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.470" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">experiences with that with rainbow</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.269" end="00:17:55.620" style="s2">aliens it&#39;s all manner of phenomena is</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:58.169" style="s2">out there but about how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.620" end="00:17:59.970" style="s2">you find talking to someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.169" end="00:18:01.679" style="s2">those psychological barriers of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.970" end="00:18:03.029" style="s2">resistance there have you ever found any</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.679" end="00:18:04.500" style="s2">success in being able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.029" end="00:18:07.130" style="s2">productive conversation with someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.500" end="00:18:12.090" style="s2">like that as time has gone by I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.130" end="00:18:13.860" style="s2">learnt more and more I engage in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.090" end="00:18:15.929" style="s2">of unproductive conversations and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.860" end="00:18:17.880" style="s2">sure a lot of people listening right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.929" end="00:18:19.830" style="s2">probably have that same experience I</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.880" end="00:18:21.269" style="s2">think Facebook has done done a scene on</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.830" end="00:18:23.730" style="s2">that a little bit you get in there on</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.269" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">Facebook yeah yes less so now because</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.730" end="00:18:28.860" style="s2">I&#39;m realizing that what we do when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:30.360" style="s2">engage somebody with a novel idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.860" end="00:18:32.610" style="s2">that they already have a preconceived</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.360" end="00:18:34.139" style="s2">idea about is that no matter no matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.610" end="00:18:35.700" style="s2">how much you wanted to bait it and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.139" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">think you&#39;re logical and being rational</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.700" end="00:18:39.809" style="s2">and you&#39;re using evidence and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:43.289" style="s2">blah it actually in grains their idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.809" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">more because it creates this this</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.289" end="00:18:47.309" style="s2">defensive dynamic and people put up a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">wall and people don&#39;t want to discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.309" end="00:18:49.860" style="s2">further because they&#39;ve already got this</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:51.929" style="s2">pre concern</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.860" end="00:18:53.940" style="s2">notion of it so it&#39;s highly emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.929" end="00:18:55.590" style="s2">charged especially on emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.940" end="00:18:57.150" style="s2">charged issues and drugs are one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.590" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">those emotionally charged issues yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.150" end="00:19:01.080" style="s2">because of a hundred years of also</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:03.960" style="s2">prohibition and the sorts of rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.080" end="00:19:07.170" style="s2">that goes out there so to engage people</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.960" end="00:19:08.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;m trying to think I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.170" end="00:19:11.100" style="s2">think of a good example so I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.910" end="00:19:11.490" style="s2">speak with my parents about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.100" end="00:19:14.490" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.490" end="00:19:16.110" style="s2">neither of them mum is not even a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.490" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">drinker for example she&#39;s not somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.110" end="00:19:20.760" style="s2">that imbibes in these things at all but</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:22.980" style="s2">she does have a framework of you know it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.760" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">looked into and experimented with like</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.980" end="00:19:27.090" style="s2">wicker and these sorts of things before</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:29.040" style="s2">so she&#39;s got a minor framework and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.090" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">a writer so she&#39;s got that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.040" end="00:19:33.299" style="s2">framework that I can start to frame</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:35.580" style="s2">discussions around what the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.299" end="00:19:37.350" style="s2">experience is to her with my dad he</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.580" end="00:19:38.700" style="s2">apparently he had tried something many</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.350" end="00:19:41.820" style="s2">many years ago when he was a you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.700" end="00:19:43.950" style="s2">teenager or 20s or whatever so he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.820" end="00:19:45.540" style="s2">a mild framework again but he didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.950" end="00:19:47.490" style="s2">far he saw some bad things with his</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.540" end="00:19:48.840" style="s2">friends so that&#39;s he&#39;s you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.490" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">what he&#39;s seen and I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.840" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">people also have that experience they</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:54.450" style="s2">might have seen some strange experiences</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:56.730" style="s2">I think this happens a lot at festivals</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.450" end="00:19:59.580" style="s2">where people will decide to take a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.730" end="00:20:02.100" style="s2">psychedelic substance LSD or whatever at</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.580" end="00:20:03.750" style="s2">the first festival that they go to and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.100" end="00:20:04.590" style="s2">this is the first psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.750" end="00:20:07.470" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.590" end="00:20:09.210" style="s2">combination for disaster yeah like if</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.470" end="00:20:11.490" style="s2">somebody doesn&#39;t understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.210" end="00:20:13.290" style="s2">psychedelic space is going to be like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.490" end="00:20:15.390" style="s2">mean people can have great times too but</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.290" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen plenty of people not have</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.390" end="00:20:20.040" style="s2">great times and then them and their</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.580" end="00:20:22.380" style="s2">friends decide oh well you know LSD</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.040" end="00:20:24.450" style="s2">makes you mad and they&#39;ll make a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.380" end="00:20:25.770" style="s2">emotionally charged decision based on</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.450" end="00:20:29.040" style="s2">that one experience that one</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.770" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">ill-informed and arguably you know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.040" end="00:20:32.100" style="s2">somebody had had have talked to them</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:34.169" style="s2">about it they was gone hey maybe try it</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.100" end="00:20:37.410" style="s2">at home with like a good friend and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.169" end="00:20:39.210" style="s2">know so you need to push past barriers</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.410" end="00:20:42.120" style="s2">that might actually be ingrained because</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.210" end="00:20:44.130" style="s2">somebody had a bad experience once or</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.120" end="00:20:45.990" style="s2">saw a friend with a bad experience or</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.130" end="00:20:49.590" style="s2">those sorts of tau so it&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.990" end="00:20:52.860" style="s2">emotional so to get past that I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.590" end="00:20:55.500" style="s2">I mean just being honest but not pushy</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.860" end="00:20:57.750" style="s2">not being a preacher not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.500" end="00:20:59.340" style="s2">dominate conversations with stories of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.750" end="00:21:01.290" style="s2">psychedelia you don&#39;t want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.340" end="00:21:03.680" style="s2">psychedelic zealot we&#39;ve had those</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.290" end="00:21:06.020" style="s2">before in the past</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.680" end="00:21:08.120" style="s2">I think that is what undid part well</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.020" end="00:21:09.980" style="s2">that&#39;s one part one small part of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.120" end="00:21:11.720" style="s2">puzzle that undid what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.980" end="00:21:14.540" style="s2">original countercultural movement in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.720" end="00:21:15.710" style="s2">US and in Australia in 60s and 70s but</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.540" end="00:21:18.020" style="s2">there was a lot of other stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.710" end="00:21:20.060" style="s2">as well but speak your truth quietly and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.020" end="00:21:22.040" style="s2">clearly I guess and listen listen to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.060" end="00:21:24.200" style="s2">others about these things and and if</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.040" end="00:21:26.900" style="s2">it&#39;s an emotional discussion which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.200" end="00:21:29.120" style="s2">inevitably going to be stop trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.900" end="00:21:30.470" style="s2">for evidence and facts and give them</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.120" end="00:21:31.910" style="s2">this journal in that journal but if it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.470" end="00:21:33.950" style="s2">is that kind of discussion give them</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.910" end="00:21:36.200" style="s2">that and you can probably have two parts</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.950" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">of that discussion like at different</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.200" end="00:21:40.130" style="s2">times with the same person say every now</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">and then you can give them some evidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.130" end="00:21:42.740" style="s2">and say hey check out this article if</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that they want to engage</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.740" end="00:21:46.250" style="s2">and then give them the emotional story</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:48.230" style="s2">of our well here&#39;s this experience that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.250" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">I had or you know my friend was talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.230" end="00:21:53.690" style="s2">about this later so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:56.930" style="s2">and it&#39;s a longer journey than a face</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.690" end="00:21:58.730" style="s2">book no that&#39;s a very great answer so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.930" end="00:22:00.200" style="s2">was just about to go and introduce what</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.730" end="00:22:01.460" style="s2">you&#39;re doing with 3cr or what have you</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.200" end="00:22:03.260" style="s2">because I have a question that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.460" end="00:22:04.820" style="s2">follows on from it but maybe maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.260" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">should maybe you should tell us what</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.820" end="00:22:08.210" style="s2">three CCR&#39;s about and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:10.520" style="s2">currently involved in that yeah so 3cr</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.210" end="00:22:12.380" style="s2">is one of Milburn&#39;s community radio</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.520" end="00:22:14.510" style="s2">stations I&#39;ve actually come to find that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.380" end="00:22:16.940" style="s2">Australia has a really vibrant community</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.510" end="00:22:18.380" style="s2">radio community culture which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.940" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">exist in a lot of other countries to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.380" end="00:22:22.550" style="s2">this extent so that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:25.100" style="s2">should be thankful for 3cr is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.550" end="00:22:27.920" style="s2">traditionally your activist tea lefties</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.100" end="00:22:31.130" style="s2">sort of nest and they&#39;re rabble rousers</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.920" end="00:22:32.450" style="s2">by by tradition I suppose so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.130" end="00:22:34.610" style="s2">sort of contextualized with this I</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.450" end="00:22:36.290" style="s2">started doing a radio show called sorry</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.610" end="00:22:39.020" style="s2">a podcast called in psychedelia right</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.290" end="00:22:41.480" style="s2">back in 2012 and I did a few episodes of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.020" end="00:22:42.950" style="s2">it and then a life happened and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.480" end="00:22:44.690" style="s2">do other stuff and I decided I wanted it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.950" end="00:22:46.940" style="s2">on the radio but the broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.690" end="00:22:48.590" style="s2">services act in Australia stipulates</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.940" end="00:22:50.870" style="s2">that you are not among other things you</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.590" end="00:22:52.820" style="s2">are not allowed to be seen to promote</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.870" end="00:22:54.350" style="s2">illicit drug use okay right so what does</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.820" end="00:22:57.050" style="s2">that mean what is it to promote illicit</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.350" end="00:22:59.030" style="s2">drug use well in some contexts some</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.050" end="00:23:01.190" style="s2">people have tried to frame an honest</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.030" end="00:23:03.950" style="s2">discussion about positive negative</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.190" end="00:23:07.010" style="s2">effects about an experience as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.950" end="00:23:09.620" style="s2">that&#39;s promoting drug use so we had to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.010" end="00:23:11.240" style="s2">be very careful in and there&#39;s a line</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.620" end="00:23:13.370" style="s2">that we still have to walk we still have</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.240" end="00:23:16.730" style="s2">to be very careful this is also by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.370" end="00:23:17.650" style="s2">way why most newspaper TV and radio</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.730" end="00:23:20.410" style="s2">stories you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.650" end="00:23:22.630" style="s2">drugs will almost inherently have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.410" end="00:23:25.090" style="s2">negative bias because they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.630" end="00:23:27.070" style="s2">basically held to that by not only the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.090" end="00:23:29.230" style="s2">broadcasting Services Act that I often</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.070" end="00:23:31.540" style="s2">buy their own internal rules and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.230" end="00:23:34.330" style="s2">regulations too but what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.540" end="00:23:37.030" style="s2">with in psychedelia is is push this and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.330" end="00:23:39.130" style="s2">be radically honest I suppose and start</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.030" end="00:23:40.660" style="s2">telling the stories of the community of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.130" end="00:23:42.580" style="s2">people who take drugs which guess what</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.550" end="00:24:01.870" style="s2">within them and I don&#39;t think the answer</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.980" end="00:24:04.360" style="s2">is to go I&#39;ll well throw it out you know</p>

<p begin="00:25:05.800" end="00:25:09.670" style="s2">finding out it&#39;s a lot of work to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.270" end="00:25:12.910" style="s2">these things done oh yeah good time big</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.670" end="00:25:16.120" style="s2">time so I&#39;m slowly getting the well the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.910" end="00:25:20.350" style="s2">picture of what might be driving you but</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.120" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">I wonder could you tell me what so many</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.350" end="00:25:23.740" style="s2">different ways we could go at this but</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:26.260" style="s2">just very broadly what&#39;s driving you and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.740" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">then how is that hitting the world in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:30.430" style="s2">terms of the actions you&#39;re taking is it</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.680" style="s2">occurring at this more trying to affect</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.430" end="00:25:34.770" style="s2">some sort of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.680" end="00:25:36.270" style="s2">change their because you know talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.770" end="00:25:38.340" style="s2">about legal issues here talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.270" end="00:25:41.970" style="s2">how psychedelics affect society</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.340" end="00:25:43.920" style="s2">community radio is certainly more seems</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.970" end="00:25:45.740" style="s2">like slightly more part of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.920" end="00:25:48.930" style="s2">culture than podcasts are for instance</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.740" end="00:25:50.340" style="s2">so you you&#39;re hitting up against you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.930" end="00:25:52.620" style="s2">trying to hit up against where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.340" end="00:25:54.090" style="s2">actual concrete walls are to having</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.620" end="00:25:56.610" style="s2">these discussions and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.090" end="00:25:59.490" style="s2">see where the appropriate places are to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.610" end="00:26:01.290" style="s2">try and move the move the border a</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.490" end="00:26:03.240" style="s2">little bit in a way that makes dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.290" end="00:26:04.920" style="s2">and possible it seems to be the sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.240" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">I&#39;m getting so what&#39;s driving you and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.920" end="00:26:06.660" style="s2">then how&#39;s that hitting hitting the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:09.210" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.660" end="00:26:12.150" style="s2">I think I&#39;m driven by this obsession</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:14.490" style="s2">with again like the abstract the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.150" end="00:26:16.140" style="s2">in the world that that there isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.490" end="00:26:17.820" style="s2">answer out there and that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.140" end="00:26:19.470" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but there&#39;s lots of answers</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.820" end="00:26:21.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just that every answer is a new</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.470" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">question and and something about like</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.510" end="00:26:25.980" style="s2">the first time I had a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.630" style="s2">substance which was mushrooms I&#39;ve eaten</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.980" end="00:26:29.100" style="s2">some mushrooms and ended up rolling</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.630" end="00:26:31.020" style="s2">around in the bush or whatever but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.100" end="00:26:32.220" style="s2">just had this this thought over and over</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.020" end="00:26:34.260" style="s2">and over and I think it&#39;s really stuck</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.220" end="00:26:36.870" style="s2">with me that I was at this this edge</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.260" end="00:26:39.690" style="s2">point and just over and over thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.870" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">I&#39;m at the edge and it was this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.690" end="00:26:44.670" style="s2">maniacal kind of realization like why</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:48.690" style="s2">die as I&#39;m at the edge of I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.670" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">know what I&#39;m talking about even but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.690" end="00:26:55.080" style="s2">think that as time has progressed that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.980" end="00:26:57.240" style="s2">edge feels like where we are at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.080" end="00:26:59.250" style="s2">times we&#39;re always at the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.240" end="00:27:01.020" style="s2">precipice of the moment we&#39;re never in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.250" end="00:27:03.150" style="s2">the past or the future were always</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.020" end="00:27:05.040" style="s2">slinging through this moment moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.150" end="00:27:08.190" style="s2">moment moment over and over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.040" end="00:27:09.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s building up so I obsess about</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.190" end="00:27:14.610" style="s2">these kind of stuff and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.900" end="00:27:16.740" style="s2">drives this desire to shift the way and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.610" end="00:27:20.030" style="s2">I&#39;m dream and be here so I try not to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.740" end="00:27:22.800" style="s2">look too like delusional grandeur vision</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.030" end="00:27:24.870" style="s2">we need to the world is not going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.800" end="00:27:26.790" style="s2">continue operating on the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.870" end="00:27:28.890" style="s2">capitalists dream and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.790" end="00:27:31.290" style="s2">sound like a you know socialist nut bag</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.890" end="00:27:33.540" style="s2">here I&#39;m but the the capitalist regime</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.290" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">is over it&#39;s done it&#39;s done it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.540" end="00:27:37.800" style="s2">its job I think in the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:40.440" style="s2">currently operates and we need to change</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.800" end="00:27:43.380" style="s2">how we structure this world and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.440" end="00:27:44.550" style="s2">think that can happen until we change</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.380" end="00:27:45.270" style="s2">what we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.550" end="00:27:48.180" style="s2">I think we</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.270" end="00:27:50.610" style="s2">might be seeing the process of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.180" end="00:27:53.490" style="s2">happening right in front of us that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.610" end="00:27:56.760" style="s2">are not I mean what is it to be human</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.490" end="00:28:00.920" style="s2">now is it is our technology part of us</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.760" end="00:28:04.440" style="s2">in some ways I mean if we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.920" end="00:28:06.360" style="s2">language as a sort of primal technology</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.440" end="00:28:08.910" style="s2">the ability for me to transmit what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.360" end="00:28:11.280" style="s2">going on inside my brain into your brain</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.910" end="00:28:14.820" style="s2">is pretty incredible but now we can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.280" end="00:28:18.060" style="s2">this in this like highly engrossing ful</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.820" end="00:28:19.620" style="s2">fully sensory engrossing way with with</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.060" end="00:28:21.810" style="s2">virtual reality and things like that but</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.620" end="00:28:23.400" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we quite I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.810" end="00:28:25.950" style="s2">gonna make a lot of mistakes if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.400" end="00:28:29.250" style="s2">think hard about what it is we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.950" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">how how we structure things and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.250" end="00:28:32.760" style="s2">leaving something out of the picture</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:33.720" style="s2">yeah I think we probably are leaving</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.760" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">something out of the picture because</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.720" end="00:28:39.420" style="s2">we&#39;re going round and round and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:43.080" style="s2">some in this value game that we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.420" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">know the scarcity game where in many</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.080" end="00:28:47.100" style="s2">places scarcity doesn&#39;t exist so we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">to artificially create an in which case</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.100" end="00:28:52.230" style="s2">not the Helloween why are we doing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:54.030" style="s2">we don&#39;t trust each other and why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.230" end="00:28:55.980" style="s2">we trust each other and I understand why</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.030" end="00:28:57.570" style="s2">we don&#39;t trust each other because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.980" end="00:28:59.640" style="s2">you were just telling me a story earlier</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.570" end="00:29:01.410" style="s2">about a bunch of guys who had stolen a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.640" end="00:29:03.810" style="s2">bunch of guns just quite near you and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.410" end="00:29:04.980" style="s2">you know people are up to up to strange</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.810" end="00:29:06.540" style="s2">things but I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.980" end="00:29:07.920" style="s2">what the answer to this isn&#39;t but I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.540" end="00:29:10.170" style="s2">think that it&#39;s important that we bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.920" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">the psychoactive the altered worlds back</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.170" end="00:29:13.800" style="s2">into the equation that we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:15.720" style="s2">stigmatizing these altered states that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.800" end="00:29:18.120" style="s2">we actually start to try and understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.720" end="00:29:21.270" style="s2">why they happen not just the the drug</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.120" end="00:29:23.130" style="s2">experiences - but my favorite authors I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.270" end="00:29:25.530" style="s2">suppose is Oliver Sacks who has written</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.130" end="00:29:28.200" style="s2">fantastic things about all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.530" end="00:29:30.180" style="s2">strange altered states that people have</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.580" end="00:29:35.670" style="s2">felt it was very helpful for him to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.470" end="00:29:38.190" style="s2">taken a variety of psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.670" end="00:29:41.010" style="s2">substances because he felt like he could</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.190" end="00:29:43.650" style="s2">see into some of these worlds and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.010" end="00:29:45.570" style="s2">think they&#39;re a fantastic tool as</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.650" end="00:29:47.430" style="s2">psychedelics especially a her a tool</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.570" end="00:29:49.470" style="s2">that can be used by not just the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.430" end="00:29:51.870" style="s2">psychonaut but the Philosopher&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.470" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">mystic and the scientist alike these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.870" end="00:29:56.280" style="s2">something where we can find this strange</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:58.040" style="s2">space and ask what what is it saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.280" end="00:30:00.470" style="s2">about who we are and what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.040" end="00:30:01.850" style="s2">as a creature in this world and what I</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.470" end="00:30:04.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know there&#39;s some big questions</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.850" end="00:30:06.170" style="s2">that I&#39;m probably ranting and rambling a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.070" end="00:30:07.970" style="s2">little bit here but yeah well look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.170" end="00:30:10.700" style="s2">all very interesting I mean I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.970" end="00:30:14.270" style="s2">the place where we can fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.700" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">agree is that honest conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.270" end="00:30:19.880" style="s2">things that are powerful need to take</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:23.090" style="s2">place I mean I can&#39;t think of anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.880" end="00:30:24.440" style="s2">more necessary than that really well but</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.090" end="00:30:27.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t talk about religion and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.440" end="00:30:28.490" style="s2">politics at the table right yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.350" end="00:30:30.500" style="s2">difficult for me because I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.490" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">been someone to talk about that at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.500" end="00:30:34.370" style="s2">table I think is the most important</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">conversations we should be shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.370" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">forgetting them and people just do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:40.820" style="s2">for the sake of keeping face with their</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:43.220" style="s2">crazy uncle or whatever well I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.820" end="00:30:44.600" style="s2">you whatever could motivate someone to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.220" end="00:30:47.060" style="s2">try and have conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.600" end="00:30:48.920" style="s2">psychedelic experience is I think a deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.060" end="00:30:50.750" style="s2">point of connection between people even</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.920" end="00:30:53.030" style="s2">if it might not be the easiest thing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.750" end="00:30:56.780" style="s2">put into words you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.030" end="00:31:00.590" style="s2">certain states of experience therein</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.780" end="00:31:04.070" style="s2">that are self-evidently important enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.590" end="00:31:05.750" style="s2">to attempt to relate cohesively to your</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.070" end="00:31:08.360" style="s2">life and the lives of people around you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.750" end="00:31:13.160" style="s2">as it&#39;s just a very as a very basic</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.360" end="00:31:14.690" style="s2">thing but I am concerned about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.160" end="00:31:16.850" style="s2">know I always have this idea I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.690" end="00:31:19.130" style="s2">classically British in this way and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.850" end="00:31:23.150" style="s2">partly because I heard a international</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.130" end="00:31:24.950" style="s2">relations lecture I had in 2010 say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.150" end="00:31:26.510" style="s2">the English way in his version of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.950" end="00:31:28.820" style="s2">International Relations I was always</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.510" end="00:31:32.780" style="s2">trying to find the middle road but for</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.820" end="00:31:35.450" style="s2">me I have I think quite I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.780" end="00:31:39.160" style="s2">quite important to keep psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.450" end="00:31:42.740" style="s2">as a broad domain of inquiry that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.160" end="00:31:46.340" style="s2">interdisciplinary and that doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.740" end="00:31:50.870" style="s2">too attached to one or another political</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.340" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">motive or religion necessarily don&#39;t box</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.870" end="00:31:55.520" style="s2">that up as something that&#39;s only helpful</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:57.730" style="s2">for therapy even though that&#39;s seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.520" end="00:31:59.930" style="s2">the the most appropriate way to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.730" end="00:32:02.180" style="s2">psychedelics with an evidence-based</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.930" end="00:32:04.730" style="s2">approach behind it through the door so</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.180" end="00:32:06.170" style="s2">it&#39;s important to kind of to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.730" end="00:32:09.310" style="s2">have a conversation about some of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.170" end="00:32:11.600" style="s2">things without lots of the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.310" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">problems that we might have to take</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.600" end="00:32:18.919" style="s2">certain broad economic or ideological</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:21.289" style="s2">positions about even though there are of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.919" end="00:32:23.690" style="s2">course interesting reasons to try and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.289" end="00:32:26.410" style="s2">bring some of these things together it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.690" end="00:32:29.720" style="s2">is something that I do have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.410" end="00:32:31.730" style="s2">animosity BIA okay yeah or just a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.720" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2">concern about I&#39;m trying to turn a</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.730" end="00:32:35.390" style="s2">figure that what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.950" end="00:32:36.650" style="s2">something that I&#39;m I feel concerned</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.390" end="00:32:38.870" style="s2">about and I think a lot of other people</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.650" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">feel concerned about too because if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.870" end="00:32:43.100" style="s2">do change the status quo which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:44.600" style="s2">prohibition and I think that does need</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.100" end="00:32:46.730" style="s2">to change because I&#39;ve heard too many</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.600" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">stories of people&#39;s lives being torn</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.730" end="00:32:50.450" style="s2">apart by prohibition and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:53.240" style="s2">sometimes just just on that point</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.450" end="00:32:54.620" style="s2">sometimes people say oh we need to keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.240" end="00:32:56.120" style="s2">it this way because it kind of keeps it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.620" end="00:32:57.650" style="s2">secret and we don&#39;t want the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.120" end="00:32:59.900" style="s2">to get a blah blah blah all of this sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.650" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">of stuff and I&#39;d say yeah I sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.900" end="00:33:04.909" style="s2">your point but you know you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:06.409" style="s2">killing off half you know a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.909" end="00:33:08.600" style="s2">people you forgetting the the less</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.409" end="00:33:10.070" style="s2">advantaged people you&#39;re forgetting I</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.600" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">guess that you might be in a more</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.070" end="00:33:13.669" style="s2">privileged position or maybe you just</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:14.840" style="s2">haven&#39;t run up against some of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.669" end="00:33:17.330" style="s2">problems that other people run up</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.840" end="00:33:20.210" style="s2">against so I think prohibition has to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.330" end="00:33:22.490" style="s2">but I mean with the medical thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.210" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">going on one of the the fears that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.490" end="00:33:26.990" style="s2">have is that could it get locked into</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:28.190" style="s2">this idea as this kind of I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.990" end="00:33:30.860" style="s2">think it will because I think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.190" end="00:33:32.990" style="s2">experience itself sort of necessitates</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.860" end="00:33:34.429" style="s2">breaking out of the box in many ways but</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.990" end="00:33:36.140" style="s2">then there&#39;s a lot of power in that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.429" end="00:33:38.840" style="s2">people could put that back into the box</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.140" end="00:33:42.380" style="s2">but yeah it is a bit you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.840" end="00:33:44.750" style="s2">it being caught up in that frame workers</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.380" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">or you know this is a medicine for sick</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.750" end="00:33:48.770" style="s2">people and then sick people are people</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">that we can measure certain sicknesses</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.770" end="00:33:52.340" style="s2">of and you know that sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:54.500" style="s2">then you wouldn&#39;t want something like an</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.340" end="00:33:56.299" style="s2">alcohol or tobacco industry for</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.500" end="00:33:58.789" style="s2">psychedelics because then it becomes all</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.299" end="00:34:01.070" style="s2">this like lobbying crony capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.789" end="00:34:03.409" style="s2">nonsense that goes on which is the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.070" end="00:34:05.390" style="s2">game we&#39;re playing now I mean how would</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.409" end="00:34:07.280" style="s2">you do it you don&#39;t want it just some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.390" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">the plays in in the u.s. like Santo</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.280" end="00:34:12.500" style="s2">Daime a and you DV I don&#39;t know a whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:13.879" style="s2">lot about them but something in me goes</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.500" end="00:34:16.070" style="s2">well I wouldn&#39;t want to have to join</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.879" end="00:34:18.770" style="s2">some religious group to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.070" end="00:34:20.210" style="s2">experience these things either so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.770" end="00:34:22.310" style="s2">what are we left with you almost have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.210" end="00:34:25.250" style="s2">come up with some kind of benevolent in</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.310" end="00:34:27.950" style="s2">inherently democratic organization whose</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.250" end="00:34:29.480" style="s2">so goals and values are using the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.950" end="00:34:31.580" style="s2">money that it gets from selling these</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.480" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">substances to just put back into itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.580" end="00:34:36.830" style="s2">and build honorary places for people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:38.570" style="s2">go into art or sit and like a secular</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:40.490" style="s2">religion of sorts you know religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.570" end="00:34:42.379" style="s2">without all the the hangups but then</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.490" end="00:34:44.659" style="s2">does that then get that maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.379" end="00:34:46.610" style="s2">missing my own hangups yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.659" end="00:34:48.200" style="s2">a hard question absolutely I think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.610" end="00:34:50.510" style="s2">is one of the questions I think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.200" end="00:34:52.190" style="s2">Mohsen and ends up being the place where</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.510" end="00:34:53.600" style="s2">a lot of conversations I have with</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.190" end="00:34:55.159" style="s2">people that are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.600" end="00:34:57.320" style="s2">psychedelics ends up going it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.159" end="00:34:59.570" style="s2">fundamentally about what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.320" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">cultural structure allows the proper</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.570" end="00:35:04.600" style="s2">integration of altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:07.670" style="s2">consciousness into our current life and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.600" end="00:35:11.540" style="s2">that also has to take into account where</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.670" end="00:35:14.630" style="s2">our current society is at and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.540" end="00:35:17.840" style="s2">to me at least the main impetus of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.630" end="00:35:20.750" style="s2">change towards nothing more than the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.840" end="00:35:22.310" style="s2">ability to engage honestly about altered</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.750" end="00:35:24.680" style="s2">states of experience and how they relate</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.310" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">to meaning it needs to be one that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.680" end="00:35:27.980" style="s2">happens on an individual level I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:30.290" style="s2">because I do think that&#39;s just such a</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.980" end="00:35:32.450" style="s2">massive danger with one particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.290" end="00:35:34.700" style="s2">overarching system trying to set the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.450" end="00:35:36.140" style="s2">tone for how these experiences gets</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.700" end="00:35:38.090" style="s2">created yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.140" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">but nevertheless that the structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.090" end="00:35:42.850" style="s2">there does well that you do need a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:45.530" style="s2">structure in order to orient I mean look</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.850" end="00:35:47.240" style="s2">so this is I think a question that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.530" end="00:35:51.140" style="s2">different religions have grappled with</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.240" end="00:35:53.890" style="s2">and put rather mystically its what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.140" end="00:35:56.840" style="s2">appropriate hierarchical structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.890" end="00:35:59.960" style="s2">between hell and heaven or from them or</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.840" end="00:36:03.230" style="s2">from the man on the ground up to God you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.960" end="00:36:05.570" style="s2">know it might not be appropriate for I</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.230" end="00:36:07.220" style="s2">mean it would it would be I think quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.570" end="00:36:09.320" style="s2">ridiculous actually for us to go to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.220" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">where we&#39;re at right now to suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.320" end="00:36:14.060" style="s2">whoever our that 15 most important</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.220" end="00:36:19.460" style="s2">all just decided all right that&#39;s it all</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.900" end="00:36:21.410" style="s2">psychedelics are legal and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.460" end="00:36:22.850" style="s2">bloody fund it with two billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.410" end="00:36:24.200" style="s2">some ridiculous thought experiment all</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.850" end="00:36:25.730" style="s2">of a sudden something changes tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.200" end="00:36:27.770" style="s2">and everyone can have access to these</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.730" end="00:36:30.980" style="s2">things well I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.770" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">for that no and so threatened SETI right</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.980" end="00:36:35.890" style="s2">absolutely absolutely but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">time without a proper degree of</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.890" end="00:36:41.540" style="s2">democratization of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:45.770" style="s2">path towards something that fills this</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.540" end="00:36:47.840" style="s2">divine part of the human potential well</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.770" end="00:36:50.450" style="s2">I mean there has to be an element of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.840" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">democracy to that the path because if</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.450" end="00:36:53.990" style="s2">there is such a thing as a pastor</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:56.420" style="s2">divinity if just put in a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.990" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">metaphorical sense it&#39;s because every</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.420" end="00:37:01.400" style="s2">human being has that in in their very</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.980" style="s2">essence fundamentally and so to deny</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.400" end="00:37:05.630" style="s2">that possibility to anybody is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.980" end="00:37:08.450" style="s2">one of the one of the greatest crimes</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.630" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">you could ever possibly do and is surely</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.450" end="00:37:12.109" style="s2">the mark of a civilization in decay or</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:13.730" style="s2">going the wrong way and there could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.109" end="00:37:15.290" style="s2">many things that are that of course yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.730" end="00:37:18.109" style="s2">I mean I suppose that you know I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.290" end="00:37:20.570" style="s2">questions rumbling around my head of how</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.109" end="00:37:22.580" style="s2">what prohibition is all about is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.570" end="00:37:24.710" style="s2">really about the things that we&#39;ve sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.580" end="00:37:26.119" style="s2">of I mean it&#39;s obviously not the things</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.710" end="00:37:27.890" style="s2">that are at the top level that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.119" end="00:37:29.750" style="s2">heard about and we know that it was used</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.890" end="00:37:31.820" style="s2">for scapegoating a lot of the time but</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.750" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">there are other reasons as well I get</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.820" end="00:37:36.260" style="s2">into this space where I have I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:38.750" style="s2">skimming the tip of our iceberg on this</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.260" end="00:37:41.380" style="s2">sort of information and and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.750" end="00:37:44.150" style="s2">can seem to get very conspiratorial and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.380" end="00:37:46.730" style="s2">and bizarre soon so you know grain</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.150" end="00:37:48.740" style="s2">assault here but the psychedelics didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.730" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">get discovered this century or last</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.740" end="00:37:54.380" style="s2">century it&#39;s not an experience that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:57.170" style="s2">been unknown and even not to Western</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.380" end="00:37:59.090" style="s2">civilization you you go back to the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.170" end="00:38:03.050" style="s2">ancient Greeks and you might be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.090" end="00:38:06.920" style="s2">with clack Eon and Aleph Seon mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.050" end="00:38:08.650" style="s2">mysteries mysteries and some speculation</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.920" end="00:38:10.520" style="s2">that there might have been some other</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.650" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">psychoactive compounds there and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.520" end="00:38:14.840" style="s2">seems even that a lot of the alcoholic</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:17.330" style="s2">who were supposed alcoholic drinks over</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.840" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">the many millennia had a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.330" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">other plants in them with a whole range</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:26.210" style="s2">of other things and we know that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:27.859" style="s2">were orders of people the apothecaries</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.210" end="00:38:29.600" style="s2">was sort of the more recent ones I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.859" end="00:38:31.160" style="s2">suppose but going back I can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.600" end="00:38:33.260" style="s2">all the names of these people but there</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.160" end="00:38:35.420" style="s2">is this this mixing of you know magic</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.260" end="00:38:36.890" style="s2">and science are the same sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.420" end="00:38:39.830" style="s2">they came from the same places</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.890" end="00:38:42.530" style="s2">philosophy and underpins these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.830" end="00:38:44.630" style="s2">it&#39;s really all intertwined intertwine</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.530" end="00:38:46.790" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s only been recently we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.630" end="00:38:49.130" style="s2">gone and divided them out but you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.790" end="00:38:50.869" style="s2">it used to be the the magic people that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.130" end="00:38:51.650" style="s2">you would go to to help do these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.869" end="00:38:53.120" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.650" end="00:38:54.950" style="s2">do you start to wonder because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.120" end="00:38:57.860" style="s2">so much power in it and power in these</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.950" end="00:38:59.660" style="s2">altered experiences and and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.860" end="00:39:03.170" style="s2">the mystery is is a powerful thing as</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.660" end="00:39:05.150" style="s2">well if someone or group or maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.170" end="00:39:07.010" style="s2">people just decided it independently of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.150" end="00:39:09.830" style="s2">each other kind of went hang on if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.010" end="00:39:11.660" style="s2">having people accessing these states</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.830" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">these places that we know about and if</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.660" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">they figure out how to use them</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:18.050" style="s2">well then we might not be able to play</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:20.060" style="s2">our little game about you know scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.050" end="00:39:21.890" style="s2">and and making money from them and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.060" end="00:39:23.960" style="s2">and you know essentially keeping you</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.890" end="00:39:25.700" style="s2">your stock to make money from and grow</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.960" end="00:39:27.800" style="s2">in power and that kind you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.700" end="00:39:29.660" style="s2">that seems to be the game so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.800" end="00:39:31.820" style="s2">know as I said grain of salt with this</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.660" end="00:39:33.740" style="s2">with this stuff because I&#39;m hobbling it</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.820" end="00:39:35.480" style="s2">together from all sorts of places and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.740" end="00:39:37.160" style="s2">listen to a lot of things and read a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.480" end="00:39:39.080" style="s2">of things and almost immediately forget</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.160" end="00:39:40.670" style="s2">who the author was or whatever&#39;s I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.080" end="00:39:42.380" style="s2">quote it at you but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.670" end="00:39:46.370" style="s2">something else something strange going</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.380" end="00:39:47.600" style="s2">on and the worlds there unlocked by some</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.370" end="00:39:50.120" style="s2">of the psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.600" end="00:39:52.940" style="s2">especially things like DMT and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.120" end="00:39:55.190" style="s2">the the the whole acacia question in</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.940" end="00:39:57.020" style="s2">Australia has me really like intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.190" end="00:39:59.030" style="s2">and puzzled there seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.020" end="00:40:01.730" style="s2">deep in that because it&#39;s also a tree</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.030" end="00:40:04.130" style="s2">that turns up in the Quran and the Torah</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.730" end="00:40:06.590" style="s2">and you know in these ancient Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.130" end="00:40:08.600" style="s2">texts where these people weren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.590" end="00:40:10.460" style="s2">dogmatic people we see today as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.600" end="00:40:13.100" style="s2">majority of the followers of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.460" end="00:40:15.260" style="s2">religions seems like these were you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.100" end="00:40:17.120" style="s2">these were the the magic people the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.260" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">mystics that the March either whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.120" end="00:40:21.590" style="s2">you want to call them who were having</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:23.240" style="s2">these strange experiences and dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.590" end="00:40:26.030" style="s2">whole new worlds and I think we might be</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.240" end="00:40:28.280" style="s2">living in one of them hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.030" end="00:40:31.670" style="s2">interesting well what would you say has</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.280" end="00:40:33.500" style="s2">been the most impactful or strange</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.670" end="00:40:35.780" style="s2">experience you&#39;ve had with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.500" end="00:40:41.060" style="s2">psychedelic of your choice there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.780" end="00:40:43.250" style="s2">a whole handful of strange ones trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.060" end="00:40:44.810" style="s2">to remember them sometimes I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.250" end="00:40:47.840" style="s2">is trying to remember a dream and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.810" end="00:40:50.120" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;m bitten or slash slightly</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.840" end="00:40:51.980" style="s2">suspicious of how well some people can</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.120" end="00:40:55.220" style="s2">recollect certain psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.980" end="00:40:56.810" style="s2">experiences either they&#39;re really good</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.220" end="00:40:58.700" style="s2">at remembering that or they&#39;re filling</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.810" end="00:41:01.190" style="s2">in some gaps later when they&#39;re sober to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:03.240" style="s2">make it you know an Isis story to tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.190" end="00:41:06.610" style="s2">so I&#39;ve had a number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.240" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">interesting experiences or inspiring or</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.610" end="00:41:11.560" style="s2">reverent in some way and some because</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:14.110" style="s2">they were hellish and yeah I had had a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.560" end="00:41:16.030" style="s2">lesson to throw at me ah one that I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.110" end="00:41:18.520" style="s2">quite fond of which was just rather</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.030" end="00:41:20.470" style="s2">banal really but I think it was one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.520" end="00:41:23.320" style="s2">the first times I&#39;d had acid with some</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.470" end="00:41:25.210" style="s2">friends and said a beach town and won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.320" end="00:41:27.400" style="s2">sort of mentioned places but you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.210" end="00:41:29.740" style="s2">got lots of lovely beaches around and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.400" end="00:41:31.690" style="s2">just had a good night of what do we do I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.740" end="00:41:33.700" style="s2">found all the chairs in the house and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.690" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">and and stacked them into one doorway</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.700" end="00:41:37.810" style="s2">and it was very satisfied with that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">laughed at some hotdogs in some water</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.760" end="00:44:58.740" style="s2">words but feel somehow filled with a</p>

<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:09.240" style="s2">think that maybe it&#39;s important just now</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.170" end="00:49:11.370" style="s2">to mention that all the great talk</p>

<p begin="00:49:18.870" end="00:49:23.490" style="s2">in a way that kind of concerns me we</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.150" end="00:49:24.900" style="s2">have people that will spend thousands of</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.120" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">authentic sorry but why was living your</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:38.820" style="s2">life not authentic I feel like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:41.250" style="s2">gone through this doublespeak thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.820" end="00:49:44.370" style="s2">where we disconnecting more trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.250" end="00:49:46.020" style="s2">connect at the same time and losing</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.370" end="00:49:47.460" style="s2">ourselves along the way because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.020" end="00:49:49.500" style="s2">forgetting that what&#39;s wrong with a</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.500" end="00:49:53.130" style="s2">mean I think there are perfectly good</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.390" end="00:49:55.020" style="s2">reasons and I&#39;m sure you agree that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.130" end="00:49:57.720" style="s2">perfectly good reasons to have an</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.020" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">experience say in Peru with shamans</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.720" end="00:50:01.590" style="s2">there no no that&#39;s not the point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:03.870" style="s2">making but I think what might be the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.590" end="00:50:07.350" style="s2">attraction of this way is that well</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.870" end="00:50:09.060" style="s2">there is a culture that has developed I</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.350" end="00:50:10.530" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I can say this for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.060" end="00:50:12.060" style="s2">purpose of being able to properly</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.530" end="00:50:15.330" style="s2">integrate these sorts of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.060" end="00:50:19.590" style="s2">right so in terms of a set and setting</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.330" end="00:50:21.330" style="s2">that has worked for various indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.590" end="00:50:23.820" style="s2">populations around the world that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.330" end="00:50:25.590" style="s2">used different plant compounds to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.820" end="00:50:27.060" style="s2">these sorts of experiences they</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.590" end="00:50:29.130" style="s2">developed a way of relating to this that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.060" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">seems to give them sustaining value in</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.130" end="00:50:33.810" style="s2">their culture and it mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:36.690" style="s2">understandable why people might feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.810" end="00:50:39.360" style="s2">like they don&#39;t have access to a place</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.690" end="00:50:41.430" style="s2">where they can authentically engage with</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.360" end="00:50:43.860" style="s2">this stuff here but in principle in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.430" end="00:50:45.750" style="s2">principle it&#39;s it&#39;s apps you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.860" end="00:50:47.970" style="s2">to go anywhere you&#39;ve got everything you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.750" end="00:50:49.619" style="s2">need right here if only you were aware</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.970" end="00:50:51.749" style="s2">of how properly to can</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.619" end="00:50:53.640" style="s2">yourself which is no face of hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.749" end="00:50:57.990" style="s2">information and I think this comes back</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.640" end="00:51:00.210" style="s2">down to questions of authority and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.990" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">legitimacy is because legitimacy is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.210" end="00:51:04.380" style="s2">funny word that pops up again in</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:06.119" style="s2">discussing drug policy and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.380" end="00:51:08.490" style="s2">the discussions in Parliament in</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.119" end="00:51:11.789" style="s2">Victoria around the drug laws that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.490" end="00:51:15.269" style="s2">have and why some of it is considered</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.789" end="00:51:16.859" style="s2">illegitimate use to use an illicit</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.269" end="00:51:18.990" style="s2">substance because there&#39;s no legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.859" end="00:51:21.210" style="s2">purpose for it if there are a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.990" end="00:51:22.740" style="s2">purpose then it wouldn&#39;t be prohibited</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.210" end="00:51:24.349" style="s2">would it right there&#39;s this strange sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.740" end="00:51:26.430" style="s2">of things so people people want</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.349" end="00:51:28.019" style="s2">legitimacy whatever this is though you</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.430" end="00:51:29.819" style="s2">know they want that that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.019" end="00:51:31.769" style="s2">think is the authenticity I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.819" end="00:51:33.299" style="s2">trick that&#39;s being played I think you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.769" end="00:51:35.400" style="s2">can make what&#39;s legitimate for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.299" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">although don&#39;t tell everybody because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.400" end="00:51:39.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know what might just all break the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:41.549" style="s2">laws or whatever I don&#39;t know you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.990" end="00:51:44.309" style="s2">precisely against the problem there</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.549" end="00:51:46.170" style="s2">which is the fact that actually we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.309" end="00:51:48.390" style="s2">doing as a society an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.170" end="00:51:51.089" style="s2">things well despite the fact that we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.390" end="00:51:54.089" style="s2">recognize a number of problems right</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.089" end="00:51:56.369" style="s2">that could be so disastrous that our</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.089" end="00:51:56.970" style="s2">civilization turns out to be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.369" end="00:51:59.730" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.970" end="00:52:02.099" style="s2">adaptive enough but at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.730" end="00:52:03.900" style="s2">you know for some people those problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.099" end="00:52:07.170" style="s2">and for most of us really those problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.900" end="00:52:08.759" style="s2">might be climate problems perhaps or the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.170" end="00:52:11.660" style="s2">development of weapons that are far too</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.759" end="00:52:14.430" style="s2">powerful for us to use or the order</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.660" end="00:52:17.160" style="s2">sequestering away of substances that</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.430" end="00:52:20.569" style="s2">have actually always perhaps been</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.160" end="00:52:23.339" style="s2">involved with an appropriate relation to</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.569" end="00:52:26.130" style="s2">spirituality odd there could be a whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.339" end="00:52:28.499" style="s2">a whole number of things but the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.130" end="00:52:30.660" style="s2">that we are doing an awful lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.499" end="00:52:32.509" style="s2">very well I think in different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.660" end="00:52:37.680" style="s2">the world and I think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.509" end="00:52:39.660" style="s2">clear and obvious positive sides to to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:41.759" style="s2">capitalism for instance which is in loot</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.660" end="00:52:43.019" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a positive and negative</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.759" end="00:52:45.059" style="s2">side of the coin there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.019" end="00:52:46.710" style="s2">when you can dream an idea and say to</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.059" end="00:52:48.180" style="s2">somebody hey I&#39;ve got this idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.710" end="00:52:50.819" style="s2">gonna be wicked you want to help me out</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.180" end="00:52:52.349" style="s2">with it that&#39;s capitalism in brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.819" end="00:52:54.180" style="s2">action right there but when you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.349" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">people saying I want to maintain my</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.180" end="00:52:58.380" style="s2">profit margin so you politician friend</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.450" style="s2">can you make some regulations that block</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.380" end="00:53:03.089" style="s2">out other competitors from competing</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.450" end="00:53:04.769" style="s2">against me or make my product the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.089" end="00:53:06.779" style="s2">you know give it some special place</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.769" end="00:53:09.029" style="s2">that&#39;s crony capitalism that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.779" end="00:53:11.519" style="s2">capitalism but it&#39;s people using how we</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.029" end="00:53:13.109" style="s2">operate our social networks how we as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.519" end="00:53:15.269" style="s2">human being operate in the human world</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.109" end="00:53:16.799" style="s2">in the meat space to our advantage</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.269" end="00:53:18.390" style="s2">we&#39;re always of course going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.799" end="00:53:21.329" style="s2">but it&#39;s where these systems come undone</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.390" end="00:53:22.589" style="s2">yeah to tie this back into a broadly</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.329" end="00:53:25.640" style="s2">Union perspective</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.589" end="00:53:28.769" style="s2">young of course being concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.640" end="00:53:31.410" style="s2">delving into our past and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.769" end="00:53:35.180" style="s2">development and the evolution of themes</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.410" end="00:53:38.690" style="s2">and patterns of action lenses of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.180" end="00:53:41.640" style="s2">perception that have evolved or have</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.690" end="00:53:44.249" style="s2">co-evolved with human beings and their</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.640" end="00:53:46.619" style="s2">particular methods of adaptation to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.249" end="00:53:50.160" style="s2">world the fact is that there&#39;s an awful</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.619" end="00:53:51.809" style="s2">lot that we come pre-built with in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.160" end="00:53:55.019" style="s2">bodies you know there&#39;s a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.809" end="00:53:57.539" style="s2">potential we have our culture itself to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.019" end="00:53:59.789" style="s2">me it&#39;s intertwined with biology and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.539" end="00:54:01.589" style="s2">always informing each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.789" end="00:54:02.759" style="s2">can&#39;t really pull them entirely apart</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.589" end="00:54:04.950" style="s2">from one another and there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.759" end="00:54:06.989" style="s2">parts of it that need to be updated but</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.950" end="00:54:08.789" style="s2">the fact is that there&#39;s a core to what</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.989" end="00:54:13.259" style="s2">we are that we come into the world with</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.789" end="00:54:15.660" style="s2">that has worked insofar as its sustained</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.259" end="00:54:17.609" style="s2">life for many many many millions of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.660" end="00:54:19.529" style="s2">years and you can track it back I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.609" end="00:54:22.229" style="s2">it&#39;s real it&#39;s relevant to track it back</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.529" end="00:54:25.489" style="s2">far beyond and far before the time we</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.229" end="00:54:28.769" style="s2">are human beings so the idea might be to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.489" end="00:54:30.479" style="s2">recognize that there&#39;s lots of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.769" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">we&#39;re doing in the world that if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.479" end="00:54:33.749" style="s2">suddenly come to realize it while it</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:36.839" style="s2">seems so far and all of a sudden I</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.749" end="00:54:39.210" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize it was so strange that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:42.210" style="s2">was complicit in some sort of weird</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.210" end="00:54:45.660" style="s2">maybe I wasn&#39;t aware of how the element</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.210" end="00:54:47.640" style="s2">of sexuality crept into how I dressed or</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.660" end="00:54:52.259" style="s2">how I treated different sorts of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.640" end="00:54:55.710" style="s2">or how having a sort of imitation like</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.259" end="00:54:57.119" style="s2">respect for an older person made me act</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.710" end="00:54:59.219" style="s2">a different way around them and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.119" end="00:55:00.869" style="s2">I felt intimidated by them in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.219" end="00:55:03.059" style="s2">respect or challenge and that made me</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.869" end="00:55:05.190" style="s2">have frustrated but hey maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.059" end="00:55:08.609" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive value to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.190" end="00:55:11.130" style="s2">recognised in in respecting somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.609" end="00:55:13.499" style="s2">and positive value to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.130" end="00:55:15.670" style="s2">well it&#39;s the flip side of the coin you</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.499" end="00:55:19.430" style="s2">you have a system or a strut</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.670" end="00:55:22.010" style="s2">Society on one hand it can tend towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.430" end="00:55:24.260" style="s2">tyranny on the other hand it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.010" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">protective space that allows the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.260" end="00:55:28.790" style="s2">possibility for individuals to develop</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:31.100" style="s2">now what those particular structures</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.790" end="00:55:33.170" style="s2">might be need to develop mmm but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.100" end="00:55:35.420" style="s2">fact that there still needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.170" end="00:55:37.580" style="s2">structure and that it can always tend</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.420" end="00:55:39.500" style="s2">towards the negative as well as it can</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.580" end="00:55:41.630" style="s2">the positive is sort of like an eternal</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.500" end="00:55:45.110" style="s2">thing to me but the question is what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.630" end="00:55:47.480" style="s2">worth saving so I guess just to tie this</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.110" end="00:55:49.820" style="s2">back into the concerns I have about when</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.480" end="00:55:52.340" style="s2">psychedelics get tacked on to too many</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.820" end="00:55:55.850" style="s2">other places of discussion or movements</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.340" end="00:55:59.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like change is necessary but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.850" end="00:56:01.310" style="s2">probably very rare that any one</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.000" end="00:56:04.190" style="s2">individual knows what the hell to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.310" end="00:56:05.930" style="s2">about a complex issue fully they might</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.190" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">really understand a small part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.930" end="00:56:09.050" style="s2">then it becomes about how do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:10.520" style="s2">appropriately get experts together and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.050" end="00:56:12.050" style="s2">communicate in a way that you know in</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.520" end="00:56:14.690" style="s2">this or that and that and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.050" end="00:56:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just that we need to move slowly</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.690" end="00:56:18.680" style="s2">but we need to move purposefully I will</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.510" end="00:56:21.050" style="s2">totally agree with you that there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.680" end="00:56:23.000" style="s2">certain like the incarceration that</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.050" end="00:56:24.590" style="s2">comes along with prohibition and these</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.000" end="00:56:26.900" style="s2">sorts of things like there are egregious</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.590" end="00:56:28.970" style="s2">wrongs that are still being done to</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.900" end="00:56:30.500" style="s2">people that&#39;s the sort of stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.970" end="00:56:33.020" style="s2">think it just needs to be cut out you</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.500" end="00:56:34.850" style="s2">know and it&#39;s that sort of activism if</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.020" end="00:56:37.070" style="s2">you like that I could get behind but</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.850" end="00:56:39.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a very it&#39;s very low-hanging fruit</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.070" end="00:56:40.940" style="s2">in a sense it&#39;s decriminalization</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.020" end="00:56:42.710" style="s2">essentially of a personal use doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.940" end="00:56:44.930" style="s2">fix any of the market issues which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.710" end="00:56:47.050" style="s2">where the complex questions come come</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.930" end="00:56:49.820" style="s2">into it but you know if you just had</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.050" end="00:56:51.980" style="s2">decriminalization of all drugs really</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.820" end="00:56:53.630" style="s2">but coarse of psychedelics and at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.980" end="00:56:55.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not punishing people for small</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.630" end="00:56:57.020" style="s2">amounts of of these substances and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.700" end="00:56:58.940" style="s2">running them through a system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.020" end="00:57:00.620" style="s2">likely to create far more trauma than</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.940" end="00:57:03.230" style="s2">the drug itself and then it can open up</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.620" end="00:57:05.030" style="s2">this space to at least begin more honest</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.230" end="00:57:06.530" style="s2">discussions with people and give people</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.030" end="00:57:08.960" style="s2">who are just you know because there</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.530" end="00:57:11.390" style="s2">there is that tendency among some people</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.960" end="00:57:13.490" style="s2">to choose to take a drug as an act of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.390" end="00:57:15.080" style="s2">rebellion of sorts but not sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.490" end="00:57:17.090" style="s2">rational rebellion just sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.080" end="00:57:18.770" style="s2">they&#39;re like given the bird to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.090" end="00:57:21.140" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do this because it&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.770" end="00:57:23.000" style="s2">thing and you told me not to you know I</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.140" end="00:57:24.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve had friends like</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.000" end="00:57:26.900" style="s2">that before but I&#39;ve got some friends</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.770" end="00:57:29.450" style="s2">who have absolutely engaged in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.900" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">action it was like a friend of mine in</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.450" end="00:57:33.410" style="s2">in high school voted for one nation for</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:35.089" style="s2">the sole reason that everybody was like</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.410" end="00:57:38.270" style="s2">are one nation of shit don&#39;t vote for</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.089" end="00:57:40.070" style="s2">nations I had no idea about politics</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.270" end="00:57:41.540" style="s2">he was just like that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.070" end="00:57:43.160" style="s2">everyone&#39;s telling me not to do so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.540" end="00:57:44.990" style="s2">gonna do it like well that&#39;s the classic</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.160" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">human thing right yeah another bit of</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.990" end="00:57:49.010" style="s2">low-hanging fruit if we could only</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:51.680" style="s2">achieve this let&#39;s get to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.010" end="00:57:53.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not considered the pinnacle of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.680" end="00:57:56.839" style="s2">rebellious thing to go out and take some</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.750" end="00:57:58.130" style="s2">sort of illicit drug you know because</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.839" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">there you&#39;re not going to have any of</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.130" end="00:58:01.550" style="s2">the appropriate set in setting or almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:03.320" style="s2">certainly when it&#39;s not going to be part</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.550" end="00:58:05.030" style="s2">of a culture that enables a proper</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.320" end="00:58:07.550" style="s2">integration of some of these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.030" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re never going to stamp out of</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.550" end="00:58:10.670" style="s2">human beings especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">adolescent phase to do exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.670" end="00:58:16.339" style="s2">they&#39;re not supposed to do or at least</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:18.290" style="s2">have to deal with that that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.339" end="00:58:20.180" style="s2">the beauty of human beings as well I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.290" end="00:58:22.369" style="s2">mean you want to properly adapt that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.180" end="00:58:24.740" style="s2">within yourself and find the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.369" end="00:58:26.660" style="s2">boundaries to push in your own life and</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.740" end="00:58:28.579" style="s2">propria areas of uncertainty to play</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.660" end="00:58:30.650" style="s2">around with you know not advocating for</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.579" end="00:58:32.240" style="s2">like ridiculous behavior that&#39;s puts</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.650" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">other people or yourself in danger</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.240" end="00:58:40.490" style="s2">throwing as fiery flares into groups of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:42.890" style="s2">a teenager so these questions they all</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.490" end="00:58:44.690" style="s2">seem to come come back to I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.890" end="00:58:46.730" style="s2">I can get too much further than just</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.690" end="00:58:49.099" style="s2">attempting to have honest conversations</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.730" end="00:58:51.200" style="s2">about some of this stuff and then to try</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.099" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">and to try and relate it to some</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.200" end="00:58:55.190" style="s2">metaphysical issues and some scientific</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:57.410" style="s2">issues I find it really difficult though</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.190" end="00:58:59.630" style="s2">because this you know we met for mere</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.410" end="00:59:01.460" style="s2">moments a few months ago but otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.630" end="00:59:03.619" style="s2">we&#39;ve never spoken before and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.460" end="00:59:06.650" style="s2">so challenging to try and take</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.619" end="00:59:09.020" style="s2">everything all the intellectual baggage</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.650" end="00:59:11.329" style="s2">that I come to a conversation with and</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.020" end="00:59:14.390" style="s2">all the terms that I think I&#39;m more or</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.329" end="00:59:16.099" style="s2">less understand and more or less kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.390" end="00:59:17.780" style="s2">cobble together cohesively and then and</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.099" end="00:59:19.700" style="s2">then find the appropriate place to build</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.780" end="00:59:21.829" style="s2">a bridge between when you&#39;re sitting and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.700" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">then go okay what are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.829" end="00:59:26.390" style="s2">are the sort of binding bridge making</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">actually wait patterns of action that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.390" end="00:59:30.770" style="s2">can both get on board with and we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:33.650" style="s2">that level of I think that first</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.770" end="00:59:36.950" style="s2">principles level of just sorting out how</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.650" end="00:59:39.440" style="s2">to have difficult conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.950" end="00:59:42.200" style="s2">strange things in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.440" end="00:59:42.920" style="s2">immediately sequester who you&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="00:59:42.920" end="00:59:47.390" style="s2">into some ideological box that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.770" end="00:59:48.530" style="s2">means they believe all of this and</p>

<p begin="00:59:57.470" end="01:00:00.829" style="s2">have this bridge making potential</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.270" end="01:00:03.410" style="s2">between human beings and I would like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.829" end="01:00:05.000" style="s2">see I could see that being leveraged for</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.410" end="01:00:06.770" style="s2">a very positive purpose you know people</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.000" end="01:00:08.569" style="s2">always talk about the fact that human</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.770" end="01:00:09.589" style="s2">beings are sort of tribal creatures and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.569" end="01:00:11.000" style="s2">we could also come at it from a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.589" end="01:00:13.910" style="s2">psychological perspective but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.000" end="01:00:17.089" style="s2">sort of there&#39;s a unifying element to</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.910" end="01:00:18.980" style="s2">the other you know you can band together</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.089" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">and work cooperatively if you&#39;ve all if</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.980" end="01:00:22.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this enemy now the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:25.220" style="s2">is if we&#39;re gonna take that as a model</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.730" end="01:00:27.500" style="s2">what is the appropriate other to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.220" end="01:00:29.569" style="s2">orient in everybody it was gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.500" end="01:00:31.549" style="s2">aliens isn&#39;t is that still the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.569" end="01:00:34.549" style="s2">prevailing theme or no sorry we need a</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.549" end="01:00:36.920" style="s2">devil or a Hell or yes yeah you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.549" end="01:00:38.390" style="s2">people do like to gather around that and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.920" end="01:00:40.670" style="s2">have that other but I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.390" end="01:00:43.790" style="s2">touch on something quickly you were just</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.670" end="01:00:47.809" style="s2">mentioning and it&#39;s the word psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.790" end="01:00:49.609" style="s2">is a word that was coined by his name</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.809" end="01:00:52.099" style="s2">now is in the conversation with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.609" end="01:00:53.780" style="s2">phrase was to fathom helps or angelic</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.099" end="01:00:55.940" style="s2">just take a pinch of psychedelic and</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.780" end="01:00:57.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not about linguistic standards it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.940" end="01:01:00.200" style="s2">not a properly constructed word it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.200" end="01:01:04.280" style="s2">meant to mean to to manifest mind</p>

<p begin="01:01:04.280" end="01:01:08.329" style="s2">we&#39;ve ended up with this word by sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.319" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">historical anomaly now as a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.329" end="01:01:13.670" style="s2">things aren&#39;t come along and happen but</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:16.190" style="s2">the word psychedelic means to manifest</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.670" end="01:01:18.200" style="s2">what&#39;s in the mind but that&#39;s all we</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.190" end="01:01:20.510" style="s2">ever do all we&#39;re ever doing is</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.200" end="01:01:22.490" style="s2">manifesting and creating in this world</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.510" end="01:01:25.490" style="s2">what was in our mind we can&#39;t build</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.980" end="01:01:31.880" style="s2">of it and started to juggle down some</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.809" end="01:01:33.619" style="s2">ideas so in that way it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.880" end="01:01:35.180" style="s2">funny it&#39;s a funny thing that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.619" end="01:01:38.059" style="s2">ended up calling these substances</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.180" end="01:01:40.280" style="s2">psychedelic when it seems that we are by</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.059" end="01:01:42.619" style="s2">our very nature psychedelic creatures</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.280" end="01:01:44.780" style="s2">and maybe this other in that we do I</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.619" end="01:01:46.250" style="s2">think is part of its necessary part of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.780" end="01:01:48.380" style="s2">the biological process we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.250" end="01:01:50.150" style="s2">limited we&#39;re a limited system in terms</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.380" end="01:01:52.460" style="s2">of what the human being actually is</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.150" end="01:01:54.109" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a body that&#39;s yay big we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.460" end="01:01:55.640" style="s2">got so much energy we&#39;ve got a brain</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.109" end="01:01:56.740" style="s2">that can do this that and the other we</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.640" end="01:01:58.570" style="s2">have certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.740" end="01:02:00.910" style="s2">cities that we reach I can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.570" end="01:02:02.980" style="s2">intimately seven billion people I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.910" end="01:02:05.619" style="s2">know the emotional worlds that they live</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.980" end="01:02:07.420" style="s2">in the history it&#39;s a huge task and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.619" end="01:02:09.580" style="s2">come up with all kinds of psychological</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.420" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">shortcuts to do that and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.580" end="01:02:13.540" style="s2">where we get a lot of these archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:15.190" style="s2">and these symbols and stereotypes and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.540" end="01:02:17.050" style="s2">all these ways that we whittle down the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.190" end="01:02:18.730" style="s2">information into small amounts where we</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.050" end="01:02:20.140" style="s2">can then make assumptions about the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.730" end="01:02:21.640" style="s2">person that we&#39;re talking to as he said</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.140" end="01:02:23.770" style="s2">you know somebody says this idea and go</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.640" end="01:02:25.330" style="s2">well that&#39;s the series of ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.770" end="01:02:26.560" style="s2">they believe and we won&#39;t bother talking</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.330" end="01:02:28.330" style="s2">to them anymore because now they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.560" end="01:02:29.980" style="s2">other that other who fits in that</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.330" end="01:02:31.900" style="s2">category and I don&#39;t know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.980" end="01:02:33.700" style="s2">the crazy people or whatever but that a</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.900" end="01:02:36.340" style="s2">lot of that has to do with just this</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.700" end="01:02:38.140" style="s2">kind of inherent metaphysical hubris of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.340" end="01:02:40.390" style="s2">sorts that we have where we say to</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.140" end="01:02:42.250" style="s2">ourselves that we are this this grand</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.390" end="01:02:43.750" style="s2">thing especially in the Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.250" end="01:02:45.700" style="s2">traditions you know where we&#39;re meant to</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.750" end="01:02:47.350" style="s2">be like the reflection of God on earth</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.700" end="01:02:49.360" style="s2">but this kind of from what I read quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.350" end="01:02:51.250" style="s2">a selfish and vengeful God a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.360" end="01:02:53.290" style="s2">time in an Old Testament at least and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.250" end="01:02:55.330" style="s2">then even in the New Testament the whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.290" end="01:02:57.070" style="s2">thing is a bloody human sacrifice cult</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.330" end="01:02:59.140" style="s2">that the only way that we can have</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.070" end="01:03:01.600" style="s2">redemption in the glorious paradise of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.140" end="01:03:03.160" style="s2">afterlife is by accepting the murder of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.600" end="01:03:05.590" style="s2">a human being for something that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.160" end="01:03:06.790" style="s2">sure how we did why that was a wrong</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.590" end="01:03:08.800" style="s2">thing in the first place yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.790" end="01:03:10.390" style="s2">bizarre that separation but I think that</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.800" end="01:03:12.220" style="s2">sometimes we need to remind ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.390" end="01:03:13.930" style="s2">when we&#39;re making those assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.220" end="01:03:15.250" style="s2">about people and actually maybe that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.930" end="01:03:16.900" style="s2">challenge I can say if you listening</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.250" end="01:03:17.950" style="s2">right now whenever you are talking to</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.900" end="01:03:19.869" style="s2">somebody and you&#39;re starting to make a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.950" end="01:03:21.670" style="s2">lot of assumptions especially on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.869" end="01:03:23.920" style="s2">internet remind yourself that this is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.670" end="01:03:26.020" style="s2">abstract version that you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.920" end="01:03:27.880" style="s2">you&#39;re not talking to that person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.020" end="01:03:30.580" style="s2">talking to what you think that person is</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.880" end="01:03:32.740" style="s2">in your head and in in some ways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.580" end="01:03:34.420" style="s2">how we&#39;re never ever truly connected and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.740" end="01:03:36.340" style="s2">why we&#39;re all truly sort of alone in</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.420" end="01:03:38.350" style="s2">this kind of dark nihilistic place but</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.340" end="01:03:39.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not not trying to say it in in that</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.350" end="01:03:43.150" style="s2">kind of way I&#39;m I&#39;m just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.670" end="01:03:46.600" style="s2">foster a reminder that although we are</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.150" end="01:03:48.520" style="s2">only ever going to be whatever we are in</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.600" end="01:03:49.960" style="s2">in our brains we do have this ability to</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.520" end="01:03:52.030" style="s2">connect but we also have the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.960" end="01:03:54.310" style="s2">remember the limitations of what that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.030" end="01:03:56.410" style="s2">connection are and when we understand</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.310" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">our limitations I think understanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.410" end="01:04:00.369" style="s2">limitations is just as important as</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:02.260" style="s2">trying to break through things because</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.369" end="01:04:03.760" style="s2">without understanding where the barriers</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.260" end="01:04:05.290" style="s2">are you can think you&#39;ve broken through</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:07.720" style="s2">it but you&#39;ll just be tricking yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.290" end="01:04:09.940" style="s2">somehow you know thinking this this kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.720" end="01:04:10.660" style="s2">of thinking that we have in neoliberal</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.940" end="01:04:11.920" style="s2">economic</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.660" end="01:04:14.530" style="s2">thought at the moment at the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.920" end="01:04:16.420" style="s2">our our economy is that we can just grow</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.530" end="01:04:18.070" style="s2">and grow forever and I&#39;ve people had</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.420" end="01:04:19.840" style="s2">more choices we&#39;d have better outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.070" end="01:04:21.940" style="s2">because more choices lead to better</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.840" end="01:04:23.350" style="s2">outcomes is bullshit more choices don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.940" end="01:04:26.020" style="s2">lead to better outcomes because people</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.350" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">get confused because people have too</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.020" end="01:04:30.010" style="s2">much information they don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:31.330" style="s2">do with it and I think that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.010" end="01:04:33.400" style="s2">for a lot of us a lot of the time that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.330" end="01:04:34.810" style="s2">we have too much information we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.400" end="01:04:37.360" style="s2">know what to do with it but people love</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.810" end="01:04:38.680" style="s2">to pretend they do people love to you</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.360" end="01:04:40.870" style="s2">know suggest that they&#39;ve got to worked</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.680" end="01:04:42.190" style="s2">out which I know is kind of a conundrum</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.870" end="01:04:43.630" style="s2">in itself because I&#39;m saying I&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.190" end="01:04:47.350" style="s2">worked out by saying that I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.630" end="01:04:49.060" style="s2">worked out but well I mean part of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.350" end="01:04:51.310" style="s2">process is talking about how you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.060" end="01:04:53.920" style="s2">have it worked out that&#39;s the important</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.310" end="01:04:55.780" style="s2">thing there for me let me see I it seems</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.920" end="01:04:57.460" style="s2">to me like a pretty good place to bring</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.780" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">things to a close don&#39;t know about you</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.460" end="01:05:00.850" style="s2">is there anything you want to say to</p>
