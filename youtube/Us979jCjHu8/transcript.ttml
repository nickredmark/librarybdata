<p begin="00:00:11.520" end="00:00:15.220" style="s2">OK, so</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.220" end="00:00:23.120" style="s2">the last time we were here we got maybe a third of the way through this story</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.120" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">the story of Pinokio and the transformation of a marionette into something hypothetically real</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:35.780" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna backtrack a few slides and it&#39;ll get us into it again</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.780" end="00:00:43.700" style="s2">so you remember that the blue fairy, so I would say that the benevolent element of mother nature</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.700" end="00:00:47.540" style="s2">in the schemata that we are going to use to investigate mythology</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.540" end="00:00:54.500" style="s2">was more or less allowed her entrance because Gepetto was a good guy and he wished for the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.500" end="00:00:59.060" style="s2">and so in some sense... here&#39;s a way of thinking about that... you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.060" end="00:01:05.940" style="s2">genetic / environmental studies on children&#39;s temperament have revealed something quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.940" end="00:01:12.220" style="s2">which is that the shared environment that children have within a family</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.220" end="00:01:16.440" style="s2">so that would be what&#39;s the same about your environment and your brother&#39;s environment, the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.440" end="00:01:20.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that much effect on your temperament or his temperament</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.260" end="00:01:25.100" style="s2">&#39;cause the presumption always was that within a family there is a shared environment, right?</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.100" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">and something was common about the environment to every child within that environment</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:34.100" style="s2">but there isn&#39;t much of a shared environmental effect on temperament</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.100" end="00:01:40.480" style="s2">so then you can say, well that makes it appear as though isn&#39;t that relevant in relationship to the development of temperament</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.480" end="00:01:43.440" style="s2">but you could also suggest something else</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.440" end="00:01:51.640" style="s2">you could suggest that if parenting is occurring properly, the effect of the shared environment should be very close to zero</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.640" end="00:01:58.080" style="s2">and the reason for that is that you establish an individual relationship with each child</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.080" end="00:02:06.520" style="s2">and the environment is actually a microenvironment that&#39;s composed of your observations of this child and that specific child&#39;s interaction with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.520" end="00:02:12.680" style="s2">like to some degree, if there is a shared environment, that means that you&#39;re forcing the same principles on every child</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.680" end="00:02:17.820" style="s2">so my suspicions are, although I don&#39;t know this, and the research hasn&#39;t been done</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.820" end="00:02:23.980" style="s2">that in bad families there&#39;s a shared environmental effect, but in good families that minimizes</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.980" end="00:02:32.300" style="s2">so that lets the child&#39;s biological predisposition, roughly, manifest itself with support and in some positive manner</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.300" end="00:02:38.060" style="s2">well, I don&#39;t want to extend the analogy too far, but you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.060" end="00:02:44.100" style="s2">that, and this is what this film proposes, if you aim properly in relationship to your child</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.100" end="00:02:49.180" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do is to establish an individual relationship and to allow them to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.180" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">whatever their particular expression of individuality happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:58.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s... that would be the same as allowing nature to take its course in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.900" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">at least nature in its positive guise, and that&#39;s exactly what happens here</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:09.780" style="s2">the other thing that happens, of course, is that the cricket, for reasons that aren&#39;t clear, precisely</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.780" end="00:03:15.740" style="s2">is knighted by the blue fairy and serves as Pinokio&#39;s conscience</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.740" end="00:03:22.600" style="s2">although he isn&#39;t very good at it, which is a very peculiar thing, and quite a marked point that the film is making</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.600" end="00:03:25.940" style="s2">that that conscience actually has something to learn, too</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.940" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s actually a Freudian element to that, you know, because Freud thought of the superego</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:34.120" style="s2">as the internalization, roughly speaking, of the father,</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.120" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">and it could be very severe, the superego, so like a really strict father, really tyrannical father inside your head</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:47.720" style="s2">although I think it&#39;s better to think about the superego as the internalized representation of society at large</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:53.540" style="s2">mediated to some degree through your parents, &#39;cause it&#39;s not as if your father, even assuming he&#39;s tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.540" end="00:03:58.580" style="s2">is the inventor of all those tyrannical rules, he&#39;s the  propagator of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.580" end="00:04:05.560" style="s2">but he&#39;s actually a proxy voice, even if it&#39;s just for the harsh side of society, he&#39;s the proxy voice for society</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.560" end="00:04:12.520" style="s2">and because we&#39;re social creatures, the utility of having an internal social voice to guide you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.520" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">although, again, you seem to be able to follow it or not follow it, which I also find spectacularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:22.760" style="s2">because, obviously if it was an unerring guide, you could just follow it</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.760" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">and if it was an unerring guide, you wouldn&#39;t need free will either, because you could just act out the dictates of this internal representation</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:38.460" style="s2">so anyways, the proposition here is that the conscience exists, but it&#39;s a relatively flawed entity</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.460" end="00:04:42.620" style="s2">it needs to be modified as well by nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.620" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">which is quite interesting, &#39;cause the blue fairy knights him, &#39;cause you also might think of the conscience as only something that&#39;s socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">right, which is the more typical viewpoint, but I don&#39;t buy that for a second</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:05:01.300" style="s2">because I believe firmly, and I believe the Piagetian interpretation of child development</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.300" end="00:05:07.800" style="s2">more or less bears this out, is that there are parameters within which conscience has to operate</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.800" end="00:05:14.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s sort of like this, it&#39;s like, it&#39;s the same parameters that govern fair play, we&#39;ll say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.200" end="00:05:20.460" style="s2">and so you can say there&#39;s fair play within a game, and there&#39;s fair play across sets of games</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.460" end="00:05:26.220" style="s2">and the set of games is pretty much indistinguishable from the actual environment</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:34.580" style="s2">if you think all the things you do as nested games, at some point the spread of that is large enough so that it encompasses everything you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.580" end="00:05:42.460" style="s2">which includes the environment, and so I believe that you&#39;re adapted to the set of all possible games, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.460" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">all possible playable games, something like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:51.380" style="s2">and that you know the rules for that, which is why, we talked about this a little bit, why you&#39;re so good at identifying cheaters</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.380" end="00:05:54.760" style="s2">we have a module for that, according to the evolutionary psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.760" end="00:05:59.780" style="s2">and not only you identify them, but you remember them, it really sticks in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.780" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s other evidence, too, one piece of evidence that I love, well, there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:14.980" style="s2">one I would derive from Frans de Waal, who&#39;s a famous primatologis, and he studied the prototype morality that emerges in chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.980" end="00:06:18.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s very much nested in their dominance structures</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.840" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">you know, because you could think of morality in some sense as the understanding of the rules by which the dominance hierarchy operates, right</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:29.800" style="s2">and so you could say, well, the biggest, ugliest, meanest chimp...</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.800" end="00:06:34.940" style="s2">and the male dominance hierarchies in chimps seem to be the predominant ones, although the females also have a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.940" end="00:06:39.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite so clear in bonobos, which seem to be more female-dominated</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.560" end="00:06:44.940" style="s2">but in any case, the primary chimp dominance structure is male</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.940" end="00:06:52.440" style="s2">and you could think, well it&#39;s like the caveman chimp who&#39;s biggest and toughest who necessarily rules, and who rules longest</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.440" end="00:06:58.520" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t what de Waal  found; see, the problem with being... mean, lets say</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.520" end="00:07:04.580" style="s2">and not negotiating your social landscape, and not trading reciprocal favors</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.580" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">is that no matter how powerful you are as an individual, two individuals three quarters your power could do you in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:18.940" style="s2">and that happens with the chimps fairly regularly; if the guy on top is too tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.940" end="00:07:24.040" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t make social connections, then weaker chimps, males, make good social connections</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.040" end="00:07:27.940" style="s2">and when he&#39;s not in such good shape, they take him down, and viciously too</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.940" end="00:07:33.780" style="s2">de Waal has documented some unbelievably horrendous acts of, let&#39;s call it, regicide</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.780" end="00:07:37.860" style="s2">among the chimpanzee troupes that he studied, mostly in the Arnhem zoo</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.860" end="00:07:41.460" style="s2">the big troupe there, that&#39;s been there a long time</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.460" end="00:07:47.000" style="s2">but he&#39;s very interested in prototypical morality, and here&#39;s some other examples of prototypical morality</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.000" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">emerging among animals, there&#39;s many of them, but one is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">you know, if two wolves have a dominance dispute, again that would be more likely among the male wolves</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:08:00.620" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t really matter, they basically display their size, and they growl ferociously</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.620" end="00:08:06.600" style="s2">and they puff up their hair so they look bigger, and you can see cats do that when they go into fight or flight</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.600" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">not only do they puff up, including their tail, but they stand sideways</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">and the reason they do that is because they look bigger</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.320" end="00:08:16.700" style="s2">right, &#39;cause they&#39;re trying to put up the most intimidating possible front</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.700" end="00:08:22.300" style="s2">so anyways, if two wolves are going at it, what they&#39;re really trying to do is to size each other up</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.300" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to scare each other into backing off, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">because, see, the worst-case scenario is like, you&#39;re wolf number one, and I&#39;m wolf number two</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:37.400" style="s2">and we tear each other to shreds, but I win, but I&#39;m so damaged after that wolf number three comes in and takes me out</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.400" end="00:08:43.900" style="s2">so, like, there&#39;s a big cost to be paid even for victory in a dominance dispute, if it degenerates into violence</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.900" end="00:08:50.380" style="s2">and animals, and human beings, but animals in particular, have evolved very, very specific mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.380" end="00:08:56.260" style="s2">to escalate dominance disputes towards violence step by step</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.260" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">so that they don&#39;t... so that the victor doesn&#39;t risk incapacitating himself by winning</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:09.180" style="s2">so what happens with the wolves is that, you know, they growl at each other and posture display, and maybe they even snap at each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.180" end="00:09:13.280" style="s2">but the probability that they&#39;re gonna get into a full-fledged fight is pretty low</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.280" end="00:09:17.500" style="s2">and what happens is, one of the wolves backs off,  and flips over and shows his neck</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.500" end="00:09:22.280" style="s2">and that basically means: &quot;all right, tear it out,&quot; and the other wolf says:</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.280" end="00:09:28.500" style="s2">though of course he doesn&#39;t, &quot;well, you&#39;re kind of an idiot, and you&#39;re not that strong, but we might need you to take down a moose in the future</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.500" end="00:09:32.260" style="s2">and, you know, despite your patheticness, I won&#39;t  tear out your throat&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.260" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">and then they&#39;ve established their dominance position, and then, from then on, at least for some substantial period of time</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:41.380" style="s2">the subordinate wolf gives way to the dominant wolf</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.380" end="00:09:46.140" style="s2">but at least the subordinate wolf is alive, and, you know, he might be dominant over other wolves</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.140" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">and so, everyone in the whole hierarchy has sorted that out either through mock combat or through combat itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:10:01.160" style="s2">and, you know, the low-ranking members aren&#39;t in the best possible position, but at least they&#39;re not getting their heads torn off every second of their existence</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.160" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s even some utility in the stability of the dominance hierarchy for the low-ranking members</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:11.300" style="s2">&#39;cause at least they&#39;re not getting pounded, getting threatened, which is way better</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.300" end="00:10:14.600" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s not good, but it&#39;s way better than actual combat</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.600" end="00:10:18.900" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the example of rats, which I love, this is Jaak Panksepp&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.900" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">and he wrote a book called affective neuroscience, which I highly, highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:26.860" style="s2">I have a list of readings, recommended readings on my website</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.860" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a brilliant book, and he&#39;s a brilliant psychologist, really, one of the top psychologists as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:40.180" style="s2">both theoretically and experimentally, a real genius, he&#39;s the guy who discovered that rats laugh when you tickle them</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.180" end="00:10:45.400" style="s2">they laugh ultrasonically, so you can&#39;t actually hear them, but if you record it and slow it down</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.400" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">then you can hear them giggling away when you tickle them with an erase, which  is sort of like their mother&#39;s tongue</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:55.100" style="s2">it&#39;s often what lab people use as a substitute for the licking of the little rat by the mother</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.100" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">so, and he discovered the paly circuit in mammals, which is like a major deal, right</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:05.780" style="s2">he should get a Nobel prize for that, that&#39;s a big deal to discover an entire motivational circuit</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.780" end="00:11:11.260" style="s2">whose existence no one had really predicted, you know, apart from the fact that obviously mammals play</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.260" end="00:11:15.820" style="s2">and even lizards maybe, some of them are social lizards, seem to play</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.820" end="00:11:21.800" style="s2">so, anyhow, what Panksepp observed, and I think this is a brilliant piece of science</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.800" end="00:11:28.200" style="s2">is that, first of all, juvenile male rats in particular like to rough and tubmle play</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.200" end="00:11:33.420" style="s2">like to wrestle, and they actually pin each other like little kids do, or like adult wrestlers do</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.420" end="00:11:38.440" style="s2">they pin their shoulders down, and that basically means you win, and so, OK, so that&#39;s pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.440" end="00:11:42.180" style="s2">but what&#39;s even cooler, I think, well there&#39;s three things, one is:</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.180" end="00:11:47.340" style="s2">the rats will work for an opportunity to get into an arena where they know that play might occur</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.340" end="00:11:51.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one of the scientific ways of testing an animal&#39;s motivation, right</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.960" end="00:11:57.580" style="s2">so imagine you have a starving rat and it knows that it&#39;s got food down in the end of a corridoor</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.580" end="00:12:03.740" style="s2">you can put a little spring on its tail and measure how hard it pulls, and that gives you and idication of its motivational force</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.740" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2">now, imagine the starving rat that&#39;s trying to get to some food, and you have a little spring on its tail, and you waft in some cat odor</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.000" end="00:12:17.280" style="s2">so now that rat is starving and wants to get out of there, he&#39;s going to pull even farther towards the food</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.280" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">so getting away plus getting forward are separate motivational systems, and if you can add them together it&#39;s real potent</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:29.460" style="s2">and part of the reason why in the future authoring exercise that you guys are gonna do as the class progresses</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.460" end="00:12:33.340" style="s2">you&#39;re asked to outline the place you&#39;d like to end up, which is your desired future</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.340" end="00:12:37.960" style="s2">and also the place that you could end up if you let everything fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.960" end="00:12:43.460" style="s2">so that your anxiety chases you and your approach systems pull you forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.460" end="00:12:51.020" style="s2">you&#39;re maximally motivated then, and it&#39;s important, because otherwise you can be afraid of pursuing the things you wanna pursue</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.020" end="00:12:56.520" style="s2">right, and that&#39;s very common, and so then the fear inhibits you as the promise pulls you forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.520" end="00:13:01.420" style="s2">but it makes you weak, because you&#39;re afraid; you wanna get your fear behind you, pushing you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.420" end="00:13:07.320" style="s2">and so what you wanna be is more afraid of not pursuing your goals than you are of pursuing them</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.320" end="00:13:12.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very, very helpful; and lots of times in life, and this is something really worth knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.760" end="00:13:16.940" style="s2">you know, and this is one of the advantages to being an autonomous adult</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.940" end="00:13:20.500" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to pick the best thing, you get to pick your poison</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.500" end="00:13:24.760" style="s2">you have two bad choices, and you get to pick which one you&#39;re willing to suffer through</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.760" end="00:13:30.100" style="s2">and every choice has a bit of that element in it, and so, if you know that it&#39;s really freeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.100" end="00:13:36.700" style="s2">because otherwise you torture yourself by thinking: &quot;well, maybe there&#39;s a good solution to this, compared to the bad solution&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.700" end="00:13:41.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like, no, no, sometime&#39;s there&#39;s just risky solution 1, and risky solution 2</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.820" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">and sometimes both of them are really bad, but you at least get to pick which one you&#39;re willing to suffer through</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:53.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s... that actually makes quite a bit of difference, because you&#39;re also facing it voluntarily then</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.380" end="00:13:59.200" style="s2">instead of it chasing you, and that is an entirely different psychophysiological response</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.200" end="00:14:05.240" style="s2">challenge vs threat, it&#39;s not the same, even if the magnitude of the problem is the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:10.260" style="s2">and so putting yourself in a challenging, let&#39;s call it, mindframe, you can&#39;t just do that by magic</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.260" end="00:14:15.700" style="s2">putting yourself in a challenging mindframe is much easier on you psychophysiologically</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.700" end="00:14:20.360" style="s2">&#39;cause you don&#39;t produce... you don&#39;t go into the generalized stress response to the same degree</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.360" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">and you&#39;re activating your exploratory and seeking systems, which are dopaminergically mediated, and that involve positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:34.060" style="s2">so if you can face something voluntarily, rather than having it chase you, it&#39;s way better for you psychophysiologically</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.060" end="00:14:42.040" style="s2">so, that&#39;s partly why, well, it&#39;s worthwhile to go find the dragon in its lair instead of waiting for it to come and eat you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.040" end="00:14:47.020" style="s2">so, and especially if you also add the idea that if you go find the dragon in its lair</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.020" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">you might find it when it&#39;s a baby, instead of a full-fledged bloody monster that is definitely gonna take you down</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:15:00.520" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of the reason why... well there&#39;s a whole bunch of things that emerge out of that observation</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.520" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">like: don&#39;t avoid small problems that you know are there</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:09.100" style="s2">face them, because they&#39;ll grow into big problems all by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.100" end="00:15:15.260" style="s2">and you can think about... imagine the tax department sends you a notification, you owe them, like, 300 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.260" end="00:15:19.940" style="s2">well it&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s annoying, maybe you don&#39;t even wanna open the letter</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.940" end="00:15:25.480" style="s2">or maybe if you do, you just put it on the shelf, but that damn thing doesn&#39;t just sit there like a piece of paper on the shelf</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:31.100" style="s2">right, you ignore that for 5 or 6 years, it&#39;s gonna become attached to all sorts of horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.100" end="00:15:39.300" style="s2">and if you ignore it long enough... you get the idea, it&#39;s gonna turn into something that&#39;s completely unlike the little piece of paper that it&#39;s written on</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.300" end="00:15:47.100" style="s2">and many, many problems in life are like that, you&#39;ll see that they pop their ugly little head up, and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.100" end="00:15:51.480" style="s2">and you might wanna turn away, you might not want to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.480" end="00:15:55.160" style="s2">which is the easiest way of turning away, right, you just don&#39;t attend to it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.160" end="00:15:59.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you repress it or anything like that, you just fail to attend to it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.160" end="00:16:03.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s a... really, as a long-term strategy it&#39;s dismal</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.820" end="00:16:09.140" style="s2">it&#39;s also something, I think, that&#39;s more characteristic of people who are high in neuroticism and high in agreeableness</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.140" end="00:16:11.260" style="s2">&#39;cause agreeable people don&#39;t like conflict</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.260" end="00:16:18.220" style="s2">and people who are high in neuroticism, or high in negative emotion, are hit harder per unit of uncertainty or threat</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.220" end="00:16:24.760" style="s2">and so, you know, and that&#39;s partly why in psychotherapy a lot of times the people you see need assertiveness training</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.760" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">so that would be the opposite of agreeableness, or they need help to get their anxiety and emotional pain under control</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:35.860" style="s2">those are not the only reasons, there&#39;s antisocial behavior, but you can&#39;t fix that in therapy in all likelyhood</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.860" end="00:16:39.820" style="s2">there&#39;s alcoholism, there&#39;s lotsa, lotsa other reasons, but those are two major reasons</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.820" end="00:16:46.340" style="s2">so anyways, there is a... that was all to telly you that... oh yes, back to the rats</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.340" end="00:16:52.520" style="s2">so okay, the rats are pulling on... you can measure rat motivation by how hard they pull on the spring, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.520" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">and they&#39;re more motivated if they&#39;re running away and they&#39;re running towards, but let&#39;s go back to play</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:02.300" style="s2">so, you can take juvenile rats who haven&#39;t been able to play for a while, maybe they&#39;ve been isolated</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.300" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">or maybe they just haven&#39;t been able to engage in physical activity, like many schoolchildren that you might be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:15.240" style="s2">neither allowed to play nor engage in physical activity, and there&#39;s a reason I&#39;m telling you that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.240" end="00:17:20.820" style="s2">so anyways, you get one of these little rats, and you can measure how hard he&#39;ll pull to go out and play</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.820" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">or how many buttons he&#39;ll push, you know, and that gives you an indication of his motivation</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:32.660" style="s2">so anyways, you can see that the play-deprived juvenile rat will fight harder to play than a non-play deprived juvenile rat</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.660" end="00:17:37.140" style="s2">and so you can infer that the rat wants to go play</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.140" end="00:17:41.900" style="s2">and, you know, you do that... you do the same measurement with everyone around you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.900" end="00:17:47.800" style="s2">if they wanna do something, you&#39;re gonna poke and prod at them to see what sort of things they&#39;re willing to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.800" end="00:17:51.480" style="s2">in order to go and do that, you&#39;ll object even if you don&#39;t really object</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.480" end="00:17:56.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like... it&#39;s a measurement device, and if they&#39;re willing to overcome a bunch of your objections</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.580" end="00:17:58.920" style="s2">then you think: &quot;oh, well, maybe they really want to&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.920" end="00:18:06.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s another thing to really know: if there&#39;s something you want, you need about five arguments about why you want it</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.660" end="00:18:13.680" style="s2">because the probability that the person who&#39;s opposing you will have five arguments about why you should&#39;t have it is very low</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.680" end="00:18:18.260" style="s2">they just won&#39;t have thought it through enough; so the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercise</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.260" end="00:18:24.620" style="s2">is that you&#39;re asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out of your vision of the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.620" end="00:18:30.500" style="s2">so you&#39;re asked like: &quot;why would it be good for you? why would it be good for your family? why would it be good for broader society?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.500" end="00:18:33.660" style="s2">so that gives you three levels of argumentation right there</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.660" end="00:18:38.280" style="s2">and if you have it articulated down into detail, and it&#39;s related to other important goals</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.280" end="00:18:43.500" style="s2">they you&#39;re a hell of a thing to argue with, because people just aren&#39;t that deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.500" end="00:18:48.860" style="s2">by which I mean that they just don&#39;t have that many levels of explanation or objection</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.860" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s also really useful in relationship to your own mind, because if you want to do something that&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:59.080" style="s2">and that requires energy, a lot of different subsystems  in your mind are gonna throw up objections</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.080" end="00:19:03.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like, &quot;well, maybe that isn&#39;t what you should be doing right now, maybe you should be doing the dishes</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.060" end="00:19:05.960" style="s2">or vacuuming, or watching TV, or looking at YouTube&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.960" end="00:19:11.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re really sneaky, when you&#39;re trying to do something hard, what your brain does</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.000" end="00:19:16.580" style="s2">is give you something else hard to do that &#39;s not quite as hard, so that you can feel justified in not doing the thing you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.580" end="00:19:21.380" style="s2">&#39;cause you&#39;re doing somethig else useful, and if you give in to that temptation, which you often will</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.380" end="00:19:26.280" style="s2">then it wins, and because it wins, it gets a little dopamine kick, and it grows stronger</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.280" end="00:19:30.920" style="s2">anything you let win the internal argument, grows</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.920" end="00:19:33.960" style="s2">and anything you let be defeated, shrinks</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.960" end="00:19:37.180" style="s2">&#39;cause it&#39;s punished, it doesn&#39;t get to have its way</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.180" end="00:19:42.700" style="s2">so that&#39;s another thing really to remember, don&#39;t practice what you do not wanna become</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.700" end="00:19:49.040" style="s2">and because those are... they&#39;re neurological circuits, you build those thing in there man, and they&#39;re not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.040" end="00:19:53.020" style="s2">you can build another little machine to inhibit them, that&#39;s the best you can do</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.020" end="00:19:59.700" style="s2">once they&#39;re in there, you can&#39;t get them out, so... and then the one&#39;s you built to inhibit can be taken out by stress</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.700" end="00:20:04.760" style="s2">and the old habits will come back up, so you gotta be careful what you say and what you do</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.760" end="00:20:09.400" style="s2">because you build yourself that way; so anyways, back to the rats</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.400" end="00:20:14.220" style="s2">okay, so the little rat gets to go out there and play, now imagine one little rat is paired with another rat</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.220" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">but the other little rat is 10% bigger, 10% in juvenile rats is enough to attain permanent dominance</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:28.380" style="s2">so the 10% bigger rat will win the first wrestling, and so that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.380" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">and then... so the little rat gets pinned, and maybe they play a bit, and then they&#39;re done with it</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:37.260" style="s2">and so you separate them, then you let them play again, and the next time what happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.260" end="00:20:40.940" style="s2">is that the subordinate rat does the invitation to play</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.940" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s like, you know, like a dog does when he wants to play</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.700" style="s2">you can recognize that, it kind of splays its feet apart, and looks up and looks interested</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.700" end="00:20:53.040" style="s2">and then it sort of dances around; you can do it with any kid that has a clue, you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.040" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been destroyed by adults, if your little 3-year-old, or 4-year-olds are better for this</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.900" style="s2">if you go like this, like, they know exactly what&#39;s gonna happen, you know, they&#39;re ready to dart back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.900" end="00:21:10.360" style="s2">and they&#39;ll usually smile, and kids love rough and tumble play, which is now basically illegal in all daycare</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.360" end="00:21:16.500" style="s2">seriously, it&#39;s seriously is, kids need it so desperately, &#39;cause it teaches them the limits of their body</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.500" end="00:21:20.460" style="s2">and your body, and it teaches them what&#39;s painful and what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.460" end="00:21:26.160" style="s2">and it teaches them the dance of play, and without that they&#39;re just little disembodied blobs</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.160" end="00:21:30.460" style="s2">like, they have no finesse, that&#39;s what you&#39;re checking out when you dance with someone, you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.460" end="00:21:36.660" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing if they have that fluency and facility for mutual reciprocal action</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.660" end="00:21:43.560" style="s2">embodied in them; and if they&#39;re kinda like this, you know, and don&#39;t have any sense of rhythm and don&#39;t pay any attention to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.560" end="00:21:48.520" style="s2">and all of that, you have reason to question whether they actually inhabit their body</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.520" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">and whether they can engage in a mutual interaction, physical interaction that&#39;s going to be reciprocal and mutually satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:02.940" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to check out; and a lot of that rough and tubmle play, even interactions between a child and its mother</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.940" end="00:22:10.460" style="s2">if you have a happy mother and a happy infant, and you videotape them, and you speed up the video tape, you&#39;ll see that they&#39;re dancing</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.460" end="00:22:16.700" style="s2">so one responds, then the other responds, then the other responds, it might be just with eye gaze, and movement, and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.700" end="00:22:21.680" style="s2">but there&#39;s a dynamic interplay, which you don&#39;t see with depressed mothers and their infants</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.680" end="00:22:28.780" style="s2">so, okay, so back to play, so the little rat, who is the subordinate one, he has to do the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.780" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">and then the big rat can agree to play, &#39;cause he&#39;s in the dominant position</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">but if you pair them repeatedly, and this is really worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:42.440" style="s2">because, you see, morality emerges out of repeated interactions</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.440" end="00:22:48.280" style="s2">because, you might say, if you only interact with someone once, you might as well just take advantage of them and run off</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.280" end="00:22:55.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what a psychopath does, by the way, and there is room in the environmental niche for psychopaths</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.400" end="00:22:58.940" style="s2">but they have to keep moving around, &#39;cause otherwise people figure out who they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.940" end="00:23:04.600" style="s2">so they just move around, and they can take advantage of one person, you know, maybe five times, or ten times, or something</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.600" end="00:23:08.160" style="s2">and then the reputation spreads, and they gotta get the hell out of there</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.160" end="00:23:12.620" style="s2">but... so it&#39;s not a good long-term strategy, unless you can&#39;t think of a better one</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.620" end="00:23:20.460" style="s2">so anyways, if you repeatedly pair these rats, unless the big rat lets the little rat win at least 30% of the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.460" end="00:23:23.460" style="s2">the little rat will not ask the big rat to play</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.460" end="00:23:28.520" style="s2">and that is... it&#39;s a staggering discovery, it&#39;s a staggering discovery</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.520" end="00:23:33.220" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got the emergence there of an implicit morality, essentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.220" end="00:23:37.380" style="s2">that&#39;s even incarnated in rats, that emerges across multiple play sessions</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.380" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like, yes, exaclty, that&#39;s exactly what Piaget said about the emergence of morality</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:47.020" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly the same idea, at the rat level, so it&#39;s a massively...</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.020" end="00:23:51.040" style="s2">and the fact that there&#39;s a circuit, a separate neurophysiological circuit</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.040" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">that&#39;s actually specialized for that sort of thing is also a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:24:02.620" style="s2">now the other thing  Panksepp figured out is that if you deprive juvenile rats of the opportunity to engage in rough and tumble play</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.620" end="00:24:05.240" style="s2">their prefrontal cortexes don&#39;t develop properly</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.240" end="00:24:11.340" style="s2">and they become impulsive and restless, and then you can fix them with methylphenidate or ritalin</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.340" end="00:24:17.880" style="s2">and those are the drugs that are used to fix hyperactive kids, most of who are male</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.880" end="00:24:22.940" style="s2">and that&#39;s because, well, really, you&#39;re gonna take your six-year-old, your five-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.940" end="00:24:28.820" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna put them in a desk, you&#39;re gonna get them to sit there for six hours, that&#39;s your plan, right?</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.820" end="00:24:34.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a stupid plan; and they&#39;re denied the opportunity to engage in play</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.460" end="00:24:39.640" style="s2">and that means that their ability to become social is being impaired</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.640" end="00:24:43.380" style="s2">it may cause neurological impairment, that&#39;s what the rat evidence suggests</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.380" end="00:24:49.480" style="s2">and then you suppress that with amphetamines, &#39;cause amphetamines actually activate the play circuit</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.480" end="00:24:53.320" style="s2">they activate a different circuit, which will suppress the play circuit</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.320" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s very, very... it&#39;s not very wise, and I&#39;m not gonna go off on that tangent</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">because I could tell you why the school systems were set up that way, which I probably will at some point</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s quite and interesting story in and of itself, and it&#39;s the reason all you guys are sitting in desks right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:17.860" style="s2">somebody laughingly referred to this once as grade 15, that was pretty funny, given the look of the bloody place, you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.860" end="00:25:22.020" style="s2">hideous... okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.020" end="00:25:27.900" style="s2">so, now, this is an interesting thig, so you got the emergence of morality in, say chimps</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.900" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">you got the emergence of morality in wolves, you got the emergence of morality in rats</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">and the morality governs sequential interactions or group interactions, they have to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:43.180" style="s2">because, because it&#39;s an emerging property of social or repetitive interactions</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.180" end="00:25:47.260" style="s2">that&#39;s why, you can&#39;t just localize it in one instance, it&#39;s repeated</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.260" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s been computer simulations of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:54.660" style="s2">they help you figure out how you might attain victory across games, across time</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.660" end="00:26:01.480" style="s2">maybe you need a strategy, and there&#39;s a very simple strategy, which, I believe is called &quot;modified tit for tat&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.480" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">so if you&#39;re nice to me, I&#39;m nice back, and if you do something bad to me, I do something bad back</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:13.180" style="s2">but imagine you run that out in sequences of behavior, and see who does with what strategy across time</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.180" end="00:26:19.660" style="s2">or an alternative strategy... [?] here&#39;s the best strategy: I trust you, you trust me, we start interacting</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.660" end="00:26:23.620" style="s2">you screw up, I whack you, and then I forgive you, and we start again</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.620" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">that&#39;s modified tit for tat, and so...</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:36.060" style="s2">it&#39;s a very simple algorithm; no one has come up with a better algorithm in a computerized simulation of game space than that particular strategy</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.060" end="00:26:41.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s like: trust but don&#39;t be a pushover, if someone violates the rules, you gotta nail them</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.960" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">but then you don&#39;t hold a grudge, you open the door to further interactions</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">so, pretty smart, pretty smart</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">and, okay, so anyways... so what this means, &#39;cause rats can&#39;t talk, and wolves can&#39;t talk, and chimpanzees can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:01.960" style="s2">and what that means, just as Piaget suggested, was that the morality, the development of the morality</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.960" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">precedes the development of the linguistic ability to describe the rules for the morality</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:13.920" style="s2">he said exactly the same thing about kids, right, is that they learn to play games before they know what the rules are to the games</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.920" end="00:27:18.760" style="s2">and so, you see that when you&#39;re playing peek-a-boo with a kid, they can pick that up really young</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.760" end="00:27:25.320" style="s2">they get that right away, and there&#39;s... you can play with kids almost immediately after they&#39;re born, if you play simple enough games</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.320" end="00:27:28.500" style="s2">so they&#39;ve got that deep, and they&#39;re unbelievably playful</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.500" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">so, they&#39;ve got that circuitry ready to go right off the bat, and it&#39;s one of the things that makes kids so much fun</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:42.440" style="s2">because they just like to play all the time, and so if you... if the play circuit in you hasn&#39;t died</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.440" end="00:27:48.120" style="s2">which is a bad thing, then you can use that a lot with your kids, and it&#39;s one of the things that helps you love them</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.120" end="00:27:51.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s a good thing, so, okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.400" end="00:27:58.280" style="s2">so, the point is that the damn morality emerges before the representation of the morality</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.280" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a big deal to know that, and that it emerges as a consequence of repeated social interaction</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a top-down thing, it&#39;s a bottom-up thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.560" end="00:28:13.860" style="s2">now, Piaget says: well, it&#39;s not just bottom-up, because what happens with human beings is that they learn to play the games...</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.860" end="00:28:20.620" style="s2">one of his experiments was: watch seven-year-olds, I think that&#39;s the right age, play marbles</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.620" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">and then he noticed that they can play with each other, and that they can follow the rules</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">but that if you take the individual seven-year-old out of the game, and you say: what are the rules?</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:33.360" style="s2">they give incoherent and incomplete explanations of the rules</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.360" end="00:28:38.120" style="s2">so what that means is they don&#39;t really represent the rules, but they can act them out</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.120" end="00:28:41.880" style="s2">and have a partial representation of what they&#39;re acting out</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.880" end="00:28:47.620" style="s2">now, when they get older, the rule representation starts to fall into alignment with the actual rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.620" end="00:28:53.800" style="s2">and you can imagine that&#39;s why [?], because when they&#39;re playing something like marbles, they&#39;re gonna have discussions like: you&#39;re cheating</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.800" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">or: you&#39;re not allowed to do that, &#39;cause they&#39;re always gonna be pushing the envelope a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:01.920" style="s2">and then the group is gonna render a judgment on whether or not that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.920" end="00:29:07.540" style="s2">and out of that the rules are going emerge, but they&#39;re not rules to begin with, they&#39;re patterns of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.540" end="00:29:12.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same thing as a rule, a rule describes a pattern of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.200" end="00:29:16.380" style="s2">but a pattern of behavior is a pattern of behavior, it&#39;s something that&#39;s acted out</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.380" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">so, there&#39;s the individual within the group and then the interactions of the individuals within the group produce a hierarchical arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:29.520" style="s2">or multiple hierarchical arrangements, those are games, roughly speaking, or stories</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:33.560" style="s2">nested iside an overarching story, which is the fundamental culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.560" end="00:29:38.540" style="s2">right, and that&#39;s nested within a whole bunch of competing cultures that have some commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.540" end="00:29:44.360" style="s2">or they would just be at war all the time, which, you know, to some degree they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:51.300" style="s2">so, okay, now, you see that... back to the movie, you see that happening in the movie</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.300" end="00:29:57.660" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s very, very quick, but the blue fairy turns the bug into the conscience</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.660" end="00:30:02.600" style="s2">and then the bug tries to explain to Pinokio what the rules of morality are</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.600" end="00:30:07.740" style="s2">but the thing is the bug doesn&#39;t know, because he&#39;s just a bug, and you know, he&#39;s just not omniscient, so</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.740" end="00:30:15.660" style="s2">the best he can do is to come up with, like, a propagandistic semantic, verbal representation</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.660" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">that&#39;s internally contradictory, and when he tells Pinokio, Pinokio has no idea what he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:24.600" style="s2">and neither does the bug, that&#39;s the thing; and so...</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.600" end="00:30:29.960" style="s2">so what happens is this, the cricket says: well Pinok, maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.960" end="00:30:36.440" style="s2">and the puppet says: why? <br />and the cricket says: well, you wanna be a real boy, don&#39;t you?</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.440" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">alright, sit down son, now you see the world as full of temptations</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:47.280" style="s2">- temptations?<br />- yes, temptations, they&#39;re the wrong things that seem right at the time</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.280" end="00:30:55.540" style="s2">but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things may be right at the wrong time</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.540" end="00:31:00.820" style="s2">or vice versa, understand?<br />- no!</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.820" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">no, and neither did the cricket, and that&#39;s actually very nicely done in that piece of the movie</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:11.060" style="s2">because you just wanna slap him as soon as he starts talking like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.060" end="00:31:17.300" style="s2">because he gets up on his little matchbox and lectures, and he&#39;s dull and tyrannical, both at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.300" end="00:31:22.980" style="s2">and so there&#39;s nothing genuine about what he&#39;s saying, he&#39;s imitating something that isn&#39;t him</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.980" end="00:31:27.260" style="s2">so he&#39;s really acting like a puppet at that point, too, and it doesn&#39;t work at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.260" end="00:31:33.820" style="s2">and so Pinokio says: I&#39;m going to try to be a good boy; and the cricket says: well that&#39;s the spirit, son</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.820" end="00:31:36.680" style="s2">and then away they go, so...</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.680" end="00:31:41.180" style="s2">alright, so then we&#39;re at the next day, &#39;cause this all happens in one night</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.180" end="00:31:44.760" style="s2">we&#39;re at the next day, and you know, it&#39;s a nice day, and there&#39;s these birds flying around</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.760" end="00:31:48.140" style="s2">that&#39;s actually, that&#39;s a bit of foreshadowing there, you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.140" end="00:31:53.980" style="s2">so, um, you have to remember, when you watch something like this movie</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.980" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">not a single bit of it is random or accidental, none of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:04.520" style="s2">because, you know, they had to draw I don&#39;t remember how many frames per second these things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.520" end="00:32:10.640" style="s2">thirty, maybe, if it&#39;s high-quality animation; so someone had to paint thirty pictures to get a second of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.640" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing that accidentally, it&#39;s really expensive, and everyone has to agree on exactly what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:21.000" style="s2">and you might say: well, do the people who are doing this consciously know what they&#39;re doing?</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.000" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">and the answer to that is: well, sort of, just like you do, it&#39;s yes, they know, and no, they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:33.020" style="s2">and they know because they&#39;re really smart and gifted, and all that, but they don&#39;t know, because it&#39;s not all articulated</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.020" end="00:32:38.800" style="s2">plus they&#39;re working in a group, so they know and don&#39;t know, just like you do when you&#39;re watching it</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.800" end="00:32:41.640" style="s2">and so... and when you do anything else...</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.640" end="00:32:46.840" style="s2">now, they&#39;re also guided by what you might call... they&#39;re guided by their unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.840" end="00:32:50.300" style="s2">in the Freudian, and in the cognitive way, partly because</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.300" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">your unconscious value structures determine the direction and content of your perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:33:00.660" style="s2">so it&#39;s built right into the way you move your eyes, &#39;cause you tend to look at things you value</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.660" end="00:33:05.060" style="s2">right, or at things you&#39;re afraid of, like you look at things with valence</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.060" end="00:33:11.000" style="s2">and part of the decision about what has value is dependent on the implicit structure of your moral system</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.000" end="00:33:13.940" style="s2">because morality is about what&#39;s good, and what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.940" end="00:33:18.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s been partly a conscious construction of you, but it&#39;s partly partly something you&#39;ve been...</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.620" end="00:33:21.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve picked up by interacting with people like mad since you were born</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.980" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t know all the rules anymore than the damn cricked did</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:31.500" style="s2">you just don&#39;t, and you can&#39;t, &#39;cause you&#39;re too complicated, but you act them out</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.500" end="00:33:36.660" style="s2">and then you also have representations of how people act, in your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.660" end="00:33:43.620" style="s2">that&#39;s what a dream is, that&#39;s what a fantasy is, that&#39;s what that little movie that plays inside your head when you remember what you did is</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.620" end="00:33:52.680" style="s2">and you only remember the gist, you know, so even the imagistic representation of your behavior in your past, which is basically your episodic memory</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.680" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s already selecting, and molding, and turning it into a relatable story</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:01.800" style="s2">it can&#39;t help but do that, it&#39;s the only way you can represent it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.800" end="00:34:07.160" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t know how you do that or why you do that, but part of it&#39;s governed by this implicit morality</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.160" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s part of your procedural memory, part of the way you act, part of the way you move your eyes, and listen to things, and focus on them</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:20.860" style="s2">that&#39;s all been instantiated inside of you because of your biology, but also this immense social project</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.860" end="00:34:23.020" style="s2">that you&#39;re continually engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.020" end="00:34:29.800" style="s2">and so, that informs what you remember, it informs what you imagine, it informs what we collectively imagine</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.800" end="00:34:32.640" style="s2">it informs what we can collectively understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.640" end="00:34:41.980" style="s2">and partly what you&#39;re doing while you become conscious of yourself is to map the implicit structures that already constitute you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.980" end="00:34:45.680" style="s2">from society into explicit representation</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.680" end="00:34:51.180" style="s2">that&#39;s what self-understanding means; and you know, when you have that moment of insight about something you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.180" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re watching this repetitive behavior that you&#39;ve manifested, probably that got you in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:35:00.580" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s your characteristic way of falling accidentally into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.580" end="00:35:05.240" style="s2">and you talk about it, your problems, you talk about them with your friends, you talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.240" end="00:35:08.060" style="s2">and maybe you have dreams about them, and you&#39;re trying to relate them</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.060" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">and you have memories about them that you can&#39;t get rid of, &#39;cause they&#39;re negatively toned</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:16.460" style="s2">so you talk about them, and then someone comes up with a little statement that links them together causally</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.460" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">and you thing: aha! that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing; and then maybe you can stop doing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:26.900" style="s2">or at least maybe then you can thing of some strategies for not doing it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.900" end="00:35:32.060" style="s2">but it&#39;s not like you know, it&#39;s like you&#39;re acting it out, you know it that way</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.060" end="00:35:39.380" style="s2">but until the representation matches that pattern, that click of insight doesn&#39;t occur</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.380" end="00:35:43.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s like a revelation, it&#39;s a really good way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.000" end="00:35:48.940" style="s2">because the knowledge is there in its implicit form, and all of a sudden, bang! it&#39;s been made explicit</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.940" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">as a fantasy maybe, or also as a set of semantic statements</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:35:57.320" style="s2">you know, maybe you have a crush on someone and you don&#39;t notice it</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.320" end="00:36:03.820" style="s2">and maybe you find yourself having a fantasy about them, you think: oh! that means something!</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.820" end="00:36:08.780" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t want to know that that&#39;s what you want, but the fantasy will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.780" end="00:36:15.660" style="s2">and one of the things Jung suggested, and this is sort of out of the freudian tradition of free association</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.660" end="00:36:22.300" style="s2">is: watch yourself, watch your fantasies, because they&#39;re always happening, and they&#39;ll tell you something</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.300" end="00:36:29.560" style="s2">and so, one of the things I do when I&#39;m interacting with my clients is we&#39;ll have a discussion, and then their eyes will drift a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.560" end="00:36:33.600" style="s2">and I&#39;ll know that something&#39;s flitted through their mind, you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.600" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">and that means we&#39;ve touched on something that has a multiplicity of elements</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:43.600" style="s2">and so I&#39;ll stop and say: look, I noticed that you... maybe you teared up, that&#39;s another thing  to really watch</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.600" end="00:36:49.800" style="s2">or maybe you laughed, or you drifted at least, it&#39;s like... it&#39;s because some other thought has entered your field of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.800" end="00:36:53.840" style="s2">and if you can get the person to grab those thoughts, to notice them</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.840" end="00:36:59.860" style="s2">then you can often figure out the avenues along which that particular conversation might unfold</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.860" end="00:37:03.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a complex, that&#39;s a Jungian complex or a psychoanalytic complex</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.420" end="00:37:08.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like, there&#39;s an emotional core that produces a whole range of associated ideas</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.500" end="00:37:14.220" style="s2">and that thing&#39;s got a life, it&#39;s like a micropersonality, and it might have resentment in it, might have anger</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.220" end="00:37:22.120" style="s2">it&#39;s often negative emotion-tinged, because negative emotion-tinged episodes are still problems</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.120" end="00:37:28.620" style="s2">and they will emerge automatically, &#39;cause you&#39;re threat detection systems force them onto your consciousness, essentially</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.620" end="00:37:36.260" style="s2">so you watch, and when you drift... you&#39;ll drift, and the fantasy is partly a representation of of the problem space</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.260" end="00:37:39.780" style="s2">you know, that happens when you wake up at three in the morning and you&#39;re worried about things</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.780" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">right, &#39;cause actually what happens is you wake up during threat processing</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:49.560" style="s2">and if you&#39;re depressed, actually that gets so intense, you can&#39;t sleep, so then you just lay there all night, worrying</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.560" end="00:37:55.120" style="s2">not fun, and those are fantasies about the negative elements of your past, present and future</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.120" end="00:38:02.760" style="s2">and the fantasies can also breed solutions, and that&#39;s partly why Freud regarded dreams as wish-fulfillments</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.760" end="00:38:09.080" style="s2">it&#39;s partly... and he wasn&#39;t... that was where he stopped; it&#39;s not correct</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.080" end="00:38:15.940" style="s2">it&#39;s partially correct, it&#39;s like the fantasy will provide you with a problem and a potential solution</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.940" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">but they&#39;re more like problem-identification mechanisms, the fantasies, with the possibility of a solution built in</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">and so, a way of thinking about that is that you can generate potential futures</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:36.260" style="s2">so they&#39;re like each segregateable environments, according to the rules of your fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.260" end="00:38:41.980" style="s2">then you can generate little avatars of yourself that inhabit each of those little universes, and you can run them as simulations</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.980" end="00:38:47.900" style="s2">and then you can watch what happens in the simulation, and if it&#39;s a catastrophy, then you don&#39;t have to act it out</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.900" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly, not exactly, that&#39;s akin to what you&#39;re doing when you go watch a movie</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:39:00.920" style="s2">except that is much more coherent and well thought-through, than just a dream, which is often quite fragmentary</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.920" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s partly &#39;cause the dream is willing to sacrifice coherence to play with category structures</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:12.080" style="s2">you know, and that&#39;s why in dreams things can change one thing into another really weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.080" end="00:39:17.600" style="s2">or scenes can change from one scene into another without a logic, the logic gets loosened</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.600" end="00:39:20.820" style="s2">so that the expanse of your thinking can widen</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.820" end="00:39:26.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s dangerous to do that, and that&#39;s partly why you do it while you&#39;re asleep and paralyzed</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.060" end="00:39:34.620" style="s2">you know, you don&#39;t run around and act out your pseudopodal fantasies, where you&#39;re stretching yourself out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.620" end="00:39:39.420" style="s2">there&#39;s no risk, exactly, although it can be bad enough so you&#39;ll wake up in terror</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.420" end="00:39:43.380" style="s2">but that&#39;s better than being in a crocodile&#39;s mouth by a large margin</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.380" end="00:39:50.840" style="s2">anyways, back to these birds, these are used later in the movie as manifestations of the Holy Spirit, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.840" end="00:39:54.380" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s a standard Christian symbol, although, as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.380" end="00:39:59.420" style="s2">the dove often represents the Holy Spirit, and we&#39;ll talk about that  later</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.420" end="00:40:05.500" style="s2">but this movie has very strong pagan elements in it, as I mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.500" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">as opposed to strictly Christian symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s foreshadowing, and what it foreshadows is that, well, a new day has dawned</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">it&#39;s  the emergence of new consciousness, and everything last night went well, really well</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:25.660" style="s2">everything in the... let&#39;s call it the unconscious, say, after time stops, that all went well, and so the new day is full of promise</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.660" end="00:40:30.220" style="s2">and so, the birds are singing, and the sun is shining, and, like, hurray</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.220" end="00:40:38.200" style="s2">this is the next scene, right, so it sets the tenor for that scene just like the introductory song does</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.200" end="00:40:44.560" style="s2">so anyways, then you see all these kids playing and enthusiastic, so they&#39;re off to school</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.560" end="00:40:48.760" style="s2">which is presented in a positive light, and so that&#39;s where you get socialized</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.760" end="00:40:53.880" style="s2">so Pinokio&#39;s ready to go beyond the boundaries of the familial home</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.880" end="00:40:58.460" style="s2">and he&#39;s ready because his father prepared him, and his mother prepared him</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.460" end="00:41:01.980" style="s2">and so he goes off, and he&#39;s not going off alone, he&#39;s going with his conscience</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.980" end="00:41:07.600" style="s2">you can think about it, again, as the internalized representation of nature and society</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.600" end="00:41:11.580" style="s2">and so he&#39;s not going out there alone, even though he&#39;s not very good at it</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.580" end="00:41:17.560" style="s2">he&#39;s pretty excited about it, and so is Gepetto; see, Gepetto isn&#39;t standing there paralyzed with terror</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.560" end="00:41:24.060" style="s2">and the kid isn&#39;t phobic of the outside world, and so he&#39;s treating it as an adventure</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.060" end="00:41:29.940" style="s2">even though, well, it&#39;s an adventure, but adventures can be dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.940" end="00:41:39.320" style="s2">you can imagine a kid, especially one who&#39;s, like, high in neuroticism, who hasn&#39;t been encouraged sufficiently to overcome that, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.320" end="00:41:44.260" style="s2">their primary idea might be: well, what if the other kids don&#39;t like me</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.260" end="00:41:47.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a big one; what if the teachers don&#39;t like me, what if the other kids won&#39;t play with me</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.640" end="00:41:55.140" style="s2">it&#39;s like, yeah, what if, that&#39;s rough, man, and if you&#39;re not a playful kid, it could easily be the case</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.140" end="00:41:59.500" style="s2">so... but that&#39;s not Pinokio, he&#39;s like, spinning out, ready to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.500" end="00:42:06.540" style="s2">and so... good, good, he&#39;s got... naive, but enthusiastic, ok, well at least that gets the ball rolling</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.540" end="00:42:11.740" style="s2">now, you&#39;ve got these two evil creatures here, the fox and the cat</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.740" end="00:42:17.880" style="s2">I think this one&#39;s based on one of the Marx brothers, actually, Harpo Marx, who, I believe, never said anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.880" end="00:42:23.260" style="s2">but, be that as it may, they&#39;re these ne&#39;er-do-well characters, the fox in particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.260" end="00:42:33.980" style="s2">now fox is standard trickster animal, right, it&#39;s a... classic animal, maybe because it&#39;s good at hiding, and it&#39;s good at hunting</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.980" end="00:42:38.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t know exactly why, but coyotes are like that, too</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.020" end="00:42:43.020" style="s2">they&#39;re classic trickster animals, he&#39;s kinda like Wile E. Coyote, in fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.020" end="00:42:51.160" style="s2">you know, the Warner Brothers character who&#39;s genius at large, and whose arrogance continually gets him wallopped</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.160" end="00:42:59.540" style="s2">and this character has a lot of features like that, but he feigns being an English gentleman of the 1890s</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.540" end="00:43:06.500" style="s2">and pretends to be educated, and has a kinda high-blown way of talking, and he&#39;s a fraud through and through</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.500" end="00:43:15.720" style="s2">and he&#39;s got this sidekick who&#39;s barely there at all, and he doesn&#39;t treat him that well</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.720" end="00:43:20.780" style="s2">but he&#39;s got someone to lord it over, so that keeps his dominance hierarchy thing going well</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.780" end="00:43:25.760" style="s2">and the fact that he&#39;s like a second-rate companion, well, he never really notices that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.760" end="00:43:28.680" style="s2">although he&#39;ll treat him contemptuously whenever he gets a chance</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.680" end="00:43:35.580" style="s2">so anyways, they&#39;re walking down the street, and the fox is bragging away about some crooked thing that he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.580" end="00:43:41.100" style="s2">how he pulled the wool over someone&#39;s eyes, and he confuses that with wisdom and intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.100" end="00:43:44.940" style="s2">and one of the things that you see, this is worth knowing too, because</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.940" end="00:43:51.160" style="s2">if you&#39;re preyed upon by a psychopath, which you will be to some degree at some point in your life</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.160" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">the psychopath, who will be narcissistic, will presume that you&#39;re stupid</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">and that you deserve to be taken advantage of, because you&#39;re naive and stupid, so it&#39;s actually a good thing that he&#39;s doing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">and his proof... and I&#39;m saying &quot;he,&quot; because there are more male psychopaths</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:14.200" style="s2">the proof that you&#39;re stupid and naive is that he can take advantage of you</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.200" end="00:44:18.840" style="s2">and so, like, if you were wiser, you&#39;d be a, you know, you&#39;d know his tricks</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.840" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">then it wouldn&#39;t be morally necessary for him to show you just exactly who knows what about what</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:36.100" style="s2">and so, the psychopath will use his ability  to fool you as proof of his own grandiose omnipotence, omniscience, and narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.100" end="00:44:41.740" style="s2">and the problem with that is that you can be fooled by a psychopath, and virtually anybody can</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.740" end="00:44:45.840" style="s2">so that Robert Hare, for example, who&#39;s studied psychopaths for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.840" end="00:44:51.000" style="s2">and interviewed a lot of them, like hundreds of them, and videotaped many of the interviews</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.000" end="00:44:53.880" style="s2">he said when he was talking to the psychopath he always believed what they were saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.880" end="00:44:58.540" style="s2">and then he&#39;s watch the video afterwards, and see where the conversation went off the rails</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.540" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">but, you know, the proclivity to be polite in a conversation is very strong</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:12.200" style="s2">and if you&#39;re polite, you don&#39;t object to the way that the person unfolds their strategy, you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.200" end="00:45:17.840" style="s2">and psychopaths are pretty good at figuring out how to manipulate, obviously, how to manipulate people</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.840" end="00:45:21.500" style="s2">and the probability that you will be immune to that is extraordinarily low</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.500" end="00:45:26.140" style="s2">go watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed by policemen on the Youtube</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.140" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s bloody... that&#39;s enlightening, man, Paul Bernardo, he&#39;s like the CEO of a meeting in that video</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:40.920" style="s2">he gives the cops hell, he gives the lawyers hell, he protests his innocence, he basically tells them that they&#39;re rude and untrustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.920" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">because they don&#39;t trust him, because he did a few little things seventeen years ago</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:52.360" style="s2">and he gets away with the few little things, right, I mean he killed a bunch of people, including the sister of his girlfriend at the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.360" end="00:45:55.800" style="s2">and you know, he was a repeat sexual offender, and murderer</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.800" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">but he basically goes: you know, that&#39;s a long time ago, it&#39;s like, we&#39;re past that, aren&#39;t we?</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:08.340" style="s2">I mean, I&#39;m having a discussion with you, I&#39;m trying to help you solve some crimes, which, by the way, I committed, but we won&#39;t bring that up</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.340" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">you know, and you&#39;re accusing me of being a liar, you&#39;re not playing fair, what&#39;s up with you?</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">and then when they answer, he looks at his fingernails, which is, like, that&#39;s a lovely little manipulative thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">&#39;cause it basically means: whatever happens to be under my fingernail at the moment is much higher priority than your foolish story</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:30.820" style="s2">and you watch, you&#39;ll see people do that to you, and then you get a little insight into what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.820" end="00:46:37.100" style="s2">he&#39;s very good at that; or he looks outside, or he just looks at his hands, or he looks out the window</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.100" end="00:46:41.340" style="s2">immediately dismissive in his nonverbal behavior, it&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.340" end="00:46:47.820" style="s2">the courts were forced to release that, by the way, look it up, Paul Bernardo on Youtube</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.820" end="00:46:52.320" style="s2">wow, it&#39;s jus mind-boggling, he&#39;s so good at what he does</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.320" end="00:46:56.380" style="s2">and he&#39;s good-looking, and he&#39;s charismatic, and, you know, he can really pull it off</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.380" end="00:47:02.920" style="s2">and you can&#39;t tell what&#39;s happening with the cops and the lawyers, whether they&#39;re just letting him play his routine to get some information from him</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.920" end="00:47:07.260" style="s2">or whether he&#39;s actually setting them back on his heels, and I suspect it&#39;s a bit of both</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.260" end="00:47:14.140" style="s2">but it&#39;s a masterful performance; if you didn&#39;t know who he was, and you were watching it without the audio</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.140" end="00:47:19.660" style="s2">you&#39;d think he&#39;s the CEO of some company giving his employees hell for not being up to scratch</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.660" end="00:47:25.340" style="s2">that&#39;s all his body language, his eye contact, everything, just speaks that, it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.340" end="00:47:30.280" style="s2">so anyways, you got these two-bit hoods here, who think they&#39;re really something</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.280" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">and they also think they&#39;re tough and dangerous, and they&#39;re not, they&#39;re just, you know, cowardly corner dwellers</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:44.220" style="s2">and they confuse their unwillingness to abide by reasonable rules with an indication of their heroic courage</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.220" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">which is something else that low-rent hoods like to do, you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:52.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s partly because lots of people who just attend to the law do do that because they&#39;re cowardly</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.900" end="00:47:56.940" style="s2">which is a Nietzschean observation, are you good? or are you just afraid?</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.940" end="00:48:04.920" style="s2">let&#39;s start with afraid first, before we proceed to good, and that the reason you follow the rules is that you&#39;re afraid of getting caught</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.920" end="00:48:11.480" style="s2">yeah, well, you know those kids who... often university kids who are in a hockey riot</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.480" end="00:48:20.180" style="s2">and breaking windows, and stealing things, you know, they get nailed for it, and afterwards they&#39;re really blown away by their own behavior</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.180" end="00:48:26.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like, well, they&#39;re in that camp, they think they are good people, but they&#39;re not, they&#39;re just never anywhere where you could be bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.860" end="00:48:31.600" style="s2">and as soon as you put them somewhere, where they could be bad, it&#39;s like, out it comes, just like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.600" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s really worth thinking about, &#39;cause most of you, many of you, but not all of you, I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">have never really been somewhere that you could be really bad and get away with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:51.060" style="s2">and so you might think, well, you wouldn&#39;t do it, but people do it, all the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.060" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">so anyways, they&#39;re talking about some exploits, and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:49:00.040" style="s2">then they see that this character named Stomboli, he has a puppet show, right</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.040" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">and he&#39;s kind of a wheeler-dealer too</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">remember, I showed you that mas that was glaring at Pinokio when he got his voice?</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like, Stromboli is one of his manifestations, the fox here is another one of his manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:20.120" style="s2">all the negative characters throughout the movie are manifestations of the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.120" end="00:49:25.260" style="s2">it&#39;s partly the adversarial individual, and it&#39;s partly the tyrrannical aspect of society</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:28.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the negative masculine, that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.760" end="00:49:33.940" style="s2">so, and you know, when men go bad, they often go bad by being antisocial and tyrrannical</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.940" end="00:49:40.520" style="s2">there&#39;s way more antisocial men than there antisocial women, which is why there&#39;s twenty times as many men in jail as there are women</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.520" end="00:49:46.640" style="s2">so each gender, let&#39;s say each sex has it&#39;s own characteristic pathologies</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.640" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">and there are some antisocial women, you know, and there are some high-neuroticism guys</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:57.600" style="s2">or some guys who are really agreeable as well, but they&#39;re rare</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.600" end="00:50:05.180" style="s2">so anyways, he sees this poster advertising Stromboli&#39;s puppet show</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.180" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">so Stromboli&#39;s a puppet master; now that&#39;s really worth thinking about, because that&#39;s an archetypal theme</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">or it&#39;s at least attached to an archetypal theme: something&#39;s behind the scenes, pulling the strings</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:25.360" style="s2">and everyone always wonders what that is, what&#39;s actually going on; what&#39;s actually going on with Trump?</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.360" end="00:50:32.580" style="s2">who&#39;s actually in control? is it Putin? I mean that&#39;s the fantasies of the left, it&#39;s Putin</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.580" end="00:50:38.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like, well, the question always is, what&#39;s going on behind the scene</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.100" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">right, and the question is... that&#39;s the case certainly on the political landscape, business landscape, interpersonal relations</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">what are you really up to, everyone&#39;s always wondering that, right, it&#39;s why they&#39;re watching you eyes</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:57.600" style="s2">&#39;cause your eyes point at things, and they can infer what you&#39;re interested in, and what you&#39;re up to by looking at what you look at</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.600" end="00:51:03.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s why your eyes have whites, it&#39;s so that we can see where you&#39;re pointing them, &#39;cause gorillas don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.620" end="00:51:10.940" style="s2">and so what that means, roughly speaking, is that all of your ancestors whose eyes couldn&#39;t be reliably tracked</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.940" end="00:51:17.360" style="s2">were either killed or didn&#39;t mate, it&#39;s a big deal for us to see where people&#39;s eyes are pointed</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.360" end="00:51:21.500" style="s2">and so we&#39;re always watching each other&#39;s eyes, constantly; what are you up to, what are you up to?</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.500" end="00:51:27.320" style="s2">what are you looking at? what do you want? I wanna know, because if I know what you want, I can predict how you&#39;re gonna behave</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.320" end="00:51:32.680" style="s2">and that also means I can cooperate with you, or I can compete with you, or I can lie to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.680" end="00:51:40.780" style="s2">but all the information is in the eyes, surrounded by the facial display, right, &#39;cause that&#39;s also an indication of motivation and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.780" end="00:51:49.380" style="s2">our eyes are so good at that, that for you guys sitting there in the back, I can tell if you&#39;re looking at my eyes or at my chin</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.380" end="00:51:57.800" style="s2">and the deviation in your eyes is so tiny, that it&#39;s a kind of miracle that we&#39;re capable of making that perceptual observation</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.800" end="00:52:02.660" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to us, so and we have really good eyes, so that&#39;s another thing about us</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.660" end="00:52:09.940" style="s2">so anyways, what&#39;s going on behind the scenes? well, if you look at Stromboli, you might be thinking:</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.940" end="00:52:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear he&#39;s someone you&#39;d want to have pulling your strings</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:21.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit of, forced ethusiasm, let&#39;s say, there, and he&#39;s just not a very savory looking character</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.460" end="00:52:28.660" style="s2">so anyways, the fox knows him, and they start talking about Stromboli, that old joker</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.660" end="00:52:34.040" style="s2">how they could possibly involve him in some sort of scam, because he&#39;s back in town</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.040" end="00:52:39.720" style="s2">and then they see the puppet, and the fox does his equivalent of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.720" end="00:52:43.880" style="s2">which is, you know, pretty sad and nasty, but that&#39;s what he does</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.880" end="00:52:47.800" style="s2">and then they see this puppet with no strings, and they think: hey man</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.800" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">a puppet master would pay a lot for something that is capable of semi-autonomous movement like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:58.160" style="s2">it would be kind of a miracle; and so they decide that they would take him to Stromboli</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.160" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">and so they grab him, and, hah, he&#39;s got an apple to take to the teacher, which, I think it&#39;s the cat, promptly eats</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:16.940" style="s2">and the fox acts out this false enthusiasm about what Pinokio is up to, and pretends that he&#39;s his friend</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.940" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">which is of course what your typical pedophile will do, and so this is in the same kind of category</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:29.140" style="s2">and it truly is; one of the things that&#39;s interesting to know about pedophiles is that they&#39;re predatory, right</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.140" end="00:53:36.340" style="s2">and so they don&#39;t go after kids that are assertive and likely to be noisy</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.340" end="00:53:42.680" style="s2">they watch, and they watch to see if they can find a kid who&#39;s defeated, and...</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.680" end="00:53:49.380" style="s2">that&#39;s good enough, who&#39;s defeated, and who&#39;s gonna need a friend, and who&#39;s not going to object</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.380" end="00:53:54.560" style="s2">and so when they check out... these are the ones who do the stranger abductions, which are, by the way, extraordinarily rare</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.560" end="00:54:00.020" style="s2">they look for a victim type, they look for a kid who&#39;s gonna be easy to take down</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.020" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">and so, you know, that&#39;s one thing you don&#39;t want... so you might think, well...</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:10.560" style="s2">one of the things that was really big, it&#39;s probably even worse now, when I was a parent of young children</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.560" end="00:54:19.140" style="s2">was to teach your kids how to be afraid of strangers, it&#39;s like, uh, no, wrong, that is not what you teach them</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.140" end="00:54:27.240" style="s2">because all you do is teach them then to be timid and fearful, and the real predatory types, they&#39;re pretty much thrilled about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.240" end="00:54:31.080" style="s2">&#39;cause you&#39;ll also make them sheltered and naive</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.080" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">you make your kids courageous, and you get their damn eyes open, and that&#39;s the best thing you can do against people who are truly dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:44.680" style="s2">so, none of that terrifying... it&#39;s not a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.680" end="00:54:52.700" style="s2">anyways, the fox befriends the puppet, and then they come up with this evil scheme to get him off to Stromboli, the puppet master</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.700" end="00:54:58.380" style="s2">and away they go, and they sing a little song about being an actor, &quot;an actor&#39;s life for me&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.380" end="00:55:04.840" style="s2">this took me along time to figure out, I thought: they&#39;re taking Pinokio away to be an actor</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.840" end="00:55:09.940" style="s2">now why in the world are actors getting such a rough time in this movie?</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.940" end="00:55:16.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like, it&#39;s a Hollywood movie, you know, it&#39;s acting, obviously, the voiceovers and all of that are acting</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.940" end="00:55:23.100" style="s2">it&#39;s... why is this thing about being an actor? and then I thought: oh, I get it, I see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.100" end="00:55:29.220" style="s2">they sing to Pinokio about the delights of unearned celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.220" end="00:55:33.780" style="s2">so he doesn&#39;t have to go and get an education, he doesn&#39;t have to take the difficult route</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.780" end="00:55:40.680" style="s2">he can take the easy way to dominance... to success, to dominance success</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.680" end="00:55:48.220" style="s2">he can circumvent all the hard work and go right to the top, you know, and when you think about phenomena like the Kardashian family</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.220" end="00:55:54.500" style="s2">and how popular they are, part of that is this desire that people have for unearned celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.500" end="00:56:00.060" style="s2">because you can ge to the top without any sacrifices and without any work, and if you&#39;re really cynical</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.060" end="00:56:05.420" style="s2">you know, you think that the people at the top are just there by accident anyways, and it might as well be you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.420" end="00:56:13.420" style="s2">of course, there&#39;s a lot of naivety in that as well, and a fair bit of, you know... a fair lack of wisdom and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.420" end="00:56:19.380" style="s2">but the actor idea here is that you can pretend to be something you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.380" end="00:56:25.020" style="s2">and that that&#39;s the proper route of anyone wise to success, it&#39;s the ultimate in cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.020" end="00:56:29.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s a nihilistic perspective as well, and that&#39;s how they entrap him</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.980" end="00:56:34.840" style="s2">they say: look, why are you bothering to go to school? that&#39;s gonna take 18 years</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.840" end="00:56:40.600" style="s2">with all of your talents you could just go on the stage, your name will be up in lights, you&#39;ll be at the top in no time</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.600" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">and what does the puppet know? plust he does have some talents, he is, after all, a semi-autonomous puppet</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:52.760" style="s2">now, he doesn&#39;t exactly know how special that makes him, but the fox can obviously see something in him</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.760" end="00:56:57.840" style="s2">and he&#39;s good at playing that naivety off, and then offering these false promises</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.840" end="00:57:03.260" style="s2">but, see, the thing is... one of the things that Carl Jung said, that I thought  was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.260" end="00:57:07.360" style="s2">when he was talking about the Edipal situation in families, I never forgot this</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.360" end="00:57:12.900" style="s2">so the Edipal situation, roughly speaking, is when - I&#39;ll lay out the classic story -</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.900" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">is when a child is seriously overprotected, usually a male child by his mother</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:22.220" style="s2">now, the reverse can be the case, and it can be a female child by the mother, and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.220" end="00:57:25.160" style="s2">but I&#39;ll just talk about the classic case to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.160" end="00:57:30.380" style="s2">now, what Freud observed was that there were usually not very good boundaries in families like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.380" end="00:57:35.320" style="s2">and so, the relationship between the husband and the wife was either strained or nonexistent</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.320" end="00:57:40.420" style="s2">and the wife would often turn to the child to be what she isn&#39;t getting from the husband</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.420" end="00:57:46.000" style="s2">and so, there&#39;s a great South Park episode about this, a wonderful South Park episode</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.000" end="00:57:52.740" style="s2">where... I don&#39;t remember that horrible little guy <br />[student: Cartman] <br />yeah, that&#39;s him</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.740" end="00:57:59.020" style="s2">his mother brings in the dog whisperer to train him, and it&#39;s a brilliant episode</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.020" end="00:58:04.780" style="s2">if you want to learn about the freudian edipal situation, you watch that, you&#39;ve got it down cold</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.780" end="00:58:09.300" style="s2">because she brings in this expert, who then she wants to have an affair with, so that&#39;s a boundary issue</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.300" end="00:58:18.020" style="s2">and he basically separates her son from him [sic], and imposes the same discipline on him, that he would impose on a bad dog</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.020" end="00:58:24.300" style="s2">although he also trains the dog&#39;s owners all the time, because maybe it&#39;s not the dog, maybe it&#39;s the owner</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.300" end="00:58:30.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a horse whisperer movie, too, about the original horse whisperer that does a beautiful job of laying that out, too</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.040" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">&#39;cause he&#39;s very good at fixing problem horses, and unbelivably good at diagnosing psychopathology on the part of the owner</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:40.440" style="s2">he&#39;s got a gift for it, but...</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.440" end="00:58:47.600" style="s2">anyways, what happens in the South Park episode is that the dog whisperer gets Cartman straightened out</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.600" end="00:58:51.220" style="s2">and he starts, like, dressing properly, and doing his homework, and...</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.220" end="00:58:55.320" style="s2">and the mother is pursuing an affair with the dog whisperer, but he&#39;s professional</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.320" end="00:58:58.600" style="s2">he keeps his distance, he keeps boundaries around him</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.600" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">and then he leaves, and then the first thing that she does when he leaves</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:11.000" style="s2">is bribe Cartman, basically, out of doing his homework, so that he can accompany her to, I don&#39;t know, a fast food restaurant or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.000" end="00:59:15.580" style="s2">and so, the reason she does that is &#39;cause she&#39;s lonesome, and doesn&#39;t have anybody else around</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.580" end="00:59:22.620" style="s2">and, you know, maybe she&#39;s also deeply, deeply, deeply terrified that if she helps that boy grow up, he will leave</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.620" end="00:59:24.620" style="s2">and she&#39;ll have nothing</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.620" end="00:59:29.640" style="s2">you know, and so, mothers who don&#39;t have something, say, outside their infants</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.640" end="00:59:33.640" style="s2">not merely their children, are more likely to fall into that, and it&#39;s no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.640" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">you know, you gotta think that through; and lots of women, most women, really fall in love with their babies</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:45.480" style="s2">and so, even if they start growing into larger children that can be threatening</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.480" end="00:59:53.020" style="s2">because when the child... when the infant turns into a toddler, the infant is dead</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.020" end="01:00:00.440" style="s2">the toddler is there now; and you can radically interfere with that process, that happens all the time</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.440" end="01:00:03.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the classic Freudian oedipal nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.400" end="01:00:07.480" style="s2">and that episode is brilliant, it&#39;s bloody brilliant, it just nails it</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.480" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">some of you&#39;ve been in my personality class and watched &quot;Crumb&quot;, the documentary &quot;Crumb&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:17.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s another staggering exposition of exactly that kind of pathology</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.240" end="01:00:20.520" style="s2">anyways, one of the things Jung pointed out...</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.520" end="01:00:25.720" style="s2">so I knew this guys once, who had a mother who basically was trying that trick</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.720" end="01:00:31.560" style="s2">and she was very smart, and had lots of tricks up her sleeves, and there was just no way he was gonna go for it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.560" end="01:00:37.400" style="s2">he rebelled at every possible moment, and he basically became, I would say, somewhat hypermasculine in response</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.400" end="01:00:43.940" style="s2">which is an interesting lesson with regards to the hypermasculinity that boys often develop when they&#39;re raised by single mothers</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.940" end="01:00:46.140" style="s2">&#39;cause they tend to go one of two ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.140" end="01:00:50.300" style="s2">and he just fought her at every step of the way, and it didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.300" end="01:00:55.400" style="s2">but one of the things Jung said, which I loved, and you can really see this in the &quot;Crumb&quot; documentary</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.400" end="01:01:00.380" style="s2">is that the oedipal mother basically entices the child, she says: look</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.380" end="01:01:05.960" style="s2">here&#39;s the deal, you don&#39;t have to do anything, but you don&#39;t get to leave</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.960" end="01:01:10.260" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t leave, and you don&#39;t to these difficult things, then I&#39;ll take care of you</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.260" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">and the child has a choice, all the way along there, I mean, obviously he&#39;s outclassed in some sense, but it&#39;s not as obvious as you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">little kids are tough, and they make decisions all the time</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.720" end="01:01:26.120" style="s2">and so Jung thought about it more as a conspiracy than as something imposed on the child by the mother</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.120" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">and I really like that, it&#39;s actually a conspiracy between mother, father, and child, actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:34.140" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s a good way of looking at it, even though it&#39;s really rough, &#39;cause</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.140" end="01:01:40.560" style="s2">well, should you hold the child responsible? well, yes, but judiciously, and not completely</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.560" end="01:01:45.220" style="s2">&#39;cause then if you deal with someone like that as an adult, and they&#39;re trying to escape from it</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.220" end="01:01:49.140" style="s2">you have to go all the way back and figure out how the hell it happened</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.140" end="01:01:54.560" style="s2">they have to figure out where they opened the door, like inviting a vampire in</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.560" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">&#39;cause they can&#39;t come in unless you invite them in, so don&#39;t invite them in</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">&#39;cause once they&#39;re in they&#39;re really hard to  get rid of, and they&#39;ll take all your blood</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s a cautionary tale</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:11.380" style="s2">so anyways, Pinokio doesn&#39;t know any better, and he&#39;s got the egotism of youth</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.380" end="01:02:17.860" style="s2">he&#39;s offered the easy way to success, which is exactly what the fox tells him, and off they go to see Stromboli</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.860" end="01:02:22.300" style="s2">so this is this song, I&#39;m not gonna read it all</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.300" end="01:02:28.080" style="s2">it&#39;s great to be a celebrity, an actor&#39;s life for me</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.080" end="01:02:34.280" style="s2">you sleep till after two<br />you promenade a big cigar<br />you tour the world in a private car</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.280" end="01:02:37.440" style="s2">you dine on chicken and caviar<br />an actor&#39;s life for me!</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.440" end="01:02:41.640" style="s2">it&#39;s all this idea of wealth and public exposure</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.640" end="01:02:47.620" style="s2">and zero attention whatsoever to anything regarding responsibility or discipline or learning</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.620" end="01:02:52.840" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a dual attraction, right, you get everything you want, and you don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.840" end="01:02:58.140" style="s2">geez, what a deal; and so that&#39;s what the actor represents, it&#39;s a liar, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.140" end="01:03:03.740" style="s2">it&#39;s someone who&#39;s acting out a deception, they&#39;re a persona in the Jungian sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.740" end="01:03:11.140" style="s2">so the persona is the mask you wear in public that you might even think you are. but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.140" end="01:03:14.360" style="s2">it&#39;s this mask, and that&#39;s the actor, that&#39;s the persona</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.360" end="01:03:20.320" style="s2">so the fox and the cat are inviting the puppet to only become a persona</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.320" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">see, for Jung, you start as a persona, and then, when you start to investigate the parts of you that don&#39;t really fit in that persona</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:34.280" style="s2">and that would be the shadow, then you start understanding who you really are</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.280" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s shocking, because the persona contains everything, roughly speaking, that you think is good</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:43.200" style="s2">and maybe even that your immediate culture thinks is good</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.200" end="01:03:46.140" style="s2">and then the shadow contains everything&#39;s that&#39;s not part of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.140" end="01:03:52.100" style="s2">and some of that&#39;s really bad, but some of it is good disguised as bad</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.100" end="01:03:58.220" style="s2">and you can&#39;t break out of the persona and transcend it until you incorporate a lot of what&#39;s in the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.220" end="01:04:04.180" style="s2">and so, for example, it you&#39;re and extrordinarily compassionate person, let&#39;s say 98th percentile</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.180" end="01:04:08.440" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be sacrificing yourself to other people all the time</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.440" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">and there are people who will find that extraordinarily endearing</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:17.560" style="s2">and it will be, under some circumstances, but the problem is that you will sacrifice yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.560" end="01:04:21.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really bad attitude to have, for example, towards adult males</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.540" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a great thing for infants, but for adult males it is *the* wrong approach</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:33.040" style="s2">you will get taken advantage of continually by people who are looking for someone like you, until you grow some teeth</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.040" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">and you&#39;ll think: no, no, that&#39;s the opposite of compassion, being able to bite hard is the opposite of compassion</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:45.060" style="s2">which it is; and so you&#39;ll have that pushed into the predator category</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.060" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">&quot;I&#39;m not doing that, I&#39;m not getting angry, I don&#39;t like conflict&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.300" end="01:04:55.100" style="s2">until you bring that out of the depths and put it on, so you can use it, you&#39;re gonna be in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.160" end="01:04:58.700" style="s2">and that&#39;s kinda Nietzsche&#39;s idea of the revaluation of good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.700" end="01:05:04.580" style="s2">you have a sense of what&#39;s good, and a sense of what isn&#39;t with your conscience, but it&#39;s not very smart</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.580" end="01:05:08.860" style="s2">it&#39;s got things in the wrong boxes, even nature itself</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.860" end="01:05:14.040" style="s2">a lot of the things that you accept as untrammeled goods, like compassion, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.040" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">have a very dark side, first of all, and second, are not enough to get you through life</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:23.340" style="s2">you need the opposite virtues, too, and so you have to develop them</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.340" end="01:05:27.560" style="s2">you get outside the persona to do that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.560" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">but anyways, Pinokio&#39;s invited to be a false persona to take the gains of celebrity</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:39.740" style="s2">without having to do anything to be educated, he&#39;s just gonna go right to the top from right where he is</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.740" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">and you know, people are kinda fascinated by that idea, that&#39;s why you watch America&#39;s Got Talent</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:49.160" style="s2">or the X-Factor, which shows I actually love, by the way</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.160" end="01:05:57.980" style="s2">you never see narcissism in its purer forms than you see it when you watch people who display an absolute lack of talent</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.980" end="01:06:01.480" style="s2">and become homicidal when someone dares point it out</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.480" end="01:06:06.040" style="s2">accusatory and homicidal, instantly, it&#39;s really something</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.060" end="01:06:12.460" style="s2">and then, now and then, you do see one of these people who&#39;s so introverted, and so out of society</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.460" end="01:06:17.000" style="s2">and have this unbelievable gift, which is also something really remarkable to see</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.000" end="01:06:23.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s no wonder these things are so popular, they&#39;re psychologically extraordinarily interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.580" end="01:06:30.660" style="s2">so that&#39;s the actor, first of Pinokio&#39;s temptations, and of course it&#39;s the first one, because he&#39;s entering the social world</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.660" end="01:06:35.400" style="s2">and the temptation in the social world is to be exactly what other people want you to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.400" end="01:06:39.000" style="s2">and the thing that&#39;s cool about that is that is what you should be doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.000" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">when you go out in your peers, you should be not subjugating your individuality to your peers, &#39;cause that&#39;s not exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:52.620" style="s2">that&#39;s kinda based on an inhibition model, you&#39;ve got aggression, you&#39;ve got bad habits, they have to be inhibited</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.620" end="01:06:58.300" style="s2">you learn that by interacting with your peers;<br />it&#39;s not the right model, that&#39;s a Freudian model</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.300" end="01:07:03.160" style="s2">Piaget was correct about that, he basically pointed out that what should happen is</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.160" end="01:07:08.300" style="s2">let&#39;s say, with your aggression, and hopefully you have some, is that it gets socialized</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.300" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">you learn how to play games, but you don&#39;t drop your drive to win, you integrate that in the games</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:20.900" style="s2">you try to win, you try to play hard, but if you&#39;re defeated or you hit something negative, you don&#39;t respond negatively</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.900" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">and you can keep that all bounded within being a good player, a fair player</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:31.580" style="s2">and that means what&#39;s happened is you learned how to play a game or a set of games</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.580" end="01:07:37.100" style="s2">that also includes the darker parts of you, and they actually become part of your force of character</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.100" end="01:07:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s way better if you can pull that off, and that&#39;s what you definitely wanna do as an adult</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.920" end="01:07:47.660" style="s2">all you people are gonna have to learn to negotiate on your own behalf, and that&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.660" end="01:07:54.600" style="s2">it means that you have to know what you want, you have to be able to communicate it, and you have to be able to say &quot;no&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.600" end="01:07:59.960" style="s2">and to say &quot;no&quot; you have to be built on a solid foundation, you have to have options</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.960" end="01:08:02.620" style="s2">so you gotta remember that as you go through your life</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.620" end="01:08:08.480" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have options, you can&#39;t negotiate with someone, and if you&#39;re not willing to use them, they win, period</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:14.140" style="s2">because if you&#39;re asking your boss for more money, say, the answer is no</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.140" end="01:08:20.560" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t have any spare money lying around that he can just give to you, and lots of other people are asking</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.560" end="01:08:27.120" style="s2">so some of that zero-sum stuff, not all of it, because often you cooperate with people, and the whole pot can grow</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.120" end="01:08:31.340" style="s2">but some of it&#39;s zero-sum, and so you better have a case made</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.340" end="01:08:39.240" style="s2">&quot;here&#39;s how much money I should have, here&#39;s why, here&#39;s the benefit to you if you do it</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.240" end="01:08:45.600" style="s2">here&#39;s the consequences if you don&#39;t, they&#39;re actually real, they will cost you, and I will do them&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:51.900" style="s2">then you can negotiate, and you don&#39;t do that rudely, but those arguments, you better have them in order</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.900" end="01:08:56.580" style="s2">for example, if you&#39;re gonna negotiate for a raise or a status shift</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.580" end="01:09:03.600" style="s2">you better have your resume at hand, all polished up, and know where else you&#39;re gonna look for a job, and you better be able to get one</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.600" end="01:09:07.980" style="s2">&#39;cause otherwise you&#39;re weak, and you will not win the negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.980" end="01:09:14.600" style="s2">and if you&#39;re too agreeable, so your conflict-avoidant, you will make less money across time</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.600" end="01:09:20.300" style="s2">that&#39;s already been well established, and that&#39;s because you don&#39;t have teeth, not enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.300" end="01:09:25.100" style="s2">and so, in the little micro-contest that you&#39;re going to have every day</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.100" end="01:09:29.200" style="s2">you&#39;re going to incrementally lose to people who are more aggressive</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.200" end="01:09:36.420" style="s2">who have bigger teeth, and that&#39;s what happens, so don&#39;t let that happen</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.420" end="01:09:43.640" style="s2">you place yourselves so you can negotiate, &#39;cause otherwise you&#39;re just a facade</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.640" end="01:09:52.580" style="s2">and in a real battle a facade is just torn down right away</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.580" end="01:09:59.540" style="s2">well, the cricket, he&#39;s supposed to be helping the puppet out, but he overslept</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.540" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">that&#39;s just another indication that he&#39;s not everything he could be yet, and that&#39;s really...</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:08.860" style="s2">that took me a long time to puzzle out with regards to interpreting this movie</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.860" end="01:10:15.140" style="s2">I could not figure out, I told you this, if the bug is the person who opens the hero narrative</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.140" end="01:10:20.720" style="s2">and who can guide the transformations of time and who has the same initials as Jesus Chris</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.720" end="01:10:24.820" style="s2">and is knighted by nature herself,<br />why is he such an idiot?</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.820" end="01:10:31.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a very difficult thing to figure out, but the idea that the conscience isn&#39;t omniscient</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.160" end="01:10:35.300" style="s2">even though it has that voice of, let&#39;s say, common sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.300" end="01:10:41.980" style="s2">and that fits very nicely in with the Freudian idea of the superego, again, because the superego can be flawed</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.980" end="01:10:45.880" style="s2">it can be too harsh, it can not be properly developed</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.880" end="01:10:53.280" style="s2">you see that often with people who are orderly, so they&#39;re high in conscientiousness, conscientiousness fragments into industriousness and orderliness</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.280" end="01:10:59.280" style="s2">orderly people like willpower, they&#39;re very judgmental, and they like things to be exactly where they&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.280" end="01:11:05.440" style="s2">but they&#39;re also very self-punitive; conservatives are much more likely to be orderly, by the way</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.440" end="01:11:12.820" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the best predictors of conservatism; low openness is the best predictor, but right after that is high orderliness</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.820" end="01:11:20.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s associated with disgust sensitivity, which is really an amazing thing, we&#39;ll talk about that later</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.820" end="01:11:26.320" style="s2">anyways, the cricket, he falls down his first day on the job</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.320" end="01:11:33.140" style="s2">he&#39;s not as conscientious a conscience as he should be</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.140" end="01:11:39.640" style="s2">so he&#39;s feeling pretty stupid, he&#39;s got his little millionaire clothes on, but he&#39;s really not living up to them</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.640" end="01:11:48.560" style="s2">he does catch up to the fox and the puppet, however, and tries to dissuade Pinokio from going down this road</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.560" end="01:11:54.020" style="s2">and of course, the cat, well, you can see what the cat&#39;s doing there, he&#39;s got a big hammer</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.020" end="01:11:59.380" style="s2">big mallet, and he&#39;s... it also shows you just exactly how much of a clue he has</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.380" end="01:12:04.120" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna wallop the bug who&#39;s sitting on the fox&#39;s hat, which I think he actually does</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.120" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">then the fox can&#39;t get out of his hat, and has to talk through his hat, which basically he&#39;s doing all the time anyways</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:19.340" style="s2">so, this I really like, you see on the left here that the cricket is speaking inside this flower</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.340" end="01:12:24.620" style="s2">and like I said, there&#39;s nothing accidental in these representations</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.620" end="01:12:30.020" style="s2">these are artists who were coming up with these compositions, and their fantasy has a structure</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.020" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">so the cricket is speaking out of this flower that has, well, you could think about it as... it has a sexualized element</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:43.420" style="s2">so you could think about that as a phallic part, and that part of the feminine part of it, they are flowers, after all</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.420" end="01:12:50.700" style="s2">they are the sex organs of plants, and that&#39;s very much the same over here, this is the yoni and lingam</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.700" end="01:12:58.220" style="s2">this is from Hindu culture, and you see there&#39;s a snake wrapped around that, so that&#39;s masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.220" end="01:13:04.080" style="s2">with a snake wrapped around it, and that&#39;s a holy representation, a sacred representation</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.080" end="01:13:09.300" style="s2">and it represents the deepst reality, that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.300" end="01:13:13.440" style="s2">like chaos and order, surrounded by the snake, it&#39;s exactly the same idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.440" end="01:13:18.960" style="s2">so the cricket speaks out of that; well we already know that, &#39;cause it is the conscience</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.960" end="01:13:26.160" style="s2">and he&#39;s been awakened in part by Gepetto and the good father, and awakened in part by the good fairy and nature</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.160" end="01:13:33.780" style="s2">so he speaks with those voices, and he&#39;s also a manifestation of the underlying chaos itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.780" end="01:13:36.920" style="s2">because nature and culture spring out of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.920" end="01:13:41.720" style="s2">I already showed you that schematic representation</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.720" end="01:13:48.240" style="s2">I&#39;ll just end this scene, and then we&#39;ll have a 15-minute break, okay?</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.240" end="01:13:54.920" style="s2">anyways, the cricket tires to make a case for why Pinokio shouldn&#39;t go off to be a celebrity</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.920" end="01:14:02.600" style="s2">but, you know, it&#39;s a hard case to make, because the fox is very manipulative, and Pinokio is naive</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.600" end="01:14:08.580" style="s2">and it sounds like a good offer, and also the fox is actually quite forceful, he basically takes him by the hand</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.580" end="01:14:13.340" style="s2">so the temptation is, and this is something else I like about the movie</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.340" end="01:14:16.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t just say: &quot;well, the puppet gets what he deserves&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.800" end="01:14:23.160" style="s2">&#39;cause he&#39;s little and naive, and what he&#39;s facing is really malevolent, truly malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.160" end="01:14:31.320" style="s2">and physically overpowering, and so the movie does a nice job of not minimizing the threat that&#39;s posed by this particular temptation</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.320" end="01:14:34.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of what makes it art</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.180" end="01:14:40.380" style="s2">so we&#39;ll stop there, we&#39;ll have a break for 15 minutes, and then we&#39;ll start with the stage</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.380" end="01:14:47.540" style="s2">alright, so here we are, at the big event, and Pinokio is off to be a celebrity</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.540" end="01:14:55.220" style="s2">and the cricket is watching, and Pinokio basically...</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.220" end="01:15:00.100" style="s2">well, he&#39;s got some natural talent, because he&#39;s a puppet, but he doesn&#39;t have strings</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.100" end="01:15:05.020" style="s2">he goes on stage with strings, and then he drops his strings, and the whole crowd is amazed</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.020" end="01:15:10.300" style="s2">and the crowd should be amazed when that happens; you can imagine when a kid goes to school</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.300" end="01:15:19.400" style="s2">and shows some independence, that that&#39;s actually gonna... people are gonna notice that</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.400" end="01:15:23.000" style="s2">his peers are gonna notice that, the teachers are gonna notice that</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.000" end="01:15:27.740" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s too much independence even, but it&#39;s still a... it is a remarkable thing, too</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.740" end="01:15:35.460" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting, you can see marked signs of independence in children, well, right from the time they&#39;re born, basically</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.460" end="01:15:41.160" style="s2">because one of the things that&#39;s really funny about the infants, is when they&#39;re crying, you always think:</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.160" end="01:15:47.800" style="s2">&quot;oh, the baby&#39;s sad&quot;, it&#39;s like, no, a lot of the time that baby is angry</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.800" end="01:15:56.320" style="s2">and the way that we know that is because you can do facial expression coding on infants, just like on adults</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.320" end="01:15:59.740" style="s2">and you can tell what emotion they&#39;re expressing, and very frequently...</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.740" end="01:16:03.780" style="s2">like when a kid starts to recognize his mom explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.780" end="01:16:08.760" style="s2">&#39;cause he or she knows the smell right away, pretty much, and the sound of the voice, but visually</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.760" end="01:16:15.300" style="s2">if someone comes in and it isn&#39;t who the baby wants, so generally it isn&#39;t mom</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.300" end="01:16:21.760" style="s2">the baby will start to cry, but it&#39;s not &#39;cause the baby&#39;s sad, generally, it&#39;s because it&#39;s angry that mom didn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.760" end="01:16:26.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s an early sign of will, it&#39;s like this kid wants things</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.180" end="01:16:29.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s perfectly willing to tell you about</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.800" end="01:16:34.260" style="s2">and of course a two-year-old who&#39;s having a temper tantrum is in some sense doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.260" end="01:16:40.220" style="s2">it&#39;s poorly integrated will and independence, obviously, but it certainly runs contrary to what you want</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.220" end="01:16:43.860" style="s2">you don&#39;t want your two-year-old having a temper tantrum in the middle of the toy store</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.860" end="01:16:50.160" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinarily embarrassing for you and... well, for you, but it&#39;s also embarrassing for the two-year-old</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.160" end="01:16:56.040" style="s2">this is one of the reasons I think that that sort of thing should be carefully socialized rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.040" end="01:16:59.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually humiliating for the kid, &#39;cause other people don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.880" end="01:17:04.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re very judgmental about it, they won&#39;t say anything, usually, but sometimes they will</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.440" end="01:17:09.360" style="s2">but they&#39;re not happy about the fact that that&#39;s happening, and they will judge the child negatively</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.360" end="01:17:16.300" style="s2">so you don&#39;t want your child to be behaving in a way in public that makes other people think badly of them</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.300" end="01:17:25.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really, really not good, and so part of your job as a parent is to not expose your child to that sort of experience</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.760" end="01:17:29.280" style="s2">especially not repeatedly, it&#39;s really hard on them</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.280" end="01:17:32.820" style="s2">or they get narcissistic, which is also rally hard on them</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.820" end="01:17:35.420" style="s2">it just takes a lot longer to manifest itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.420" end="01:17:41.680" style="s2">so anyways, he&#39;s off on stage and Stromboli introduces him and talks about how wonderful this is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.680" end="01:17:45.600" style="s2">and Pinokio comes out on stage with the strings on, and drops them</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.600" end="01:17:49.140" style="s2">and then he falls down the steps and puts his nose into a hole, makes a fool out of himself</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.140" end="01:17:56.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s the first time Stromboli shows his true character, &#39;cause he just really yells and screams at him</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.960" end="01:18:03.260" style="s2">and he has his back to the audience, Stromboli, while he&#39;s doing this, so he&#39;s not noticing how the audience is reacting</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.260" end="01:18:09.860" style="s2">typical tyrannical parent, right, who&#39;s not noticing that society is reacting a different way than him</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.860" end="01:18:15.320" style="s2">he&#39;s not happy about it, and Pinokio of course is dazed and feels like a fool, and he is a fool</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.320" end="01:18:23.300" style="s2">so that&#39;s appropriate; but then Stromboli hears the crowd laughing, and as soon as he turns around he&#39;s all smiles again</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.300" end="01:18:27.780" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first time you get insight into what sort of puppet master he is</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.780" end="01:18:33.020" style="s2">he&#39;s there to please the crowd and that&#39;s all, and he&#39;s there to look good in public, but fundamentally he&#39;s a tyrant</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.020" end="01:18:41.000" style="s2">and I guess that&#39;s the problem with false celebrity, that the negative spirit of the crowd becomes your master</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.000" end="01:18:47.900" style="s2">because to be a celebrity, you have to be a crowd pleaser, and if you&#39;re pleasing the kind of crowd who likes a celebrity like you</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.900" end="01:18:56.620" style="s2">which is... and there&#39;s not much reason for that, then it&#39;s not exactly like you&#39;re appealing to the proper side of the crowd</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.620" end="01:19:01.580" style="s2">and you&#39;ve become its puppet one way or another, and maybe it&#39;s rewarding you with wealth, perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.580" end="01:19:08.940" style="s2">and with attention, but fundamentally it&#39;s not something I would recommend</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.940" end="01:19:15.020" style="s2">if you want to stay reasonably psychologically healthy for any reasonable amount of time; you&#39;re gonna sell yourself out</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.020" end="01:19:19.580" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean that in any casual way, you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.580" end="01:19:25.520" style="s2">all right, so anyways, Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the good father in half a second</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.520" end="01:19:30.220" style="s2">he gives Pinokio a pat on the head despite the fact that he&#39;s made a mistake, looks all kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.220" end="01:19:34.640" style="s2">and the show continues; now, the cricket is not very happy about this</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.640" end="01:19:40.920" style="s2">he&#39;s sitting in the stage, watching, he&#39;s very  angry and, let&#39;s say, disgusted by what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.920" end="01:19:45.960" style="s2">partly because Pinokio is making a fool of himself; now that&#39;s an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.960" end="01:19:54.340" style="s2">human beings blush, in fact, if I remember correctly, the name Adam, you know, like Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.340" end="01:20:00.600" style="s2">is related to the capacity to blush; now that comes from something I read a long time ago, and that might be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.600" end="01:20:06.420" style="s2">but Adam does manifest shame in the sight of God, so there is a relationship there</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.420" end="01:20:12.240" style="s2">but anyways, people do make foold of themselves for public display</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.240" end="01:20:16.440" style="s2">and you can tell you&#39;ve done that in some sense, not always, if you blush</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.440" end="01:20:21.760" style="s2">because you&#39;ve either said something you shoulnd&#39;t&#39;ve and you realize that</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.760" end="01:20:27.200" style="s2">which is more like you&#39;ve tried to be funny and gone a little bit too far, and sometimes that can be really funny</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.200" end="01:20:34.580" style="s2">or you&#39;ve said something you know to be false, manipulative, deceitful, beneath you</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.580" end="01:20:39.580" style="s2">any of those things, and you&#39;ll have an automatic response to it, you&#39;ll be ashamed and blush</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.580" end="01:20:46.880" style="s2">one theory about that is you can trust people who blush, because you know that their conscience will betray them</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.880" end="01:20:51.640" style="s2">and so that even if they are lying, they tell you; it&#39;s an interesting theory</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.640" end="01:20:57.580" style="s2">because blush is definitely... like it&#39;s a facial display, it&#39;s right out there, where people can see it</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.580" end="01:21:02.080" style="s2">you know, maybe that&#39;s true, maybe it isn&#39;t, but it&#39;s kind of an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.080" end="01:21:05.800" style="s2">anyways, the cricket is not happy with what&#39;s going on, he&#39;s not happy about Stromboli</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.800" end="01:21:12.680" style="s2">and he&#39;s not happy about the willingness of Pinokio to make a fool of himself to support this false celebrity</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.680" end="01:21:20.960" style="s2">I actually think that&#39;s why celebrity types like that often get narcissistic and arrogant</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.960" end="01:21:29.840" style="s2">it&#39;s because they aren&#39;t paying attention really to what&#39;s happening inside them, they drown it out</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.840" end="01:21:35.360" style="s2">because the glory and the money, and all that is so attractive and enticing</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.360" end="01:21:38.940" style="s2">they refuse to notice what price they&#39;re paying for it</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.940" end="01:21:43.900" style="s2">and they magnify up their grandiosity and their arrogance to keep that stuff all under control</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.900" end="01:21:47.620" style="s2">and then of course they get surrounded by sycophants, which is a really bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.620" end="01:21:52.520" style="s2">they get surrounded by people who will tell them exactly what they wanna hear</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.520" end="01:21:56.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s really bad if what you wanna hear from other people is not good for you</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.440" end="01:22:04.100" style="s2">to surround yourself with people who won&#39;t offer you genuine criticism, or even genuine reward, it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.100" end="01:22:11.720" style="s2">you want from me that I differentially reward and punish you in approximately the way that the good part of the crowd will</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.720" end="01:22:14.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what you want from all your friends</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.120" end="01:22:19.780" style="s2">because then your interactions with them can generalize out to the broader community in a productive way</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.780" end="01:22:25.620" style="s2">and so a good friend... your friends tend to be on the supportive side, and perhaps that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.620" end="01:22:30.980" style="s2">assuming there&#39;s reciprocity; but a good friend will also tell you when one way or another</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.980" end="01:22:35.460" style="s2">when your behavior is starting to tilt in a direction that&#39;s going to make you unpopular with them</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.460" end="01:22:42.440" style="s2">and likely unpopular with other people; and that&#39;s the prime job of a parent, in my estimation</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.440" end="01:22:48.360" style="s2">like: &quot;don&#39;t do that, other people will hurt you if you do that</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.360" end="01:22:55.320" style="s2">by exclusion, by threat, by failure to offer you an opportunity, bad things will happen to you&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.320" end="01:23:00.780" style="s2">so you can&#39;t do that; and then you&#39;re a representative of the social situation</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.780" end="01:23:05.040" style="s2">which is exactly what you should be, not a friend</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.040" end="01:23:12.200" style="s2">or at least not precisely a friend, that doesn&#39;t make you an enemy, it makes you better than a friend</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.200" end="01:23:19.520" style="s2">so Pinokio&#39;s on stage making a fool out of himself, and then he gets all tangled up in other puppets&#39; strings</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.520" end="01:23:26.460" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens to him, and then it all ends rather badly with everything being a tangled mess on stage</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.460" end="01:23:32.340" style="s2">but it also turns out to be rather funny; it&#39;s funny, &#39;cause he&#39;s surrounded by angry Russians</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.340" end="01:23:39.820" style="s2">you could kind of view that as a potential lesson, that if you&#39;re a puppet on a stage, and you mess around too much</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.820" end="01:23:45.600" style="s2">you just might get tangled up with a bunch of angry Russians, these are Cossacks, that&#39;s exactly what happens</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.600" end="01:23:51.220" style="s2">of course, no, that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening here, but it&#39;s still funny</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.220" end="01:23:58.900" style="s2">so Stromboli is not happy with the tangled mess, but then the crowd reacts very positively</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.900" end="01:24:05.660" style="s2">and that confuses the conscience, because he thinks: &quot;well, look, this is horrible, this guy&#39;s a tyrant, Pinokio&#39;s making a fool of himself</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.660" end="01:24:09.580" style="s2">everything turns into a tangled mess, but the crowd goes crazy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.580" end="01:24:14.140" style="s2">being a fool, that can be entertaining, right?</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.140" end="01:24:20.220" style="s2">so it&#39;s hard to tell when a crowd, especially at a spectacle, &#39;cause this crowd is at a spectacle</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.220" end="01:24:26.480" style="s2">you just don&#39;t know exactly why it is that they&#39;re responding positively, but you&#39;ve definitely given them what they want</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.480" end="01:24:34.060" style="s2">you can see this look on Stromboli&#39;s face, it&#39;s like this false false kindness and generosity, public facing</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.060" end="01:24:40.060" style="s2">anyways, the conscience is very confused, and I really think this is an important thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.060" end="01:24:43.600" style="s2">&#39;cause I&#39;ve often thought... I spent a lot of time thinking about Hitler, and I was thinking:</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.600" end="01:24:52.680" style="s2">how do you get into a state like that? and you think: he&#39;s a dictator, and he led his people down a bad path</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.680" end="01:25:00.500" style="s2">that&#39;s not right, that is not what happened; they had a conspiracy together, and went down a bad path</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.500" end="01:25:08.220" style="s2">think about it this way: if one person thinks something about you, it&#39;s like whatever, right?</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.220" end="01:25:16.640" style="s2">but if 5 people tell you that, then to start not taking that seriously is kind of narcissistic</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.640" end="01:25:22.040" style="s2">and if it isn&#39;t 5, let&#39;s say it&#39;s 15 people tell you the same thing or act the same way towards you</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.040" end="01:25:28.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like probably you should clue in; well, what if you&#39;re a politician</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.160" end="01:25:33.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying out a bunch of different ideas, and you&#39;re good at interacting with a crowd</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.200" end="01:25:38.200" style="s2">you&#39;re charismatic, you watch the crowd, but you&#39;re not necessarily all that articulate</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.200" end="01:25:41.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t have your values all straightened out, but you&#39;re kinda angry, too</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.280" end="01:25:47.480" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s &#39;cause you spent a bunch of time in World War I in the trenches, which was like no joke</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.480" end="01:25:51.340" style="s2">and all your friends got blown up; and then you were unemployed</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.340" end="01:25:54.880" style="s2">and then you tried to be an artist, and that didn&#39;t work out, even though you were moderately talented</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.880" end="01:25:59.500" style="s2">and then maybe the economy fell apart completely on you, hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.500" end="01:26:04.660" style="s2">and then maybe there was a communist menace coming in from the east, and there genuinely was</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.660" end="01:26:11.100" style="s2">so you&#39;re not the world&#39;s happiest clam at that point,  and you&#39;re talking to people who aren&#39;t that happy either</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.100" end="01:26:16.680" style="s2">&#39;cause they were also badly defeated in World War I, and they had a terrible treaty they had to sign, and they lost part of their territory</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.680" end="01:26:23.380" style="s2">and so the crowd&#39;s not happy, and neither are you, and there&#39;s reason for it; and so you start talking to them</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.380" end="01:26:26.500" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re upset about, and neither does the crowd</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.500" end="01:26:31.900" style="s2">so you start to articulate some things about why you might be upset, and some of them fall flat</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.900" end="01:26:35.480" style="s2">but you&#39;re paying attention to the crowd, so you stop saying those things</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.480" end="01:26:42.380" style="s2">and some of the things make the crowd really wake up and listen, and so you start saying more of those things</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.380" end="01:26:48.060" style="s2">it&#39;s an unconscious dialectic between you and the crowd; it&#39;s mediated by consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.060" end="01:26:53.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s not like you&#39;re sitting there, saying, although you might be: &quot;I&#39;m gonna tell this crowd more of what it wants to hear&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.340" end="01:27:01.040" style="s2">it&#39;s more sophisticated than that; and so you do that a thousand times, and you do that to ever-increasing crowds</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.040" end="01:27:07.400" style="s2">and the crowd really starts to go mad, and they basically tell you that you&#39;re the savior of the nation</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.400" end="01:27:13.380" style="s2">how many bloody people have to tell you that before you start to believe it?</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.380" end="01:27:18.360" style="s2">I would say, with a typical person, a hundred would do it</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.360" end="01:27:25.000" style="s2">that&#39;ll get you going, man, if a hundred people tell you specifically why you&#39;re special, you&#39;re gonna be thinkin&#39;...</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.000" end="01:27:29.800" style="s2">even if you&#39;re humble to begin with, you&#39;re gonna be thinking: &quot;geez, there&#39;s gotta be something to this, man&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.800" end="01:27:34.840" style="s2">but if it&#39;s a million people, and they&#39;re roaring their approval, well...</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.840" end="01:27:38.520" style="s2">and then when it&#39;s a whole nation, good luck withstanding that</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.520" end="01:27:43.100" style="s2">there&#39;s just not a chance, how are you going to withstand that?</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.100" end="01:27:49.120" style="s2">now, you could be like Ghandi, and you could&#39;ve taken that into account beforehand, because he did</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.120" end="01:27:53.980" style="s2">he read Tolstoy, by the way, he was a student of Tolstoy, and that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.980" end="01:28:01.740" style="s2">because Tolstoy developed the techniques of non-violence that Ghandi used; and Tolstoy was also a deeply religious writer</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.740" end="01:28:09.060" style="s2">apart from his novels, which are not, I wouldn&#39;t say, really in the religious category, although they&#39;re profound</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.060" end="01:28:18.980" style="s2">Tolstoy stressed humility with non-violence, he really stressed it, and that&#39;s what Ghandi took to heart</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.980" end="01:28:23.760" style="s2">so he lived a very, very, very simple, bare-bones, ascetic life</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.760" end="01:28:30.440" style="s2">and that was to kinda see if he could keep his damn ego tapped down while the groundswell was building behind him</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.440" end="01:28:34.600" style="s2">you know, and he dressed really simply, and he didn&#39;t own much, and he ate very simply</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.600" end="01:28:38.640" style="s2">and he just tried to stay away from the whole materialistic success element</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.640" end="01:28:42.460" style="s2">that would be an element of what would turn him into an actor, and also inflate his ego</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.460" end="01:28:47.300" style="s2">he seemed to do that pretty well, he certainly...</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.300" end="01:28:52.600" style="s2">well, he led a non-violent revolution that resulted in the independence of India</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.600" end="01:28:58.340" style="s2">it also produced a terrible civil war in the separation of the Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.340" end="01:29:03.700" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think you can precisely lay that at the feet of Ghandi</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.700" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">but what I&#39;m saying is that you have to be an extraordinary person, you have to be extraordinarily wise</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:14.040" style="s2">and you have to take ridiculous precautions if you&#39;re gonna put yourself in the public sphere like that</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.040" end="01:29:19.240" style="s2">and expose yourself to that kind of adulation without becoming a puppet of the crowd</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.240" end="01:29:23.980" style="s2">and that&#39;s what happened to Hitler; I mean it&#39;s not like he wasn&#39;t also a conscious manipulator</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.980" end="01:29:27.940" style="s2">and surrounded himself by people who were propagandists, and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.940" end="01:29:34.140" style="s2">so there was a conscious element, but... you gotta think these things through, and see how that dialectic develops</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.140" end="01:29:40.080" style="s2">he learned how to appeal to the darkest fantasies of the crowd, he was really, really good at it</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.080" end="01:29:44.600" style="s2">and that was a dialectic process, right, the crowd told him what they wanted to hear...</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.600" end="01:29:49.500" style="s2">and the crowd&#39;s a mob at that point, so I don&#39;t have to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.500" end="01:29:54.240" style="s2">for the fact that I&#39;m screaming my approval when I&#39;m surrounded  by a million people</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.240" end="01:30:01.380" style="s2">so I can scream my approval for whatever I want, for whatever dark, revengeful fantasy might be playing out in my imagination</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.380" end="01:30:06.820" style="s2">because I&#39;m not gonna be held accountable for it</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.820" end="01:30:12.280" style="s2">anyways, the cricket&#39;s confused, and it&#39;s no wonder, it&#39;s like the public has rendered its judgment</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.280" end="01:30:19.460" style="s2">and the judgment is positive; so when I wrote the book on which this course is based</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.460" end="01:30:26.880" style="s2">I was thinking: &quot;how am I gonna judge success?&quot; and I thought: &quot;well, there&#39;s sort of four... there&#39;s a two by two matrix of success&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.880" end="01:30:33.180" style="s2">you could say: it&#39;s a great book, no one reads it; that happens, what do you do about that?</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.180" end="01:30:39.220" style="s2">Nietzsche sold virtually nothing in his life time, and you know that&#39;s happened to lots of artists</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.220" end="01:30:43.620" style="s2">then: it&#39;s a terrible book, and everyone loves it; that happens too</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.620" end="01:30:47.780" style="s2">and then: it&#39;s a great book, and everyone loves it; and then: it&#39;s a terrible book, and everyone hates it</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.780" end="01:30:53.100" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a better category, actually, than &quot;it&#39;s a terrible book and everyone loves it&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.100" end="01:30:57.440" style="s2">I mean, you wouldn&#39;t pick &quot;a terrible book that everyone hates&quot; if you had a choice</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.440" end="01:31:04.620" style="s2">but at least the quality and the response match, at least it&#39;s truthful, like: &quot;great book, good response&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.620" end="01:31:11.100" style="s2">but the problem with those four categories is you can&#39;t really tell which category your production falls into</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.100" end="01:31:14.300" style="s2">because how do you know?</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.300" end="01:31:18.740" style="s2">I think you should assume &quot;horrible book, bad response,&quot; because that&#39;s the most likely</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.740" end="01:31:26.180" style="s2">of all four of those categories, that&#39;s the most likely to be true, purely on actuarial grounds, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.180" end="01:31:31.100" style="s2">so, all right, so anyways, the cricket wanders away, because he obviously...</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.100" end="01:31:35.000" style="s2">not only was he late for work that day, but he turned out to be wrong about everything</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.000" end="01:31:44.280" style="s2">so he lets Pinokio go off on his adventure; and Stromboli puts him in this little touring wagon</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.280" end="01:31:54.360" style="s2">and away they go; and the cricket thinks: &quot;well, the consciensce isn&#39;t needed anymore on this journey towards unearned celebrity&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.360" end="01:32:04.860" style="s2">well, meanwhile, back at the ranch, as they say, the puppet is supposed to come home after school</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.860" end="01:32:12.260" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t, he doesn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.260" end="01:32:20.080" style="s2">and the kitten, and the fish, and Gepetto are all waiting there for him, ready to eat</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.080" end="01:32:26.860" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.860" end="01:32:32.840" style="s2">and so Gepetto goes out into the rain to look for him</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.840" end="01:32:40.880" style="s2">and he can&#39;t find him; and then we see the inside of the traveling show cart</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.880" end="01:32:47.840" style="s2">and Stromboli is having a snack, and counting all the money that he&#39;s made from tonight&#39;s performance</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.840" end="01:32:54.380" style="s2">and hypothetically dividing it out with the puppet, so we&#39;ve got this little stack of gold, and some of it&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.380" end="01:32:59.680" style="s2">somebody paid with a... looks like a little washer, mechanical washer, and it&#39;s bent</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.680" end="01:33:05.960" style="s2">and so he curses about that for a while, even though, it&#39;s interesting, eh, because he&#39;s made all this money</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.960" end="01:33:13.940" style="s2">he&#39;s been really successful, but this one little error is enough to enrage him, which is very ungrateful and tyrannical</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.940" end="01:33:21.620" style="s2">look, you got a hundred gold pieces, someone&#39;s slipped you a fake one</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.620" end="01:33:25.420" style="s2">you could&#39;ve had 101, it&#39;s still a pretty good day, all things considered</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.420" end="01:33:29.720" style="s2">you know, you gotta make a bit of allowance for error, which is something a tyrant does not do</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.720" end="01:33:38.420" style="s2">and that&#39;s perfect, because if you don&#39;t make allowance for error at all, then people are always guilty of something</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.420" end="01:33:44.380" style="s2">and if you&#39;re a tyrant, that&#39;s exactly what you want; and people *are* always guilty of something</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.380" end="01:33:49.400" style="s2">so the tyrant who is willing to exploit that is always on solid ground</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.400" end="01:33:56.220" style="s2">anyways, he doesn&#39;t share with Pinokio</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.220" end="01:34:02.040" style="s2">and he puts him in a bird cage, a jail, and he also shows him this other puppet that has an axe through him</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.040" end="01:34:08.520" style="s2">that was the previous puppet, who didn&#39;t precisely perform as he was supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.520" end="01:34:14.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s a big threat there, it&#39;s like: &quot;you stay in that jail, you do exactly what I want</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.440" end="01:34:19.520" style="s2">or it&#39;s off to the wood pile for you, to be burned&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.520" end="01:34:26.420" style="s2">well, that&#39;s just worth thinking about, &#39;cause that&#39;s kind of what happens with tyrants</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.420" end="01:34:31.240" style="s2">and literally, not just metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.240" end="01:34:40.040" style="s2">so the cricket is basically wondering what in the world he should do</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.040" end="01:34:44.740" style="s2">and then the cart rolls by, and he gets an inking or hears, I don&#39;t quite remember this</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.740" end="01:34:50.260" style="s2">that Pinokio is in there, and might be in trouble, or he thinks that up, I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t remember that</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.260" end="01:34:54.980" style="s2">but he ends up inside the cart, he finds that traveling cart, and he goes inside</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.980" end="01:34:59.360" style="s2">and then he tries to pick the lock, &#39;cause he&#39;s a bug, he can climb inside</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.360" end="01:35:05.020" style="s2">he tries to pick the lock, he tries to get Pinokio out of the jail that he sort of collaborated himself into</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.020" end="01:35:12.040" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting, because if you read, for example, if you read Solzhenitsyn&#39;s Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.040" end="01:35:22.660" style="s2">which I would highly recommend, one of the things you find is that if you were arrested by the  KGB</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.660" end="01:35:33.980" style="s2">the secret police in the Soviet Union, and you were hauled off to a... like a tribunal, before a judge</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.980" end="01:35:41.360" style="s2">they wanted you to admit that you were guilty, you had to, they&#39;d torture you until you confessed</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.360" end="01:35:46.360" style="s2">or you could just confess, and I always found that so mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.360" end="01:35:52.300" style="s2">they kick down your door, they know perfectly well that they haven&#39;t got anymore on you than they&#39;ve got on anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.300" end="01:35:57.260" style="s2">and yet you have to go through the damn trial, and you have to admit that they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.260" end="01:36:02.740" style="s2">why do they even bother with that? why don&#39;t they just throw your sorry ass into the camp?</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.740" end="01:36:07.540" style="s2">which is essentially what&#39;s gonna happen anyway; why do they need your collaboration?</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.540" end="01:36:17.480" style="s2">you know, I never quite figured that out, I think it&#39;s partly because they&#39;re not willing to let you stand in opposition to the rules</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.480" end="01:36:24.900" style="s2">because the mere fact that you&#39;ll do that means that you exist as something that is allowed to exist outside the rules</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.900" end="01:36:30.240" style="s2">and they&#39;re not having any of that, so that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.240" end="01:36:36.020" style="s2">but there&#39;s more to it, there&#39;s more to it than that, it&#39;s like the drama of collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.020" end="01:36:41.280" style="s2">one of the things I learned about societies like the Soviet Union, and this is true of all tyrannical societies</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.280" end="01:36:47.580" style="s2">is that the idea that that&#39;s top-down, and that people are just following orders, they&#39;re good people, but they&#39;re just following orders</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.580" end="01:36:50.500" style="s2">you can forget about that, that&#39;s a stupid theory</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.500" end="01:36:56.320" style="s2">when a society becomes tyrannical like that, the tyranny exists at every single level of the society</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.320" end="01:37:03.200" style="s2">you tyrannize your own conscience; so let&#39;s say you&#39;re a true believer in Marxist utopia, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.200" end="01:37:09.340" style="s2">or a national socialist Third Reich, that&#39;s gonna last a thousand years and be racially pure, and you really believe that</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.340" end="01:37:14.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s supposed to be a perfect state, and that&#39;s already been delivered to you</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.320" end="01:37:20.060" style="s2">so what that means is that insofar as you&#39;re a true believer, your own suffering becomes heretical</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.060" end="01:37:26.260" style="s2">because to the degree that you&#39;re suffering, you&#39;re living proof of the fact that the system is not delivering what it promised to deliver</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.260" end="01:37:31.800" style="s2">and so you have to suppress that, you have to become your own tyrant, you can&#39;t admit that anything&#39;s gone wrong</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.800" end="01:37:36.740" style="s2">and of course you can&#39;t talk about it to your family, because one out of three of them are government informers</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.740" end="01:37:41.000" style="s2">just like one out of three of everyone, and you&#39;re certainly not going to mention it in the workplace</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.000" end="01:37:45.080" style="s2">because unless you&#39;re a devout communist party member, you&#39;re not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.080" end="01:37:51.280" style="s2">and if any of your ancestors were land owners or bourgeoisie, you&#39;re done, you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.280" end="01:37:54.220" style="s2">class guilt, man, you&#39;re not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.220" end="01:38:00.240" style="s2">and then every single level of the bureaucracy is exactly the same as that, and on the top there&#39;s a tyrant</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.240" end="01:38:04.920" style="s2">but the tyrant is everywhere, everywhere from the peak to the soul</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.920" end="01:38:10.580" style="s2">it&#39;s all tyranny, and everyone participates in that by lying about everything</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.580" end="01:38:14.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you see what happens next in the movie</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.020" end="01:38:20.580" style="s2">Pinokio&#39;s in jail, and he&#39;s there because he was naive, and he allowed himself to be enticed</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.580" end="01:38:26.320" style="s2">and because he did something that would&#39;ve run contrary to his conscience; but the movie does not put up straw men</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.320" end="01:38:32.640" style="s2">the poor damn puppet got tangled into this, his conscience wasn&#39;t even around, so you have to have some sympathy for him</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.640" end="01:38:35.520" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t matter, it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.520" end="01:38:44.820" style="s2">because he ends up in jail and he can&#39;t get out, and the fact that in some ways it wasn&#39;t his fault</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.820" end="01:38:48.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change the fact that he&#39;s in jail, and he can&#39;t get out</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.600" end="01:38:51.180" style="s2">and then his...</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.180" end="01:38:56.620" style="s2">I was watching Louis CK the other night, and he was talking about children lying</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.620" end="01:39:02.480" style="s2">he was talking about his 9-year-old daughter lying, and he said: &quot;it&#39;s no wonder children lie</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.480" end="01:39:07.680" style="s2">no wonder it&#39;s impossible for you to stop them</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.680" end="01:39:13.720" style="s2">because you&#39;re talking to someone whose head would scrape the roof, they weigh three times as much as you</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.720" end="01:39:19.800" style="s2">and they&#39;re capable of force, and they&#39;re intimidating; and they say to you something like:</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.800" end="01:39:23.660" style="s2">&quot;did you take that last cookie after I told you not to?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.660" end="01:39:28.600" style="s2">and you&#39;re thinking: &quot;oh no, I took the cookie, what am I gonna do?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.600" end="01:39:35.140" style="s2">and then you get a genius idea in your head; smarter children learn to lie earlier</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.140" end="01:39:39.280" style="s2">children with high IQs learn to lie younger; and CK says:</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.280" end="01:39:43.540" style="s2">&quot;well, it&#39;s like you&#39;ve just been handed a magic get out of jail free card</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.540" end="01:39:50.460" style="s2">you can just say: &quot;no, I didn&#39;t take that cookie&quot;; and worse than that, it works in every single situation</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.460" end="01:39:55.320" style="s2">if you get away with it; and now you&#39;re supposed to learn not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.320" end="01:40:04.220" style="s2">well, great, that&#39;s the thing about comedians, they tell you the underlying truth, which is why people think they&#39;re so funny</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.220" end="01:40:09.340" style="s2">like the jester at the king&#39;s court, he&#39;s the only one who&#39;s allowed to tell the king the truth, &#39;cause he&#39;s beneath contempt</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.340" end="01:40:12.620" style="s2">that&#39;s what comedians do</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.620" end="01:40:17.180" style="s2">so what happens is Pinokio is not very happy about this, it&#39;s really breaking him up</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.180" end="01:40:21.220" style="s2">and the blue fairy appears again from the star, same way</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.220" end="01:40:30.000" style="s2">so what this means is, and I think this is right, this is something Jung talked about, it&#39;s also extraordinarily brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.000" end="01:40:36.040" style="s2">he said that it&#39;s one thing to break a rule when you don&#39;t really know the rule</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.040" end="01:40:41.540" style="s2">for whatever reason you seem to get a bit of a free pass for that</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.540" end="01:40:47.920" style="s2">but if then you know the rule, and then you break it anyway, you get hit a lot harder</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.920" end="01:40:53.780" style="s2">and I know that&#39;s true, and I even think I figured out why it was true at one point, but I can&#39;t remember at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.780" end="01:41:03.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about... it&#39;s like the severity of the moral error isn&#39;t quite as massive if you&#39;re genuinely ingorant and unconscious about the rule</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.520" end="01:41:09.240" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re not violating your own belief system as much when you engage in the misactivity</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.240" end="01:41:13.420" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.420" end="01:41:18.440" style="s2">so Pinokio is in there, and he&#39;s partly at fault, at least because he&#39;s naive</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.440" end="01:41:25.600" style="s2">and he&#39;s very desperate about it; but it&#39;s also because his conscience isn&#39;t functioning very well</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.600" end="01:41:31.520" style="s2">so he has his reasons, and so whatever, the blue fairy shows up again, mother nature steps in</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.520" end="01:41:39.500" style="s2">to aid him; and that is true, I would say, it&#39;s not like you get walloped</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.500" end="01:41:45.520" style="s2">or killed every time you make a mistake, which is kinda interesting</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.520" end="01:41:50.140" style="s2">and especially that&#39;s the case with kids, we have more leeway for them</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.140" end="01:41:55.520" style="s2">whether nature does, that&#39;s a different issue, but I would say yes, because kids are really cute</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.520" end="01:42:01.300" style="s2">and they&#39;re appealing, and they&#39;re naive, and they&#39;re kind of helpless, they have those motions even</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.300" end="01:42:06.120" style="s2">that indicate helplessness, and that&#39;s associated with a natural apprehension of cuteness</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.120" end="01:42:11.740" style="s2">cuteness is basically: big eyes, small nose, symmetrical features, baby-like features</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.740" end="01:42:18.940" style="s2">helpless movements; that elicits sympathy and compassion, and it does it cross-species</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.940" end="01:42:27.720" style="s2">and so does the cry; my roommate when I was in college had a niece who was quite young, about a year and a half old, I think</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.720" end="01:42:35.700" style="s2">and we had a cat, a wild cat, it was a really fighty cat, partly because of me, because I would always play with it</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.700" end="01:42:40.700" style="s2">and I let it fight with me quite a lot, so it was a fighty cat</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.700" end="01:42:47.180" style="s2">that little girl would come over, and you know, maybe she&#39;d cry, and that cat was there right now, trying to figure out what was wrong</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.180" end="01:42:52.440" style="s2">the cat would use its claws on me, but it would never use its claws on the little kid</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.440" end="01:42:57.480" style="s2">and I thought, that&#39;s an indication of that cross-species cuteness</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.480" end="01:43:03.640" style="s2">you&#39;re all attracted to that, more or less, and the more maternal you are, the more you&#39;re attracted to such things</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.640" end="01:43:08.140" style="s2">but you know, you see something on YouTube, and you go &quot;aww&quot;, and &quot;that&#39;s so cute&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.140" end="01:43:19.220" style="s2">yeah, it is, it appeals to exactly this concomitation [sic][possibly meant combination] of infantile features</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.220" end="01:43:26.580" style="s2">and it brings out compassion unless you&#39;re psychopathic, so it&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.580" end="01:43:32.380" style="s2">but it can be manipulated, that&#39;s for sure, women actually manipulate it with makeup</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.380" end="01:43:38.080" style="s2">which is quite sneaky, and good of them</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.080" end="01:43:45.300" style="s2">anyways, the Blue Fairy shows up, so that&#39;s nature, so what I&#39;m saying is nature will cut kids a break</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.300" end="01:43:51.340" style="s2">if you think of nature in the guise of their mother, for example, but even the biology of other people</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.340" end="01:43:56.520" style="s2">&#39;cause we&#39;re wired to accept behavior from children that we wouldn&#39;t accept from other people</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.520" end="01:44:03.340" style="s2">so nature will forgive; so she shows up in her heavenly guise, and says:</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.340" end="01:44:09.880" style="s2">&quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; and Pinokio, again because he&#39;s naive, but also because he&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.880" end="01:44:15.020" style="s2">he&#39;s not evil either, he&#39;s neither or both, depends on how you look at it</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.020" end="01:44:20.900" style="s2">he also has no idea how smart he is, and how smart he isn&#39;t, or how smart the person he&#39;s talking to is</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.900" end="01:44:26.940" style="s2">and instead of admitting what he&#39;s done, he lies about it, and that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.940" end="01:44:34.000" style="s2">because it does suggest that he understands at some level that he set himself up for this</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.000" end="01:44:43.800" style="s2">because he could have just told the truth, &quot;this horrible fox kidnapped me, and sold me to this slave holder&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.800" end="01:44:49.800" style="s2">which is true, it&#39;s a lot more true than the story he tells, he tells a story about some monster</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.800" end="01:44:56.140" style="s2">a fictional monster; he could have told even three quarters of the truth and had it work, but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.140" end="01:45:01.120" style="s2">he just obscures the story entirely; and this is the part of the movie that people remember</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.120" end="01:45:07.840" style="s2">and I edited this out for years when I was talking about this movie, I forgot why it was so significant</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.840" end="01:45:13.980" style="s2">his nose grows, and it grows to ridiculous length</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.980" end="01:45:19.500" style="s2">and why is that?</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.500" end="01:45:24.200" style="s2">I think it was Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens, who said:</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.200" end="01:45:28.640" style="s2">&quot;one of the advantages to telling the truth is that you don&#39;t have to remember what you said&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.640" end="01:45:34.060" style="s2">and that, God, that&#39;s worth listening to, because...</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.060" end="01:45:38.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things that I learned as a clinician</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.720" end="01:45:43.260" style="s2">and one of them is... &#39;cause you&#39;re often in really weird situations if you&#39;re a clinician</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.260" end="01:45:47.080" style="s2">&#39;cause things happen that don&#39;t happen normally, and you don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.080" end="01:45:51.300" style="s2">so what I&#39;ve learned is I just say what&#39;s happening, whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.300" end="01:45:55.800" style="s2">regardless of what it is, I&#39;ll just try to describe it as accurately as I can</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.800" end="01:45:59.180" style="s2">and don&#39;t worry in some sense about the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.180" end="01:46:02.660" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to go out of my way to cause trouble, but if you&#39;re in a really...</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.660" end="01:46:07.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m telling you, this could save your life at times, especially if you&#39;re dealing with someone&#39;s who&#39;s paranoid</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.580" end="01:46:11.880" style="s2">who&#39;s really paranoid; you do not lie to someone who&#39;s paranoid and violent</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.880" end="01:46:16.560" style="s2">because as soon as you lie you&#39;re aligned with the forces that are persecuting him</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.560" end="01:46:20.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna be watching, because paranoia makes people hyper-vigilant, like they&#39;re on amphetamines</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.880" end="01:46:24.760" style="s2">in fact, you can make people paranoid by giving them enough amphetamines</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.760" end="01:46:28.800" style="s2">and you can make paranoid people more paranoid by giving them amphetamines</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.800" end="01:46:33.420" style="s2">so they&#39;re hyper-vigilant, because they feel that everything is predatory, and against them</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.420" end="01:46:38.400" style="s2">and so they&#39;re watching you like you would not believe, way more than you&#39;re watching them</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.400" end="01:46:43.520" style="s2">and if you flicker a lie while you&#39;re talking to them, and they&#39;re really on the edge</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.520" end="01:46:49.740" style="s2">you&#39;re done; so it&#39;s one thing to know if you&#39;re ever in a really bad situation</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.740" end="01:46:56.960" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know what to do: you tell the truth, minimally, don&#39;t disclose too much, that&#39;s just another lie</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.960" end="01:47:01.940" style="s2">you tell the truth minimally and carefully, and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.940" end="01:47:05.680" style="s2">and you might get out of it, you might get out of it</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.680" end="01:47:10.300" style="s2">but if you falsify it, look the hell out</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.300" end="01:47:16.840" style="s2">so the truth is a real mechanism of protection in dangerous situations</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.840" end="01:47:21.780" style="s2">if someone&#39;s trying to intimidate you, and you think they might be violent, and they ask you if you&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.780" end="01:47:27.540" style="s2">then you tell them that you&#39;re terrified and that you hope things will go okay</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.540" end="01:47:31.960" style="s2">or you say... I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.960" end="01:47:41.660" style="s2">one time I was in an airport, and we&#39;re in this lineup to fly back to Canada that said &quot;international flights&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.660" end="01:47:48.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a long lineup, like 50 people, I got about 3 [people] from the front, there&#39;s still like 40 people behind me</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.440" end="01:47:52.280" style="s2">and the guy behind the counter decided that he was just gonna shut down the line</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.280" end="01:47:58.680" style="s2">and we could all go to this other line, which was like 300 people long, and I suggested that he not do that</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.680" end="01:48:04.020" style="s2">because we&#39;d been standing there for half and hour, and that he could just deal with the 20 of us that were left</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.020" end="01:48:07.940" style="s2">and have a clue; and he called the sheriff, right away</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.940" end="01:48:12.340" style="s2">and this was down in Florida, and it wasn&#39;t that long after 9/11</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.340" end="01:48:17.320" style="s2">and so these guys came up, and they were armed, and they came, and looked at me</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.320" end="01:48:22.900" style="s2">because of course he told them that I was causing trouble, which I wasn&#39;t, I was just trying to not...</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.900" end="01:48:30.500" style="s2">let, what would you say, an arrogant bureaucratic scumrat [sic] take advantage of me</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.500" end="01:48:36.120" style="s2">which is not the same as causing trouble; as soon as the cops came up, I said: &quot;look</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.120" end="01:48:42.080" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do exactly what you tell me to do right now, and I&#39;m not gonna cause any trouble</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.080" end="01:48:48.180" style="s2">but I would like you to hear what actually happened,&quot; that&#39;s a good example of a situation like that</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.180" end="01:48:53.920" style="s2">if someone&#39;s got you, no bravado, it&#39;s a very bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.920" end="01:48:59.880" style="s2">and I was going to do exactly what they told me, because they didn&#39;t know who I was</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.880" end="01:49:03.400" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t know what they had been told</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.400" end="01:49:10.460" style="s2">anyhow, the problem with lying is that it&#39;s a hydra, and kids find out this very early</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.460" end="01:49:15.900" style="s2">&#39;cause you tell one lie, and what happens is it has one of the consequences you&#39;d expect, maybe you get away with it</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.900" end="01:49:21.700" style="s2">but it has 3 or 4 others that you don&#39;t expect, and it&#39;s like it grows some complexity</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.700" end="01:49:27.980" style="s2">and then you have to tack a lie on each of those little complexity outcrops, and then they grow three more complexities</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.980" end="01:49:34.920" style="s2">and soon this little lie turns into a great big ball of lies, and at some point it becomes painfully evident to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.920" end="01:49:39.960" style="s2">and by that time you&#39;re in such... you see this with politicians, like that guy who was sexting</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.960" end="01:49:44.480" style="s2">Anthony Weiner, and perfect name for him, man, it&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.480" end="01:49:48.460" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t make that comment &#39;cause it&#39;s so obvious, but it&#39;s still funny</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.460" end="01:49:54.300" style="s2">but that&#39;s exactly what happened to him, it wasn&#39;t even so much the event</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.300" end="01:50:00.480" style="s2">because people are stupid, they make mistakes, and actually the public is somewhat forgiving</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.480" end="01:50:07.680" style="s2">if you say: &quot;yeah, geez, I&#39;m a real moron, like really, seriously, how could I do that? but I did</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.680" end="01:50:14.840" style="s2">I&#39;ll try not to do it again&quot;; but what happens with politicians is... and I&#39;m not speaking specifically of politicians</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.840" end="01:50:19.320" style="s2">they&#39;ll make an error and it gets exposed, and then they&#39;ll make three others, trying to cover it up</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.320" end="01:50:23.780" style="s2">it happened with Nixon, for example, and then the whole thing turns into a complete scandal</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.780" end="01:50:28.780" style="s2">and maybe they could&#39;ve got out of it at the beginning by just telling the truth</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.780" end="01:50:34.300" style="s2">&quot;yes, I&#39;m an idiot, I&#39;ll try not to do it again&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.300" end="01:50:41.680" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what happens in this case, and Pinokio grows this elaborate series of lies</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.680" end="01:50:47.460" style="s2">and the fairy is willing to be a little generous to him, because he&#39;s little and cute, and he&#39;s still a puppet</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.460" end="01:50:51.940" style="s2">and she tells him not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.940" end="01:50:59.380" style="s2">and that she&#39;s gonna give him a pass this time, but that she isn&#39;t gonna be able to intervene on his behalf again</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.380" end="01:51:04.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly... one of the things that&#39;s quite interesting about people who have Rousseauian ideas about children</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.760" end="01:51:10.400" style="s2">so: children are all good, and they get corrupted by society, which is half true</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.400" end="01:51:15.580" style="s2">because they&#39;re also not good, and they get shaped and disciplined by society</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.580" end="01:51:21.000" style="s2">but the Rousseauian types often are very interesting when their kids hit teenage years</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.000" end="01:51:25.760" style="s2">or when they&#39;re judging, say, criminal teenagers</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.760" end="01:51:31.740" style="s2">it&#39;s like the child is perfect until they hit like 11, then they turn into a teenager, and the they&#39;re like thugs</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.740" end="01:51:37.140" style="s2">so they go from good to thug in one move; and you often see that in families, too</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.140" end="01:51:41.960" style="s2">that have treated especially their daughters like a princess, and then they hit puberty</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.960" end="01:51:47.220" style="s2">and the parents who have princessed them to death have no idea what to do with them</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.220" end="01:51:54.480" style="s2">so then they become demonized, so the overly good child turn into the overly wicket teenager</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.480" end="01:52:03.160" style="s2">and sometimes they&#39;ll act that out, too, one of the things I&#39;ve seen with girls who are held in princess esteem when they&#39;re little</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.160" end="01:52:07.480" style="s2">and their parents have to tight [sic] a grip on them, and too much of a demand for good behavior</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.480" end="01:52:14.740" style="s2">is they&#39;ll find some nasty character associate with, who will tear them out of the family, bikers are really good for that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.740" end="01:52:22.500" style="s2">and especially if you have some vengeful thoughts towards your parents, a nice biker is your perfect solution to that problem</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.500" end="01:52:33.280" style="s2">okay, we&#39;ll go through this scene, and then I think we&#39;ll call it a day</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.280" end="01:52:39.680" style="s2">so now Pinokio&#39;s gone free, he&#39;s been reunited with his conscience, he&#39;s learned a couple of lessons</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.680" end="01:52:44.580" style="s2">1. don&#39;t be an actor, 2. and don&#39;t lie, and those things are quite similar</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.580" end="01:52:50.680" style="s2">and especially once you&#39;re caught in your actor trap, don&#39;t lie to get out, &#39;cause that will just make it worse</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.680" end="01:52:56.620" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first of his trials, his moral trials on the road to becoming real</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.620" end="01:53:01.540" style="s2">now here we&#39;re at a different place, we&#39;re at this... I think it&#39;s called the Red Lobster Inn</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.540" end="01:53:08.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s a shadowy place, kind of cave-like, it&#39;s an underground entrance to somewhere that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.820" end="01:53:15.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s a foggy night, and you can&#39;t really see, so everything&#39;s murky and gloomy there</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.260" end="01:53:23.060" style="s2">inside we see the coachman and the fox and the cat</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.060" end="01:53:29.480" style="s2">and the coachman&#39;s a bad guy, he&#39;s that mask that we saw first of all</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.480" end="01:53:34.340" style="s2">he&#39;s the archetype of that mask that was judgmental about Pinokio having a voice</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.340" end="01:53:41.840" style="s2">one of the things Jung said about the shadow, and this is, I would say, one of the primary impediments to enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.840" end="01:53:49.520" style="s2">is that if you start looking at your motives for misbehaving, and I mean by that something very specific</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.520" end="01:53:54.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean that you&#39;re misbehaving by someone else&#39;s standards, I don&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.520" end="01:54:01.100" style="s2">I mean: when you know by your own standards that you&#39;re doing something that devious or malevolent or underhanded</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.100" end="01:54:06.120" style="s2">you know it, and you still do it, so it&#39;s your own judgment you&#39;re bringing to bear on yourself</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.120" end="01:54:12.860" style="s2">if you look at why you&#39;re doing that, the longer you look at it, the deeper a hole you dig</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.860" end="01:54:17.120" style="s2">this is the motif of Dante&#39;s Inferno, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.120" end="01:54:25.940" style="s2">Dante&#39;s Inferno is a story about, I can&#39;t remember his name, unfortunately; might be Dante, in fact</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.940" end="01:54:33.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember; he&#39;s led into hell by Virgil, who is an ancient philosopher, thinker [he was a poet]</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.640" end="01:54:42.740" style="s2">and hell has levels, so the outer level is... and this is a christianised version of hell, because there&#39;s hells of all sorts</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.740" end="01:54:49.580" style="s2">but this is a christianised version; on the outermost levels of hell, which is sort of like normal life</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.580" end="01:54:53.820" style="s2">are the ancient philosophers, and they&#39;re still in hell, because they weren&#39;t christian</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.820" end="01:55:00.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s like cheap motel hell instead of the full pit thing</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.000" end="01:55:06.860" style="s2">so then Dante goes deeper and deeper into hell, until he gets right to the bottom of it</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.860" end="01:55:13.520" style="s2">it&#39;s been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, Satan himself is encased in ice at the bottom of hell</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.520" end="01:55:22.400" style="s2">surrounded by people who betray others; so Dante&#39;s notion was that worst of all possible violations of  moral behavior</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.400" end="01:55:28.400" style="s2">was betrayal, they&#39;re in the deepest levels hell, and I really like that idea, I think it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.400" end="01:55:34.180" style="s2">because if you trust me, then you&#39;re manifesting the necessary courage that puts someone through life</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.180" end="01:55:41.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re smart, you don&#39;t trust me &#39;cause you&#39;re naive, you trust me knowing that I&#39;m full of snakes, and so are you</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.240" end="01:55:45.180" style="s2">but maybe we can cooperate, and move things along nicely</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.180" end="01:55:50.080" style="s2">we can reduce each other to our word, and we can cooperate</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.080" end="01:55:58.960" style="s2">but you&#39;re awake, and then I betray that, then I&#39;m undermining your necessary faith in life and humanity</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.960" end="01:56:03.960" style="s2">and you can really hurt someone that way; sometimes it&#39;s self-betrayal</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.960" end="01:56:09.380" style="s2">but you can really do someone in, you can really traumatize them, so that they can&#39;t recover</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.380" end="01:56:14.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s a really terrible thing to do to someone, and maybe it&#39;s the worst thing, and that was Dante&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.640" end="01:56:20.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s tied in... that makes very interesting reading, if you read it at the same time as Milton&#39;s Paradise Lost</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.920" end="01:56:29.300" style="s2">because those metaphysical explorations, this is what they are, they&#39;re metaphysical explorations of the terrible places you can end up</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.300" end="01:56:35.680" style="s2">and that people do end up, and also a metaphysical explanation of what spirit takes you there</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.680" end="01:56:42.360" style="s2">&#39;cause you might ask: &quot;well, why do you betray someone?&quot; and that is a deep question</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.360" end="01:56:46.440" style="s2">so you&#39;ll have your specific reasons, but under that there&#39;ll be some other reasons</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.440" end="01:56:50.200" style="s2">and under that there&#39;ll be some other reasons, and under that there&#39;ll be some other reasons</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.200" end="01:56:54.800" style="s2">and if you all the way to the bottom, you come up with the ultimate reasons why you  betrayed someone</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.800" end="01:56:57.940" style="s2">and when you look at that, that will not be pretty</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.940" end="01:57:03.880" style="s2">that&#39;s when your proclivity for evil, let&#39;s say, unites with the general human proclivity for evil</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.880" end="01:57:07.540" style="s2">and you discover just exactly what you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.540" end="01:57:14.100" style="s2">Jung&#39;s notion was that that was a full encounter with the shadow, which is I suppose partly what this course is about</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.100" end="01:57:20.160" style="s2">because one of the things I believe I told you at the beginning was that I was going to try and help you understand</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.160" end="01:57:24.680" style="s2">how it might be that you could be an Auschwitz guard</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.680" end="01:57:28.960" style="s2">and to really understand that, that&#39;s a horrifying thing to understand</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.960" end="01:57:34.840" style="s2">but I&#39;ll tell you, if you wanna grow some teeth, that&#39;s a really good thing to understand</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.840" end="01:57:43.260" style="s2">so we were talking about your capacity to negotiate before, if you aren&#39;t a monster, you cannot negotiate</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.260" end="01:57:49.700" style="s2">but if you&#39;ve got that under control, then you don&#39;t have to be a monster</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.700" end="01:57:58.700" style="s2">it&#39;s really paradoxical, so if you&#39;re just naive, well, you end up in jail, and a marionette master has control over you</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.700" end="01:58:03.700" style="s2">that&#39;s not helpful, so that&#39;s not good, that just means you&#39;re useless, and you can be manipulated</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.700" end="01:58:08.020" style="s2">you won&#39;t go out of your way to be malevolent, but it&#39;s mostly because you just don&#39;t have the skills</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.020" end="01:58:16.080" style="s2">the organizational skills, or even the depth to do that; you&#39;re good because you&#39;re harmless, that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.080" end="01:58:20.380" style="s2">that&#39;s easily manipulated, so you think, well, how do you get out of that?</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.380" end="01:58:25.840" style="s2">partly, you watch people, because you know what they&#39;re like, because you know what you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.840" end="01:58:30.440" style="s2">but you also know what you could do, and would do if you were pushed</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.440" end="01:58:36.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to show much of that when you&#39;re negotiating with someone for them to take you really seriously</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.320" end="01:58:46.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange thing; but one of the things Jung pointed out, too, was that what you most need to know will be found where you least want to look</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.340" end="01:58:49.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s &#39;cause you haven&#39;t already looked there</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.100" end="01:58:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a little different for everyone, right, &#39;cause your particular place you don&#39;t wanna look isn&#39;t gonna be the same as your place</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.440" end="01:59:00.920" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna have a place you don&#39;t wanna look, and what you haven&#39;t discovered, that&#39;s where it is</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.920" end="01:59:07.200" style="s2">that&#39;s partly going to be discovered by you looking at what you&#39;re capable of, what you&#39;re truly capable of</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.200" end="01:59:14.620" style="s2">people, especially on the compassionate end, think: &quot;I could never be brutal like that&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.620" end="01:59:20.660" style="s2">and that could be true, but you can kill people with compassion, no problem, that&#39;s the Freudian oedipal situation</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.660" end="01:59:26.360" style="s2">so think about working in a nursing home, there&#39;s actually a rule of thumb, which I also use</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.360" end="01:59:30.940" style="s2">to guide my interactions with children, and also with my clients, and I would say with people in general</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.940" end="01:59:38.280" style="s2">*do not do anything for anyone that they can&#39;t do themselves,* you just steal it from them</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.280" end="01:59:43.880" style="s2">so imagine you&#39;re working with really elderly people, they have Alzheimer&#39;s, it&#39;s really easy to do things for them</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.880" end="01:59:51.560" style="s2">because, well, &quot;easy&quot;, &#39;cause it&#39;s really a hard job, but it might be easier to do something for them than to let them struggle through it</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.560" end="01:59:56.780" style="s2">but you just speed their demise by taking away the last vestiges of their independence</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.780" end="02:00:02.740" style="s2">you do the same thing with kids, it&#39;s like: &quot;struggle through it, man&quot;; did you ever see &quot;My Left Foot?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.740" end="02:00:09.900" style="s2">that&#39;s a great movie, it&#39;s about this author whose name escapes me at the moment, brilliant movie</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.900" end="02:00:16.780" style="s2">the person who played the part, Daniel Day-Lewis, I think he won an Academy Award for it</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.780" end="02:00:24.920" style="s2">it&#39;s about this author in Ireland, I think he had cerebral palsy, and he could really do was use his left foot</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.920" end="02:00:29.320" style="s2">that was it, the rest of him was pretty spastic and not controllable</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.320" end="02:00:34.300" style="s2">but he was there, he was very intelligent, he was with it, and his dad would not help him</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.300" end="02:00:39.480" style="s2">he had to drag himself um the damn stairs with his left foot, he just would not help him</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.480" end="02:00:45.100" style="s2">and what happened was, he learned how to live, he could function</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.100" end="02:00:50.640" style="s2">the book and the movie is called &quot;My Left Foot&quot;, and it does a lovely job of laying that out</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.640" end="02:00:57.640" style="s2">but you have to be one hard-hearted son of a bitch to let your son crawl up the stairs with his left foot over and over</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.640" end="02:01:04.120" style="s2">think about that; but what&#39;s the alternative? if he would have been... and of course he lays this out in the book</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.120" end="02:01:12.780" style="s2">if he would have been catered to, he would have ended up just like you&#39;d expect someone who was always catered to</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.780" end="02:01:24.540" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very nice lesson in the triumph of fostering independence over too casual compassion</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.540" end="02:01:30.100" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would say; so you look at the Coachman here, kind of looks like a demented Santa Claus</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.100" end="02:01:36.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a beard, but... it&#39;s a nice touch on the animators&#39; part, he&#39;s even got a pipe and the red suit</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.600" end="02:01:42.840" style="s2">and so he&#39;s listening to the fox and the cat brag about how much money they made selling Pinokio to the Puppet Master</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.840" end="02:01:47.280" style="s2">and how evil and terrible they are, they&#39;re bragging away, and he&#39;s the real thing, eh</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.280" end="02:01:55.820" style="s2">he&#39;s the real thing, and he can see through their little petty, narcissistic, grandiose tales of quasi-criminality</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.820" end="02:02:02.340" style="s2">and has nothing but contempt for, and you can see that in his facial expression, it&#39;s like he&#39;s sitting back a bit, thinking:</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.340" end="02:02:05.520" style="s2">&quot;keep talking, bucko, pretty soon I&#39;m gonna have you right where I want you&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.520" end="02:02:10.020" style="s2">the fox and the cat are drinking beer and smoking cigarettes, and talking about how evil they are</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.020" end="02:02:18.520" style="s2">and bragging about how they got one over on like a four-year-old; real impressive, guys, real impressive</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.520" end="02:02:26.580" style="s2">and the Coachman is thinking up his own nefarious schemes right now, what he might do with that puppet if he got his hands on him</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.580" end="02:02:32.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s when he reveals himself, so what you see... the filmmakers just do it for a second</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.040" end="02:02:38.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s an archetypal trip, you&#39;ve got the fox and the cat, they&#39;re sort of petty examples of criminality and evil</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.880" end="02:02:43.760" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got the coachman, and he&#39;s the real thing, but he&#39;s not really showing anybody who he is</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.760" end="02:02:48.920" style="s2">and then in one scene in the bar he lets his guard down, and he lets them see what he&#39;s really like</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.920" end="02:02:55.520" style="s2">and so you see this: all teeth and predatory eyes and glee all at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.520" end="02:03:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad combination, &quot;I&#39;m going to eat you, and it&#39;s going to make me very happy&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.880" end="02:03:04.680" style="s2">that&#39;s insanity, you do not wanna see that look on someone&#39;s face</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.680" end="02:03:09.900" style="s2">so that&#39;s the look; and the fox is traumatized by that</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.900" end="02:03:16.000" style="s2">he thinks he&#39;s a bad guy, and he&#39;s not, he&#39;s just... he just can&#39;t be a good guy</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.000" end="02:03:21.200" style="s2">he hasn&#39;t got the talent to be a bad guy; and then he&#39;s talking to the coachman and bragging</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.200" end="02:03:28.260" style="s2">and the Coachman&#39;s had enough of it, he shows his real face, and it&#39;s like that&#39;s not good, the Fox gets a real glimpse into hell</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.260" end="02:03:35.020" style="s2">and that just terrifies him; and the other thing the Coachman does is revel his plans</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.020" end="02:03:42.100" style="s2">and his plans are to kidnap Pinokio along with a bunch of other boys, and to take them to this place called Pleasure Island</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.100" end="02:03:50.780" style="s2">and the Fox knows what&#39;s going on there, it&#39;s the foreshadowing of the next stage of the adventure</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.780" end="02:04:03.220" style="s2">after the Fox and the Cat are terrified, the Coachman, who takes you along with him</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.220" end="02:04:08.160" style="s2">has a little chat with them, and they describe exactly what they&#39;re going to do next</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.160" end="02:04:11.820" style="s2">and the Fox and the Cat know perfectly well that they&#39;re over their head</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.820" end="02:04:16.200" style="s2">but at this point in their misadventures there&#39;s no pulling back</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.200" end="02:04:23.520" style="s2">and I think we&#39;ll stop there, even though it&#39;s a little early, because that was a lot of material, and this is a really good place to stop</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.520" end="02:04:29.140" style="s2">I&#39;d be happy to take some questions if you guys have some questions</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.140" end="02:04:34.080" style="s2">we could take questions for like 10 minutes, and then we&#39;ll call it a day</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.080" end="02:04:39.040" style="s2">and you can ask me a question about anything you want</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.040" end="02:04:45.040" style="s2">[student] this goes back to the beginning of the lecture, but how does morality go from</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.040" end="02:04:50.840" style="s2">[student] who&#39;s stronger and who&#39;s weaker to what&#39;s good and what isn&#39;t?</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.840" end="02:04:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll, I think it depends to some degree on what you mean by stronger</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.200" end="02:04:59.440" style="s2">so physical strength is one element, if you look at mythological heroes...</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.440" end="02:05:08.020" style="s2">imagine that the stories of heroes are fragmented elements of the archetype</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.020" end="02:05:13.000" style="s2">and so one kind of archetypal hero, obviously, is someone who&#39;s physically strong</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.000" end="02:05:18.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a great movie that you could watch about this, it&#39;s called Hitman Hart</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.040" end="02:05:21.980" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the best documentaries I&#39;ve ever seen, and it&#39;s about this guy named Brett Hart</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.980" end="02:05:26.180" style="s2">and Brett Hart was for a while the most famous Canadian on the planet</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.180" end="02:05:31.740" style="s2">and he was a World Wide Wrestling Foundation? what do the call it? WWF?</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.740" end="02:05:36.460" style="s2">[WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment] yeah, he was their lead good guy</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.460" end="02:05:43.880" style="s2">... I love the documentary, &#39;cause when I was a little kid, like 4 or 5, I used to to watch his father, whose name was Stu Hart</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.880" end="02:05:49.140" style="s2">who ran this channel, this wrestling confederation in Alberta</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.140" end="02:05:54.200" style="s2">and Stu Hart had I think 8 boys, and he trained all of then to be pro wrestlers</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.200" end="02:05:59.240" style="s2">and part of the movie is extraordinarily funny, &#39;cause Stu Hart is in it, and he&#39;s really old</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.240" end="02:06:06.740" style="s2">he&#39;s like 85, and he&#39;s just barely... can you imagine he was like a pro wrestler for 40 years? every joint is broken</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.740" end="02:06:13.240" style="s2">and he&#39;s still big, but he&#39;s just barely moving, and this kid and another kid come over</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.240" end="02:06:18.980" style="s2">and Stu is telling the story about how he used to take his boys into the basement and toughen them up</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.980" end="02:06:23.020" style="s2">I think Brett called that the journey to pain or something like that</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.020" end="02:06:28.740" style="s2">his father would take all these kids down there and wrestle with them, and push them right to the edge of their pain tolerance, constantly</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.740" end="02:06:35.560" style="s2">and anyways, they grew up tough, there&#39;s no doubt about that, and all his daughters married pro wrestlers, too</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.560" end="02:06:39.440" style="s2">and I think he has 7 daughters, so he&#39;s quite the character</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.440" end="02:06:43.680" style="s2">anyways, these two kids, they&#39;re late adolescents, early adulthood, come over</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.680" end="02:06:48.800" style="s2">and one of them is pretty damn cocky, and he&#39;s listening to Stu, and he says something smart</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.800" end="02:06:52.000" style="s2">like &quot;well, you know, you were pretty tough in the old days, eh?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.000" end="02:06:55.720" style="s2">and Stu looks at him and says: &quot;why don&#39;t you come down to the basement with me?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.720" end="02:07:02.420" style="s2">and he says: &quot;look, I don&#39;t wanna hurt you, old man&quot;; so the filmmakers follow them into the basement</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.420" end="02:07:10.060" style="s2">and they&#39;re kinda standing there, that old guy grabs him in a headlock, he&#39;s like a snake, eh?</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.060" end="02:07:14.560" style="s2">he&#39;s got him in a headlock so fast, the kid doesn&#39;t what to do, and then...</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.560" end="02:07:24.940" style="s2">Stu, he knows how to put a headlock on someone; he&#39;s flexing his forearm, which is still not so bad a forearm</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.940" end="02:07:33.240" style="s2">and this guy&#39;s face is just... it&#39;s like he&#39;s stepped in a  bear trap, plus he&#39;s absolutely shocked that this old guy got him</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.240" end="02:07:36.660" style="s2">so he&#39;s kind of gasping, and Stu says something like:</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.660" end="02:07:41.840" style="s2">&quot;you watch, if I flex this muscle just right, you can see this vein on his forehead start to pop out&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.840" end="02:07:45.700" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinarily funny<br />[Peterson misremembered the scene in some key points, watch it for yourself]</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.700" end="02:07:49.260" style="s2">anyways, Brett Hart plays out the good guy archetype, and Brett&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.260" end="02:07:55.180" style="s2">he&#39;s a solid guy, but I would say he&#39;s not particularly sophisticated, and I&#39;m not being cruel about that</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.180" end="02:07:58.240" style="s2">I mean he had a great career, and he&#39;s tough as a boot, so good for him</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.240" end="02:08:04.000" style="s2">but he plays out this good guy archetype and he gets tangled up in it</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.000" end="02:08:09.400" style="s2">now, I don&#39;t remember your damn question, but I am trying to answer it, tell me the question again</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.400" end="02:08:16.060" style="s2">[student] so I was wondering how in morality you go from to who&#39;s strongest and who&#39;s weakest to what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.060" end="02:08:22.440" style="s2">oh yes, exactly; one of the things I really liked about this movie was it showed me why people watch wrestling</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.440" end="02:08:26.200" style="s2">and I couldn&#39;t... because certainly they&#39;re not appealing...</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.200" end="02:08:35.780" style="s2">and I&#39;m not being... there are different strata of conception of abstraction that any entertainment process has to appeal to</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.780" end="02:08:45.580" style="s2">and most people don&#39;t go to movies, and that actually... it really is because movies operate at a level of sophistication that is too high for many people</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.580" end="02:08:55.800" style="s2">just like novels, hardly anyone reads; 15% of the population, might be 20%, cannot read well enough to follow written instructions</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.800" end="02:09:04.100" style="s2">and there are people, maybe it&#39;s 15% of the population or 10%, who have never finished a book, never</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.100" end="02:09:12.680" style="s2">and it is that high; but the archetype still needs to manifest itself on different levels</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.680" end="02:09:18.560" style="s2">and so it manifests itself in wrestling; but even there, where it is physical force, it&#39;s not just physical force</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.560" end="02:09:24.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a drama between good and evil, and you can see this so clearly in the Brett Hart documentary</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.340" end="02:09:29.600" style="s2">&#39;cause he&#39;s the good guy; the bad guys are really over-the-top bad, it&#39;s a real drama</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.600" end="02:09:35.240" style="s2">it&#39;s good versus evil in the ring every time, and hopefully good wins, but good often gets...</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.240" end="02:09:41.080" style="s2">maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his friends in, and they bring in chairs, and they bash the hell out of the good guy</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.080" end="02:09:47.360" style="s2">and the whole audience is just outraged by this, and the documentary does a lovely job of showing that</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.360" end="02:09:54.360" style="s2">so even at the level of physical combat, let&#39;s say, you can&#39;t reduce what&#39;s good to what&#39;s strong</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.360" end="02:09:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just one element of it; better to be strong than to be weak</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.240" end="02:10:02.720" style="s2">and so you can have strong hero, because it&#39;s better to be strong than to be weak</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.720" end="02:10:06.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s better to be strong and kind than to be strong</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.320" end="02:10:10.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s better to be strong and kind and wise than to be strong and kind</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.180" end="02:10:17.420" style="s2">and that&#39;s true not only in human beings, but it&#39;s even true, let&#39;s say, at the wolf or chimpanzee level</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.420" end="02:10:22.600" style="s2">because one of the things you see with the chimp dominance hierarchies, and I think I mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.600" end="02:10:30.800" style="s2">is if the leader, the dominant male, is really good at fostering social relations and being reciprocal in acts like grooming</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.800" end="02:10:36.740" style="s2">and also paying attention to the females and their offspring, his dynasty will be much more stable</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.740" end="02:10:44.940" style="s2">and so, strong might be good for one battle, it might be good for two battles, but for 50 battles it&#39;s not optimized</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.940" end="02:10:49.740" style="s2">especially because no matter how strong you are, someone can take you out</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.740" end="02:10:58.180" style="s2">so what happens is the idea of what&#39;s ideal becomes increasingly complex across time, multifaceted</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.180" end="02:11:05.160" style="s2">and so: strength, wisdom, intelligence, vision, all these things are amalgamated into a single being</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.160" end="02:11:09.620" style="s2">and we&#39;ll talk a lot about that, because I wanna show you how that happened in Mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.620" end="02:11:13.860" style="s2">because that&#39;s one of the first places where we have documentation about how that ideal emerged</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.860" end="02:11:17.440" style="s2">they had a god called Marduk, and Marduk had 50 names</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.440" end="02:11:24.620" style="s2">and as far as I can tell, the reason for that was that Marduk was an amalgam of the tribal deities of at least 50 tribes</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.620" end="02:11:31.080" style="s2">and when the tribes were brought together, and civilized, each of their gods, who were ideals-</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.080" end="02:11:38.360" style="s2">had to be amalgamated into something that was a single dramatized representation of value</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.360" end="02:11:41.700" style="s2">or there was no way that all those people could have lived together</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.700" end="02:11:46.760" style="s2">their different value structures would have fragmented them, and they would have stayed in a state of war</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.760" end="02:11:51.940" style="s2">so the question is... it&#39;s the question you&#39;re asking: if it&#39;s not strength, then what is it?</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.940" end="02:11:59.980" style="s2">well, strength is an element, but the Egyptians figured out that it was vision, it was actually the capacity to pay attention</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.980" end="02:12:04.060" style="s2">that was paramount, and the Mesopotamians had that figured out more or less too</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.060" end="02:12:08.400" style="s2">because their god Marduk had eyes all the way around his head, he could see everywhere</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.400" end="02:12:15.500" style="s2">so seeing was a critical element of what should be on top, and the other thing for the Mesopotamians was the ability to speak</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.500" end="02:12:20.520" style="s2">so by the time of Mesopotamia people had already dramatized the idea</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.520" end="02:12:24.920" style="s2">that cardinal human attributes are vision and the ability to speak</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.920" end="02:12:29.780" style="s2">and the ability to speak the truth, too, not just speak</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.780" end="02:12:32.800" style="s2">other questions?</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.800" end="02:12:40.920" style="s2">[student] so, I wasn&#39;t really aware of what you just said that most people don&#39;t watch movies</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.920" end="02:12:49.580" style="s2">[student] because I&#39;ve probably watched [unintelligible] so is that why we sort of consider... &#39;cause we were talking about celebrity career</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.580" end="02:13:01.400" style="s2">[student] that different levels of abstraction of celebrity are respected more? like reality TV probably lower than ... Cumberbatch, than like a theater actor, then like a novelist</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.400" end="02:13:06.240" style="s2">[Peterson] sure, yes, that&#39;s exactly why, because, you see</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.240" end="02:13:16.440" style="s2">the less sophisticated the genre, the more the genre is like real life</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.440" end="02:13:26.040" style="s2">and the more sophisticated it is, the more it has abstracted out across instances of real life the fundamental lessons</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.040" end="02:13:31.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s what makes something profound and deep, it&#39;s abstracted from multiple sources</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.620" end="02:13:37.200" style="s2">and it applies across multiple dimensions; &#39;cause that&#39;s what you want, and here is why</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.200" end="02:13:46.460" style="s2">fundamentally, you have a problem, but that&#39;s not the problem, the problem is that there are problems</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.460" end="02:13:50.740" style="s2">so the problem is a metaproblem: there are problems</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.740" end="02:13:58.040" style="s2">you need a solution to that, that&#39;s not a solution to a problem, that&#39;s a metasolution to the class of problems</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.040" end="02:14:04.360" style="s2">right, and that&#39;s what people have been trying to figure out ever since we were able to actually figure things out</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.360" end="02:14:10.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not: &quot;how do you solve a problem&quot;, it&#39;s: &quot;how do you act so that you solve the problem of problems&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.760" end="02:14:16.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s basically the complexity of life and the fact that you&#39;re mortal and vulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.320" end="02:14:22.100" style="s2">[student] so then a follow-up question, from your book you have this sort of strata</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.100" end="02:14:29.660" style="s2">from play all the way up to religion and beyond that, sort of looking back retroactively with philosophy and rationality</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.660" end="02:14:37.420" style="s2">[muted]</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.420" end="02:14:43.580" style="s2">well that&#39;s a  good one, because I would say [muted]</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.580" end="02:14:48.520" style="s2">if you really wanna think this through, the best way to do that is to read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.520" end="02:14:53.620" style="s2">now, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other ways of doing this; but Nietzsche was actually quite heavily influenced by Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.620" end="02:14:57.900" style="s2">more than people knew, although their thought runs very parallel</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.900" end="02:15:05.040" style="s2">Dostoevsky is like the ultimate dramatist, he embodies his ideas, and he has them act out in a dramatic space</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.040" end="02:15:10.440" style="s2">it&#39;s literary; whereas Nietzsche has taken that up one level of abstraction, to the semantic</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.440" end="02:15:15.560" style="s2">he says: &quot;well, here&#39;s what&#39;s going on&quot; in an articulated way, but he doesn&#39;t embody it in a story</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.560" end="02:15:19.120" style="s2">and you might say: &quot;well, that&#39;s higher&quot;, but it&#39;s only higher in a way</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.120" end="02:15:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s more abstract in that it&#39;s more like words</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.440" end="02:15:27.240" style="s2">whereas what Dostoevsky does is half words and half images</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.240" end="02:15:34.640" style="s2">because when you read a novel what happens is that... people say,  postmodernists say: &quot;where the hell is the meaning in that novel?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.640" end="02:15:40.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the word, it&#39;s not in the phrase, it&#39;s not in the sentence, it&#39;s not in the paragraph, where do you localize the meaning?</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.920" end="02:15:45.260" style="s2">great question, their answer sucks, bu the question&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.260" end="02:15:55.000" style="s2">but what happens partly when you&#39;re reading a book, a novel, is that the words trigger representations in your imagination</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.000" end="02:16:04.660" style="s2">a lot of what you extract the information from is actually your imagistic representation of the words</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.660" end="02:16:12.340" style="s2">and that imagistic representation is richer than the words, because it&#39;s informed by all of your knowledge about people</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.340" end="02:16:18.520" style="s2">you know this happens, because you go to a movie, like the Harry Potter movies, and you say: &quot;that&#39;s not how I imagined it&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.520" end="02:16:24.240" style="s2">the probability that there&#39;ll be a 1:1 correspondence between your internal representation of the book</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.240" end="02:16:28.620" style="s2">and the movie is 0; and usually the movie is less rich than the book</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.620" end="02:16:33.500" style="s2">I love movies, and they have their own place, that&#39;s for sure, but...</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.500" end="02:16:39.500" style="s2">well, miniseries, the series now are more approaching the complexity and depth of literature</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.500" end="02:16:49.060" style="s2">because they can extend across 20 hours, they don&#39;t have to compress a 12-hour reading experience into 2 hours of  action</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.060" end="02:16:54.300" style="s2">what I was trying to do with that hierarchy was to show how the knowledge moved</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.300" end="02:17:01.200" style="s2">first of all it&#39;s kind of implicit in your biology, and then it&#39;s distributed into society</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.200" end="02:17:06.820" style="s2">and then by imitating society you make it part of your procedures, and then you watch your own procedures</p>
<p begin="02:17:06.820" end="02:17:11.460" style="s2">and start to build a representation of them, and then you can articulate that representation</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.460" end="02:17:19.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s a bootstrapping process, too, because once you&#39;ve made the representation, that can affect the way you behave</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.320" end="02:17:31.080" style="s2">so they start to loop; so here&#39;s one idea, imagine that there&#39;s a type of male who tends to win dominance hierarchy contests</p>
<p begin="02:17:31.080" end="02:17:36.800" style="s2">and to emerge at the top, well that&#39;s the case, and that&#39;s why you&#39;re the way you are</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.800" end="02:17:40.080" style="s2">so what&#39;s happened among human beings, this is so cool</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.080" end="02:17:48.300" style="s2">is that human females are choosy maters, so about twice as many men fail in their reproductive efforts as females fail</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.300" end="02:17:54.420" style="s2">but the men who succeed are more successful; so women are on average more successful</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.420" end="02:17:58.120" style="s2">and men are on average more failures and more successful</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.120" end="02:18:03.520" style="s2">and I&#39;m talking strictly about reproduction here, although it generalizes to other areas, but I&#39;m talking about reproduction</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.520" end="02:18:10.360" style="s2">so how does it work, exactly? well, the women have a real problem with mate selection</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.360" end="02:18:16.780" style="s2">who the hell are you gonna have as a mate? it&#39;s too complex to work out, so women in their genius don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.780" end="02:18:19.440" style="s2">they let the men compete, and then they peel from the top</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.440" end="02:18:25.200" style="s2">acting out the assumption that the man who wins is the best man, and it&#39;s a good assumption</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.200" end="02:18:30.380" style="s2">because if you have a bunch of men competing, especially if they&#39;re competing across competitions</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.380" end="02:18:34.600" style="s2">and someone pops up at the top, you can think: &quot;well, they may not be worth much,</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.600" end="02:18:37.700" style="s2">but they&#39;re better than anyone else at whatever it is  that they&#39;re doing&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.700" end="02:18:41.120" style="s2">and that makes men at the top of dominance hierarchies very attractive to women</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.120" end="02:18:46.280" style="s2">an then the women accelerate that, so you can imagine they&#39;re more likely to reproduce</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.280" end="02:18:52.100" style="s2">so what happens is the proclivity to emerge at the top of the set of dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.100" end="02:18:59.820" style="s2">becomes inbuilt into the biology across time, and the women exaggerate that by differentially allowing the men to reproduce</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.820" end="02:19:06.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s also why they&#39;re mother nature, they really are mother nature, it&#39;s not just a metaphor</p>
<p begin="02:19:06.240" end="02:19:11.280" style="s2">then the representation and the biology start to tangle together</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.280" end="02:19:19.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s like, well, that&#39;s the difference between a meme and an archetype, a meme is this idea that propagates itself</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.300" end="02:19:28.300" style="s2">but an archetype is an idea that has propagated itself across such a massivespan of time that it&#39;s actually shaped the course of evolution itself</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.300" end="02:19:36.440" style="s2">and men, I can tell you already... it isn&#39;t necessarily that you even have to compete with other men</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.440" end="02:19:44.460" style="s2">in order to see who wins; as soon as you admire someone, and that&#39;ll happen unconsciously, you won&#39;t be able to stop yourself</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.460" end="02:19:51.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve already elevated them in the dominance hierarchy contest, the act of admiration is your recognition</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.200" end="02:19:58.180" style="s2">that you&#39;ve met someone who&#39;s better at whatever it is that happens to be driving your admiration than you are</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.180" end="02:20:08.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly the manifestation of just the idea as the, what would you say, as the representation of the ideal</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.160" end="02:20:14.660" style="s2">kids do that all the time, they hero worship other kids, usually like a 4-year old will latch on to a 6-year old</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.660" end="02:20:20.300" style="s2">who he or she will just follow everywhere, and do exactly what they do</p>
<p begin="02:20:20.300" end="02:20:30.940" style="s2">why? because that person represents to that child their next ideal, their conceptualization of the place forward</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.940" end="02:20:38.240" style="s2">any other questions? or should we maybe call it a day?</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.240" end="02:20:46.080" style="s2">[student] you said when the guy was smiling the thing was predatory glee</p>
<p begin="02:20:46.080" end="02:20:50.400" style="s2">[student] which is insanity, how do you define insanity in this context?</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.400" end="02:20:56.560" style="s2">well, let&#39;s call it what you don&#39;t wanna encounter alone in an alley at midnight</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.560" end="02:21:03.180" style="s2">and leave it at that, that is what I mean in this context, that&#39;s exactly what I mean</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.180" end="02:21:07.480" style="s2">and then not only is the person there waiting for you, but they&#39;re looking forward to whatever might happen</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.480" end="02:21:12.900" style="s2">[student] sure, I just mean in a psychological context, using that word has all kind of connotations</p>
<p begin="02:21:12.900" end="02:21:15.920" style="s2">[student] I was making sure I wasn&#39;t interpreting it in a wrong way</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.920" end="02:21:20.740" style="s2">no, well the movie provides the frame for the interpretation in this particular situation</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.740" end="02:21:28.720" style="s2">so he&#39;s the thing that hauls naive young boys off to their doom; OK, so that&#39;s bounded</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.720" end="02:21:42.840" style="s2">yes [student] could you elaborate on... you mentioned the process where people do the thing that&#39;s less hard but still hard?</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.840" end="02:21:50.700" style="s2">[student] facing the shadow [peterson] that&#39;s actually a really productive way of procrastinating, although it comes with its own problems of rationalization</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.700" end="02:22:02.540" style="s2">[student] that reinforces certain circuits ... [inaudible] bring up inhibitory circuits, and I was wondering if you can elaborate</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.540" end="02:22:17.660" style="s2">well, I&#39;ve derived that partly from my study of addiction and also from my study of recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p begin="02:22:17.660" end="02:22:26.700" style="s2">but let&#39;s talk about addiction, so there&#39;s a series of actions that occur before you take your cocaine</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.700" end="02:22:31.700" style="s2">some of those are local, they are the things that happen immediately before, and some of those are distal</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.700" end="02:22:38.620" style="s2">they&#39;re farther back in the chain of events; and when you have a hit of cocaine, it produces a dopaminergic burst</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.620" end="02:22:44.720" style="s2">and that feels really good, but it also makes the circuits that were immediately active before that grow</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.720" end="02:22:50.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what reinforcement is, and then the growth is proportionate, not linearly</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.320" end="02:22:57.940" style="s2">but it&#39;s proportionate to how long before that event occurred, the closer it is, the stronger they&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.940" end="02:23:01.140" style="s2">but even the ones that are somewhat distal get some reinforcement</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.140" end="02:23:06.840" style="s2">because you might say: &quot;well, what did you do before you found your latest fix?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:23:06.840" end="02:23:11.640" style="s2">and the answer is: &quot;how long before?&quot;; well, the closer, the more reward</p>
<p begin="02:23:11.640" end="02:23:17.480" style="s2">what happens then is that if you take that person out of the normal environment and you put them into a treatment center</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.480" end="02:23:24.680" style="s2">they&#39;re off they&#39;re physical addiction, which is a weird thing in the case of cocaine, but...</p>
<p begin="02:23:24.680" end="02:23:31.020" style="s2">like not that long, a week will do it, two weeks for sure, even heroin, and alcohol for sure</p>
<p begin="02:23:31.020" end="02:23:39.120" style="s2">if you can get them through the seizure part without dying; and so they&#39;re done, they&#39;re not physiologically dependent anymore</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.120" end="02:23:46.840" style="s2">but you let that person go, and the first thing that happens is his old friend who is always doing drugs with shows up</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.840" end="02:23:53.160" style="s2">and bang! he&#39;s craving like mad, and that&#39;s because that thing in there is not dead at all</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.160" end="02:23:59.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s activated by the cue, and it&#39;s a circuit... it&#39;s not, it&#39;s a personality</p>
<p begin="02:23:59.720" end="02:24:05.820" style="s2">it only wants one thing, it wants cocaine, it&#39;s gonna suppress any non-related thoughts</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.820" end="02:24:11.760" style="s2">and it&#39;ll use lies, that&#39;s no problem, especially if lies have been reinforced, which they certainly have</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.760" end="02:24:17.640" style="s2">&quot;where are you off to, son?&quot; you know, you&#39;ll have a lie for that, and then 10 minutes later you have your drug</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.640" end="02:24:23.120" style="s2">that little lie has just  grown; or maybe you think... you try to quit, you think: &quot;to hell with it!&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.120" end="02:24:29.500" style="s2">and every time, 10 minutes before you take your drug, you think &quot;to hell with it&quot;, and you do that a 1000 times</p>
<p begin="02:24:29.500" end="02:24:36.280" style="s2">well, believe me, that &quot;to hell with it&quot; circuit, that sucker is strong, it&#39;s alive</p>
<p begin="02:24:36.280" end="02:24:41.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s not like it just disappears, it can&#39;t, it&#39;s you, it&#39;s grown in there</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.500" end="02:24:49.200" style="s2">now, you can build another circuit to shut it down, and you can help it decompose across time by not giving it what it wants</p>
<p begin="02:24:49.200" end="02:24:55.780" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna have to not give it what it wants in all of the multiple contexts that you&#39;ve already associated with the drug</p>
<p begin="02:24:55.780" end="02:24:59.700" style="s2">some of you have probably smoked, and then tried to quit smoking, and what you see is</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.700" end="02:25:05.640" style="s2">you get a craving when you have a cup of coffee or when you finish dinner, when you&#39;re done having a phone call</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.640" end="02:25:12.360" style="s2">when you first get up in the morning, or whenever you regularly had the drug, whatever you had the drug in relationship to</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.360" end="02:25:16.880" style="s2">even complex things, like ending a conversation will produce a cue of craving</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.880" end="02:25:24.480" style="s2">then that can extinguish over time if you punish it by either punishing it or not letting it get what it wants</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.480" end="02:25:27.620" style="s2">but a lot you have to build another circuit to just shut it down</p>
<p begin="02:25:27.620" end="02:25:31.560" style="s2">and then that circuit&#39;s kinda  fragile and stress can often disrupt it</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.560" end="02:25:37.940" style="s2">[student] that can be mediated by [?] people read about quitting smoking or things like ibogaine</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.940" end="02:25:43.780" style="s2">oh sure, well, ibogaine&#39;s a whole different thing, because it seems to have a direct physiological effect</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.780" end="02:25:50.680" style="s2">but the addiction has a cognitive component, it&#39;s full of thoughts and desires and wants</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.680" end="02:25:57.780" style="s2">you know, you may have to rebuild your whole personality in order to get that thing cornered</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.780" end="02:26:02.200" style="s2">religious conversion, for example, is a really effective treatment for alcoholism</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.200" end="02:26:07.400" style="s2">that&#39;s partly why alcoholics anonymous works for the people for whom it does work</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.400" end="02:26:15.400" style="s2">but religious conversion, which is total personality conversion, is actually one of the few things that we know of that&#39;s an effective treatment for alcoholism</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.400" end="02:26:19.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to induce it, although that&#39;s not exactly true either</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.820" end="02:26:27.900" style="s2">because the early work with LSD... LSD was quite promising as a treatment for alcohol addiction</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.900" end="02:26:35.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s recent work with psylocybin showing that if people have a mystical experience when given psylocybin</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.960" end="02:26:39.160" style="s2">their success rate of quitting smoking is about 80%</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.160" end="02:26:43.240" style="s2">which is way higher than any pharmacological intervention for smoking has ever been</p>
<p begin="02:26:43.240" end="02:26:50.220" style="s2">alright, we should probably call it a day, we&#39;ll see you in a week</p>
