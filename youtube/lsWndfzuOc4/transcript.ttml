<p begin="00:07:50.980" end="00:07:54.140" style="s2">Good evening and welcome to the Sony Center for Performing Arts.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.700" end="00:07:59.000" style="s2">Please note: during tonight&#39;s presentation,</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.000" end="00:08:04.040" style="s2">video, audio, and flash photography is prohibited</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.340" end="00:08:10.500" style="s2">and we have a strict zero tolerance policy for any heckling or disruptions</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.920" end="00:08:22.360" style="s2">And now, please welcome</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.540" end="00:08:25.200" style="s2">your host and moderator,</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.200" end="00:08:27.200" style="s2">President of Ralston College</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.200" end="00:08:29.200" style="s2">Dr. Stephen Blackwood.</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.860" end="00:08:40.860" style="s2">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.860" end="00:08:43.840" style="s2">A warm welcome to all of you here this evening,</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.920" end="00:08:48.780" style="s2">both those here in the theater in Toronto and those following online.</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:52.940" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s not very often that you see a country&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">largest theater packed for an intellectual debate.</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.960" end="00:08:59.880" style="s2">But that&#39;s what we&#39;re all here for tonight.</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.200" end="00:09:01.580" style="s2">Please join me</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">Please join me in welcoming to the stage</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.660" style="s2">Dr. Slavoj Žižek and Dr. Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.040" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">Just a few words of introduction.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.520" end="00:09:48.500" style="s2">There can be few things I think now more urgent and necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:55.480" style="s2">in an age of reactionary, partisan allegiance and degraded civil discourse,</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.040" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">than real thinking about hard questions.</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.700" end="00:10:06.060" style="s2">The very premise of tonight&#39;s event is that we all participate</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.440" end="00:10:09.020" style="s2">in the life of thought,</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.220" end="00:10:12.760" style="s2">not merely opinion or prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.500" end="00:10:19.620" style="s2">but the realm of truth, accessed through evidence and argument.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.900" end="00:10:27.480" style="s2">But these two towering figures of different disciplines and domains</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.040" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">share more than a commitment to thinking itself.</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.800" end="00:10:40.260" style="s2">They are both highly tuned to ideology and the mechanisms of power.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:46.300" style="s2">And yet, they are not principally political thinkers.</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.140" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">They are both concerned with more fundamental matters: meaning, truth, freedom.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:59.320" style="s2">So it seems to me likely that we will see tonight not only deep differences,</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.320" end="00:11:04.260" style="s2">but also surprising agreement on deep questions.</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.380" end="00:11:11.820" style="s2">Dr. Slavoj Žižek is a philosopher. He has not one but two doctoral degrees,</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.180" end="00:11:14.180" style="s2">one in philosophy,</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.800" end="00:11:24.760" style="s2">one in philosophy from the University of Ljubljana,</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.960" end="00:11:28.100" style="s2">and a second in psychoanalysis from University --</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.340" end="00:11:30.340" style="s2">[crowd cheering]</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.580" end="00:11:35.580" style="s2">Let&#39;s hear it for psychoanalysis!</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.900" end="00:11:37.900" style="s2">From the University of Paris VIII.</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.900" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">He is now a professor at the Institute of Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:49.740" style="s2">and the director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London.</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.120" end="00:11:54.060" style="s2">He has published more than three dozen books,</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.060" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">many on the most seminal philosophers of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.820" end="00:12:04.520" style="s2">He is a dazzling theorist with extraordinary range,</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.520" end="00:12:06.820" style="s2">a global figure for decades,</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.980" end="00:12:11.860" style="s2">he turns again and again with dialectical power to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.060" end="00:12:18.300" style="s2">radical questions of emancipation, subjectivity, and art.</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.100" end="00:12:25.020" style="s2">[crowd cheering]</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.140" end="00:12:32.700" style="s2">[crowd laughing]</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.140" end="00:12:40.180" style="s2">Dr. Jordan Peterson is an academic and clinical --</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.180" end="00:12:44.400" style="s2">[crowd cheering]</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.220" end="00:12:49.500" style="s2">an academic and clinical psychologist.</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.780" end="00:12:53.700" style="s2">His doctorate was awarded by McGill University and he was subsequently</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.060" end="00:12:56.060" style="s2">[crowd cheering]</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:12:57.780" style="s2">[laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.900" end="00:13:01.460" style="s2">We&#39;ve got some McGill graduates out here.</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.780" end="00:13:05.520" style="s2">He was subsequently professor of psychology at Harvard University</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.520" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">and then the University of Toronto where he is today.</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.020" end="00:13:12.020" style="s2">[cheering]</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.400" end="00:13:17.580" style="s2">The author of two books and well over a hundred academic articles,</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.580" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">Dr. Peterson&#39;s intellectual roots likewise lie in the 19th and early 20th centuries,</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.420" end="00:13:30.940" style="s2">where his reading of Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, and above all Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.940" end="00:13:37.560" style="s2">inform his interpretation of ancient myths, of 20th century totalitarianism,</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.780" end="00:13:42.340" style="s2">and especially his endeavor to counter contemporary nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:50.420" style="s2">His &quot;12 Rules for Life&quot; is a global bestseller, and his lectures and podcasts are followed by millions around the world.</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.660" end="00:13:57.840" style="s2">[cheering and applause]</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.520" end="00:14:08.080" style="s2">Both Dr. Žižek and Peterson transcend their titles, their disciplines, and the academy.</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.540" end="00:14:13.980" style="s2">Just as this debate, we hope, will transcend purely economic questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.300" end="00:14:17.980" style="s2">by situating those in the frame of happiness --</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.300" end="00:14:21.500" style="s2">of human flourishing itself.</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.080" end="00:14:24.080" style="s2">We&#39;re in for quite a night.</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.740" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">A quick word about format:</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:33.300" style="s2">each of our debaters will have 30 minutes to make a substantial opening statement,</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:35.400" style="s2">to lay out an argument.</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.400" end="00:14:39.240" style="s2">Dr. Peterson first followed by Dr. Žižek.</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.860" end="00:14:44.500" style="s2">Each will then have, in the same order, 10 minutes to reply.</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:50.380" style="s2">I will then moderate 45 minutes or so of questions, many of which</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.580" end="00:14:55.960" style="s2">will come from you, the audience, both here in Toronto and online.</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.580" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">With that, let&#39;s get underway.</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:03.860" style="s2">Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jordan Peterson for the first opening statement.</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">[applause]</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.420" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">Well, thank you for that insanely enthusiastic welcome,</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:23.260" style="s2">for the entire event and also for being here.</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.500" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">I have to tell you first that this event,</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:30.300" style="s2">and I suppose my life in some sense,</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.300" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">hit a new milestone that I was just made aware of by a stagehand today backstage</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:40.520" style="s2">who informed me that last week, the tickets for this event</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.840" end="00:15:44.060" style="s2">were being scalped online at a higher price</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.300" end="00:15:46.620" style="s2">than the tickets for the Leaf&#39;s playoff games.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:48.300" style="s2">[cheering]</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.300" end="00:15:50.900" style="s2">[Peterson laughing]</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.420" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">So I dunno what to make of that.</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.740" end="00:16:02.120" style="s2">Alright. So. How did I prepare for this?</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.360" end="00:16:03.380" style="s2">Uhm.</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.380" end="00:16:07.840" style="s2">I went -- I familiarized myself to the degree that it was possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.880" end="00:16:09.720" style="s2">with Slavoj Žižek&#39;s work,</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.800" end="00:16:14.280" style="s2">and that wasn&#39;t that possible because he has a lot of work and he&#39;s a very original thinker</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.280" end="00:16:17.200" style="s2">and this debate was put together in relatively short order.</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.200" end="00:16:23.800" style="s2">And what I did instead was return to what I regarded as the original cause of all the trouble, let&#39;s say,</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.800" end="00:16:25.800" style="s2">which was the Communist Manifesto,</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.800" end="00:16:26.500" style="s2">[audience laughing]</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.620" end="00:16:28.620" style="s2">-- and what I attempted to do --</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.620" end="00:16:32.460" style="s2">because that&#39;s Marx, and we&#39;re here to talk about Marxism, let&#39;s say,</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.860" end="00:16:34.340" style="s2">and, umm...</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.440" end="00:16:37.060" style="s2">What I tried to do was read it,</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.260" end="00:16:43.180" style="s2">and to read something you don&#39;t just follow the words and follow the meaning,</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.180" end="00:16:47.620" style="s2">but you take apart the sentences and you ask yourself,</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.880" end="00:16:52.060" style="s2">at this level of phrase and at the level of sentence and at the level of paragraph,</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.060" end="00:16:58.960" style="s2">&quot;Is this true? Are there counterarguments that can be put forward that are credible?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.200" end="00:17:01.580" style="s2">&quot;Is this solid thinking?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.860" end="00:17:06.600" style="s2">And I have to tell you, and I&#39;m not trying to be flippant here,</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.900" end="00:17:09.260" style="s2">that I have rarely read a tract</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.260" end="00:17:13.780" style="s2">-- now I read it when I was 18, it was a long time ago. That&#39;s 40 years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.780" end="00:17:18.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve rarely read a tract that made as many errors per sentence --</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.560" end="00:17:21.220" style="s2">conceptual errors per sentence as the Communist Manifesto.</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:24.020" style="s2">It was quite a miraculous re-read.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.020" end="00:17:27.840" style="s2">And it was interesting to think about it psychologically as well because</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.840" end="00:17:33.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve read student papers that were of the same ilk, in some sense,</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:40.360" style="s2">although I&#39;m not suggesting that they were of the same level of glittering literary brilliance and polemic quality.</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:46.620" style="s2">And I also understand that the Communist Manifesto was a call for revolution and not a standard logical argument.</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.620" end="00:17:51.580" style="s2">But that notwithstanding, I have some things to say about that author&#39;s psychologically.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.580" end="00:17:55.960" style="s2">The first thing is that it doesn&#39;t seem to me that either Marx or Engels</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.220" end="00:17:59.920" style="s2">grappled with one fundamental -- with this particular fundamental truth</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.920" end="00:18:04.620" style="s2">which is that almost all ideas are wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.620" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">And so, if you --</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re your ideas or someone else&#39;s ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.200" end="00:18:12.200" style="s2">they&#39;re probably wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.200" end="00:18:14.200" style="s2">and even if they strike you with the force of brilliance</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.200" end="00:18:17.460" style="s2">your job is to assume, first of all, that they&#39;re probably wrong,</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.700" end="00:18:21.680" style="s2">and then to assault them with everything you have in your arsenal</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">and see if they can survive.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.020" end="00:18:27.920" style="s2">And what struck me about the Communist Manifesto was, it was akin to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.060" end="00:18:30.060" style="s2">something Jung said about</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.060" end="00:18:33.740" style="s2">typical thinking, and this was the thinking of people who weren&#39;t trained to think.</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.740" end="00:18:40.660" style="s2">He said that the typical thinker has a thought, it appears to them like an object might appear in a room,</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.900" end="00:18:45.460" style="s2">the thought appears, and then they just accept it as true.</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.720" end="00:18:51.000" style="s2">They don&#39;t go the second step, which is to think about the thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.160" end="00:18:53.580" style="s2">And that&#39;s the real essence of critical thinking,</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:18:56.200" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what you try and teach people in university,</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.420" end="00:18:58.780" style="s2">is to read a text and to think about it critically</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.100" end="00:19:04.740" style="s2">-- not to destroy the utility of the text, but to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:10.340" style="s2">And so what I tried to do when I was reading the Communist Manifest was to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.340" end="00:19:14.560" style="s2">And I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve found some wheat, yes, but mostly chaff.</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.560" end="00:19:16.600" style="s2">And I&#39;m going to explain why,</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.760" end="00:19:18.140" style="s2">umm, hopefully, uhh,</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.460" end="00:19:19.820" style="s2">in relatively short order.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.820" end="00:19:26.540" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to outline 10 of the fundamental axioms of the Communist Manifesto.</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.540" end="00:19:31.980" style="s2">And so these are truths that are basically held as self-evident by the authors.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.980" end="00:19:37.920" style="s2">They&#39;re truths that are presented in some sense as unquestioned, and I&#39;m going to question them</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.920" end="00:19:42.180" style="s2">and tell you why I think they&#39;re unreliable.</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.180" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">Now, we should remember that this tract was actually written 170 years ago --</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:48.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a long time ago!</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.660" end="00:19:52.800" style="s2">And we have learned a fair bit since then about human nature,</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.000" end="00:19:55.500" style="s2">about society, about politics, about economics.</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.820" end="00:19:59.340" style="s2">There&#39;s lots of mysteries left to be solved,</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.560" end="00:20:04.020" style="s2">but we are slightly wiser, I presume, than we were at one point and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.220" end="00:20:07.100" style="s2">you can forgive the authors to some degree for what they didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.300" end="00:20:12.800" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t matter given that the essence of this doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.000" end="00:20:16.980" style="s2">is still held as sacrosanct by a large proportion of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.120" end="00:20:18.780" style="s2">academics.</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.260" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">Probably.</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:24.440" style="s2">Are among the most -- what would you call? --</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.500" end="00:20:28.220" style="s2">guilty of that particular sin.</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.220" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">So, here&#39;s proposition number one:</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.160" end="00:20:36.100" style="s2">1. History is to be viewed primarily as an economic class struggle.</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.040" end="00:20:40.560" style="s2">Alright, so let&#39;s think about that for a minute.</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.400" end="00:20:47.320" style="s2">First of all, the proposition there is that history is primarily to be viewed through an economic lens,</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.400" end="00:20:50.660" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s a debatable proposition because</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.440" style="s2">there are many other motivations that drive human beings than economics</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.780" end="00:20:56.780" style="s2">and those have to be taken into account.</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.780" end="00:21:03.140" style="s2">Especially that drive people other than economic competition, like economic cooperation, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.380" end="00:21:05.380" style="s2">And so, that&#39;s a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.380" end="00:21:13.400" style="s2">The other problem is that it&#39;s not nearly a pessimistic enough description of the actual problem because history</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.820" end="00:21:18.740" style="s2">history, this is to give the devil his due,</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.680" end="00:21:27.720" style="s2">The idea that one of the driving forces between history is hierarchical struggle is absolutely true.</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.740" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">But the idea that that&#39;s actually history is not true, because it&#39;s deeper than history,</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.420" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">it&#39;s biology itself because organisms of all sorts organize themselves into hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:46.180" style="s2">And one of the problems with hierarchies is that they tend to arrange themselves into a winner-take-all situation</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">and so,</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">and that is implicit in some sense in Marxist thinking because, of course,</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.960" end="00:21:56.820" style="s2">Marx believed that in a capitalist society capital would accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people.</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.100" end="00:22:00.840" style="s2">And that actually is in keeping with the nature of hierarchical organizations.</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.260" end="00:22:06.620" style="s2">Now, the problem with that isn&#39;t so much the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.380" end="00:22:15.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s accuracy in the accusation that that is a eternal form of motivation for struggle</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.240" end="00:22:18.380" style="s2">but it&#39;s an underestimation of the seriousness of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.540" end="00:22:23.820" style="s2">because it attributes it to the structure of human societies rather than the deeper reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.120" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">of the existence of hierarchical structures per se,</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.160" end="00:22:33.180" style="s2">which as they also characterize the animal kingdom to a large degree are clearly not only human constructions.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.620" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">And the idea that there&#39;s hierarchical cometeition among human beings,</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.260" end="00:22:42.580" style="s2">there&#39;s evidence for that that goes back at least to the Paleolithic times.</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.580" end="00:22:45.880" style="s2">And so that&#39;s the next problem, it&#39;s that, well,</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.140" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">this ancient problem of hierarchical structure is clearly not attributable to capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:59.060" style="s2">because it existed long in human history before capitalism existed</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.240" end="00:23:02.280" style="s2">and then it predated human history itself.</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.280" end="00:23:07.240" style="s2">So the question then arises, why would you necessarily, at least implicitly,</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:11.740" style="s2">link the class struggle with capitalism given that it&#39;s a far deeper problem?</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.740" end="00:23:15.900" style="s2">And now, it&#39;s also, you&#39;ve gotta understand that this is a deeper problem for people on the left,</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.960" end="00:23:17.460" style="s2">not just for people on the right.</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.680" end="00:23:22.120" style="s2">It is the case that hierarchical structures dispossess those people who are at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.520" end="00:23:25.380" style="s2">those creatures who are at the bottom, speaking, say of animals.</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.380" end="00:23:29.900" style="s2">-- but those people who are at the bottom, and that is a fundamental existential problem.</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:33.340" style="s2">But the other thing that Marx didn&#39;t seem to take into account is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:40.020" style="s2">there are far more reasons that human beings struggle than their economic class struggle</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.020" end="00:23:45.940" style="s2">even if you build the hierarchical idea into that, which is a more comprehensive way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.280" end="00:23:50.800" style="s2">Human beings struggle with themselves, with the malevolence that&#39;s inside themselves,</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.800" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">with the evil that they&#39;re capable of doing, with the spiritual and psychological warfare that goes on within them,</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re also actually always at odds with nature, and this never seems to show up in Marx.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:08.380" style="s2">And it doesn&#39;t show up in Marxism in general. It&#39;s as if nature doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.380" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">The primary conflict, as far as I&#39;m concerned, or a primary conflict</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.520" end="00:24:19.320" style="s2">that human beings engage in is the struggle for life in a cruel and harsh natural world.</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.320" end="00:24:24.060" style="s2">And it&#39;s as if that doesn&#39;t exist in the Marxist domain.</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.060" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">&quot;If human beings have a problem it&#39;s because there&#39;s a class struggle, it&#39;s essentially economic&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:29.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like, no!</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.820" end="00:24:34.760" style="s2">Human beings have problems because we come into the life starving and lonesome</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.000" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">and we have to solve that problem continually,</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.480" end="00:24:41.140" style="s2">and we make our social arrangements, at least in part, to ameliorate that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.140" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">As well as to, well, upon occasion exacerbate it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:49.700" style="s2">And so there&#39;s also very little understanding in the Communist Manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.880" end="00:24:56.860" style="s2">that any of the hierarchical organizations that human beings have put together might have a positive element.</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.860" end="00:25:03.880" style="s2">And that&#39;s an absolute catastrophe because hierarchical structures are actually necessary to solve complicated social problems,</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.980" end="00:25:05.980" style="s2">we have to organize ourselves in some manner,</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.980" end="00:25:11.480" style="s2">and you have to give the devil his due, and so it is the case that hierarchies dispossess people</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.480" end="00:25:15.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s a big problem. That&#39;s the fundamental problem of inequality.</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.140" end="00:25:19.700" style="s2">But it&#39;s also the case that hierarchies happen to be a very efficient way of distributing resources</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.820" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s finally the case that human hierarchies are not fundamentally predicated on power.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.500" end="00:25:31.680" style="s2">And I would say the biological/anthropological data on that are crystal clear.</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.800" end="00:25:39.860" style="s2">You don&#39;t rise to a position of authority that&#39;s reliable in a human society primarily by exploiting other people.</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.860" end="00:25:42.900" style="s2">It&#39;s a very unstable means of obtaining power, so --</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.900" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">[audience jeering]</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">Well, the people who laugh might do it that way.</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:56.280" style="s2">[laughter, applause]</p>
