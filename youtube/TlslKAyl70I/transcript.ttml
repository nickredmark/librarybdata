<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">ontology yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.990" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">I skipped all the small talk stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:23.670" style="s2">even deep that would like an almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:25.560" style="s2">French accent of ontology the moment it</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.670" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">happens to me I have ontology yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.560" end="00:00:31.289" style="s2">don&#39;t mind that all your Canadian your</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">excuse of ontology is the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.289" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">Normandy ology so when it comes to doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">history and doing religion you you</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">obviously have a fundamental story this</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:47.879" style="s2">is a story circular time so if you say</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:49.829" style="s2">Mircea Eliade of the great</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">anthropologist in the 20th century they</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">do it alright about circular times the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">fundamental time that you being</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">suffering according to so you know every</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">new year there&#39;ll be a new world so</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">every year is the same so everything is</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">repeated constantly this is called</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">circular time and it&#39;s actually how time</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">was understood for hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">of years by you being so there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:16.500" style="s2">really no reason for us to look at time</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">differently from that and this ties in</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.500" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">with what we talked about before you</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">know which is no mythology can is one</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">thing came to my mind does that have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">anything to do with eternal return</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">yes exactly there&#39;s even a Elliot book</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">called the myth of the eternal return we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">also know this expression from Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">of course all right the eternal return</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">means that everything returns to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">same place and then it just repeats</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">itself and this comes from the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">religion where every human behavior was</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">seen as some kind of imitation of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:50.220" style="s2">gods like every actor we do a God would</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:53.729" style="s2">have done first</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.220" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">when elderly or your parents and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.729" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">eventually you and and this of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">ties in with biology and how children</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:02.460" style="s2">are pre-programmed to imitate and mimic</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.869" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">their parents and of course all your</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.460" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">beings when we call the times sure are</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">but um Missy Elliott writes about this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:12.490" style="s2">like the myth of the eternal return is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:15.130" style="s2">fundamental to human beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.490" end="00:02:17.620" style="s2">this is numerology because the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.130" end="00:02:19.810" style="s2">nammed ology being the teaching of human</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.620" end="00:02:23.140" style="s2">beings as creature constantly on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.810" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">move means that the nomadic tribe the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.140" end="00:02:26.800" style="s2">sociologists we call it no work</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:30.190" style="s2">this original nomadic tribe it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.800" end="00:02:32.890" style="s2">move all the time but it&#39;s also on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.190" end="00:02:36.460" style="s2">move in a circular way it returns to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.890" end="00:02:37.990" style="s2">same place probably because of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.460" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">nomads we&#39;re moving according to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.990" end="00:02:43.870" style="s2">seasons so this is fundamental circular</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:47.080" style="s2">turn now what happens is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.870" end="00:02:49.600" style="s2">obviously traces of ontology already in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.080" end="00:02:50.950" style="s2">the nomadic tribe especially Seamus</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.600" end="00:02:52.780" style="s2">would practice something that would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.950" end="00:02:55.750" style="s2">similar to ontology there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.780" end="00:02:58.600" style="s2">something in the military so if you were</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.750" end="00:03:01.750" style="s2">involved in hunting or warfare you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.600" end="00:03:05.500" style="s2">involved in an ontology but we would end</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.750" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">the day you die so once you transcend it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.500" end="00:03:11.980" style="s2">and transferred everything onto your</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:13.960" style="s2">your heritage onto your sons and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.980" end="00:03:15.790" style="s2">would all be repeated anyway it&#39;d still</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.960" end="00:03:18.340" style="s2">be within this sort of the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.790" end="00:03:20.110" style="s2">return of the same but what happens we</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.340" end="00:03:22.360" style="s2">start a settle down about ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.110" end="00:03:24.940" style="s2">years ago is that because we don&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.360" end="00:03:28.360" style="s2">any longer we started to move the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.940" end="00:03:31.030" style="s2">of ideas mm-hmm and we can&#39;t call that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.360" end="00:03:33.880" style="s2">nammed ology because once you start them</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.030" end="00:03:35.290" style="s2">over the world of ideas then things do</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.880" end="00:03:36.060" style="s2">not necessarily have to be the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.290" end="00:03:39.790" style="s2">every year</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:41.860" style="s2">so this tie seems especially masculine</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.790" end="00:03:44.170" style="s2">fantasy of the son being different from</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.860" end="00:03:45.550" style="s2">the father and if a loss of always has</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.170" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">written a lot about this issue of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.550" end="00:03:49.420" style="s2">loose his most famous book is called</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:52.660" style="s2">difference repetition deforms one</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.420" end="00:03:54.970" style="s2">tradition from the 1960s it was probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.660" end="00:03:56.110" style="s2">stock truth aces originally but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.970" end="00:03:58.540" style="s2">absolutely brilliant book where</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.110" end="00:04:00.610" style="s2">discusses me just returned returned are</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:02.830" style="s2">the same and that sets misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.610" end="00:04:07.090" style="s2">because what Nietzsche means is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.830" end="00:04:09.940" style="s2">with every loop every term it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.090" end="00:04:12.190" style="s2">slightly different from the last term so</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.940" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a small difference this what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:16.600" style="s2">called difference repetition there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:18.640" style="s2">small difference with every loop in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.600" end="00:04:21.130" style="s2">eternal return and this difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.640" end="00:04:23.090" style="s2">creates the potential for a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.130" end="00:04:25.850" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.090" end="00:04:28.730" style="s2">this is the birth of linear time or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.850" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">phallic time so what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.730" end="00:04:34.430" style="s2">Zoroastrianism which is the first one to</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.430" end="00:04:38.660" style="s2">about three thousand several years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.290" end="00:04:40.820" style="s2">formulas are lead and built on linear</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.660" end="00:04:41.750" style="s2">time alone and saying that cyclical time</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.820" end="00:04:43.669" style="s2">is delusional</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.750" end="00:04:46.010" style="s2">linear time is way more interesting or</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.669" end="00:04:49.970" style="s2">phallic time meaning we can create</p>

<p begin="00:04:49.970" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">that we improve on everything we improve</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.250" end="00:04:56.540" style="s2">on the ideas we improve on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:04:58.669" style="s2">technologies all the time we improve on</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.540" end="00:05:00.470" style="s2">the text we&#39;ve improve on the art we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.669" end="00:05:01.940" style="s2">proven everything we human beings do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.470" end="00:05:04.010" style="s2">get more and more advanced to be more</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:06.410" style="s2">more sophisticated what we do it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.010" end="00:05:08.090" style="s2">we change so astros adamant that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.410" end="00:05:11.060" style="s2">don&#39;t change its our environmental</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.090" end="00:05:13.910" style="s2">changes and we change with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.060" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">so then process is no longer just</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.910" end="00:05:20.120" style="s2">process it becomes process and event and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">the word first is an event yes and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.120" end="00:05:23.180" style="s2">you probably know by now that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:25.130" style="s2">working title then you work in title of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.180" end="00:05:27.050" style="s2">the book you could call the new book</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.130" end="00:05:28.729" style="s2">numerology and of ontology but I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.050" end="00:05:31.220" style="s2">process and then export sounds because</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.729" end="00:05:33.289" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly what it is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.220" end="00:05:35.390" style="s2">so even ecology arrives in history</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.289" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">obviously this is also happened in India</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.390" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">China that there are traces of this of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:41.479" style="s2">course and always some of course a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">Shiley some in India so there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.479" end="00:05:45.560" style="s2">several Indian mystical schools as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:47.650" style="s2">who go into this idea that there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.560" end="00:05:50.600" style="s2">something that leaves the circular time</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.650" end="00:05:52.130" style="s2">the Sun is different from the Father one</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.600" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">loop is different from the last one and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.130" end="00:05:55.789" style="s2">this difference in itself creates the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:58.580" style="s2">possibility of acquainting a better</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.789" end="00:06:00.139" style="s2">world hmm so the dream of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.580" end="00:06:01.789" style="s2">better world arrives and without linear</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.139" end="00:06:04.310" style="s2">time we couldn&#39;t have that dream right</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.789" end="00:06:05.750" style="s2">but the two things are happening aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.310" end="00:06:08.180" style="s2">they that we&#39;re creating a better world</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.750" end="00:06:10.130" style="s2">and we&#39;re also destroying at the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.180" end="00:06:11.210" style="s2">time right there&#39;s a design and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.130" end="00:06:13.400" style="s2">creative process happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.210" end="00:06:15.080" style="s2">simultaneously right well I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.400" end="00:06:17.180" style="s2">we are destroying</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.080" end="00:06:19.100" style="s2">we are obviously living in times that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.180" end="00:06:21.320" style="s2">are convinced that we are not Bach</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.640" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">because Christianity and Islam are just</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.900" end="00:08:23.190" style="s2">right the idea the child of God or one</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:28.530" style="s2">of the same thing and the whole the</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.340" end="00:08:46.020" style="s2">the lesser gods eventually so so this</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.800" end="00:08:48.120" style="s2">whole chain of transcendence is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.020" end="00:08:48.510" style="s2">human beings were foster to live within</p>

<p begin="00:08:53.430" end="00:08:56.430" style="s2">difference between child and God at all</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.990" end="00:08:57.660" style="s2">it&#39;s not only there&#39;s no difference in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.430" end="00:09:00.390" style="s2">man and God but such interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.660" end="00:09:02.010" style="s2">childhood God mm-hmm and this exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.390" end="00:09:05.520" style="s2">saw in Christianity running told the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.010" end="00:09:08.910" style="s2">problems that they did they&#39;re agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.520" end="00:09:11.130" style="s2">religions and Gnosticism is to began in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.910" end="00:09:14.070" style="s2">here so going back to surrealism in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.130" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">surrealism you cannot separate body and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.070" end="00:09:19.020" style="s2">mind but rather you use separate child</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:21.000" style="s2">and grown-up and you separate grown-up</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.020" end="00:09:22.830" style="s2">and elder he a separate elder and priest</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.000" end="00:09:23.250" style="s2">or say to you separately since age from</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.250" end="00:09:27.240" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a whole chain here of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">reporting you could call it a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.240" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very very important to stay with</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:34.170" style="s2">now the beauty of man and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:36.450" style="s2">reason why so a stem is the first</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.530" end="00:13:40.910" style="s2">the streets downs little just people</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.410" end="00:13:43.520" style="s2">will worship the different local gods</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.910" end="00:13:46.610" style="s2">they had goddesses and gods and these</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.610" end="00:13:51.590" style="s2">with it le odd and gerard of discussing</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.650" end="00:13:54.050" style="s2">when they reflected an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.590" end="00:13:55.940" style="s2">the world where the gods would guide you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.050" end="00:13:57.980" style="s2">and speak for you and help you and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.940" end="00:14:01.610" style="s2">support your whatever you did and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.980" end="00:14:03.470" style="s2">had something to mimic mm-hmm yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.610" end="00:14:04.730" style="s2">think for people to mimic something they</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.470" end="00:14:07.640" style="s2">have to have a directly a ship without</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.730" end="00:14:09.170" style="s2">God yeah if that&#39;s one of the lesser</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.640" end="00:14:11.480" style="s2">gods you should know my knowledge is all</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.170" end="00:14:13.460" style="s2">about also you mimic you mimic the gods</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.480" end="00:14:16.220" style="s2">when you&#39;re younger right in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.460" end="00:14:18.080" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll see your mimic your parents</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.220" end="00:14:19.520" style="s2">your parents then mimic the priests and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.080" end="00:14:22.490" style="s2">the sages and the priests and say just</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.520" end="00:14:24.380" style="s2">mimic the gods meaning when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.490" end="00:14:27.320" style="s2">mimicking a lesser God you&#39;re mimicking</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.380" end="00:14:29.390" style="s2">a priest or a sage who has passed on who</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.320" end="00:14:31.190" style="s2">is above you somewhere else but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.390" end="00:14:32.840" style="s2">the equivalent of mimicking a priest and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.190" end="00:14:34.670" style="s2">a sage that means you go to the lesser</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.840" end="00:14:36.620" style="s2">God you go to the Ganesh&#39;s of the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.670" end="00:14:38.090" style="s2">you go to the oldest process of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.620" end="00:14:39.650" style="s2">world yeah well that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.090" end="00:14:42.890" style="s2">thinking that younger people usually</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.650" end="00:14:44.090" style="s2">idolize you know these lesser gods that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.890" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">you&#39;re talking people in their Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.090" end="00:14:48.770" style="s2">right won&#39;t you get to be in your 30s or</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:51.230" style="s2">40s you don&#39;t give a shit so what about</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.770" end="00:14:55.730" style="s2">the lesser gods but well you still do</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.230" end="00:14:57.320" style="s2">twenties yeah but you still you still do</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.730" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">but you&#39;re more ignorant of it or you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.320" end="00:15:02.120" style="s2">worship Buddha or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:03.740" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s I mean this is why we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.120" end="00:15:06.440" style="s2">had Buddha and Muhammad in Jesus and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.740" end="00:15:07.910" style="s2">most of these guys to be humans so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.440" end="00:15:09.290" style="s2">had these go-betweens</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.910" end="00:15:10.730" style="s2">they were also worse than with lesser</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.290" end="00:15:15.190" style="s2">cause you&#39;re not supposed to worship</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.730" end="00:15:17.630" style="s2">Muhammad is a god but you do anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.190" end="00:15:19.370" style="s2">the lesser gods are in front of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.630" end="00:15:22.640" style="s2">important obviously the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.370" end="00:15:25.850" style="s2">figure this out quite early and and turn</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:27.710" style="s2">them into Saints mm-hmm so their idols</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.850" end="00:15:29.480" style="s2">and icons did you turn to me to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.710" end="00:15:32.060" style="s2">we call we&#39;re gonna call this I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.480" end="00:15:34.580" style="s2">chronology in our work to separate from</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.060" end="00:15:36.350" style="s2">politics because policies amis is way</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.580" end="00:15:37.910" style="s2">more than that it&#39;s also the worship of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.350" end="00:15:39.710" style="s2">celebrities and stars and things like</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.910" end="00:15:43.190" style="s2">that but it&#39;s better than to colleges</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.710" end="00:15:45.080" style="s2">iconology so what is an icon ology who</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.190" end="00:15:46.790" style="s2">do you look up to as a role model you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.080" end="00:15:50.120" style="s2">a grown-up and who do you try to mimic</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.790" end="00:15:52.340" style="s2">and become like you know who&#39;s your role</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.120" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">model who do you train according to its</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.340" end="00:15:57.470" style="s2">called Sutra in Buddhism and Hinduism so</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">you&#39;re going to Sutra mode which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.470" end="00:16:01.880" style="s2">who&#39;s your role mode and how can you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:05.510" style="s2">make that as perfectly as possible yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.880" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">and obviously do teacher teachers also</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.510" end="00:16:10.370" style="s2">who are sort of the teacher as a friend</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:11.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same thing as the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.370" end="00:16:13.310" style="s2">level of Audrianna where the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.750" end="00:16:15.500" style="s2">becomes sort of a transmitter of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.310" end="00:16:17.420" style="s2">something else but on them on on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.500" end="00:16:20.840" style="s2">sushi on a level the teacher is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.420" end="00:16:22.940" style="s2">like a role model friend yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.840" end="00:16:24.470" style="s2">watch Rihanna the teacher is something</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.940" end="00:16:27.850" style="s2">quite different than the role model</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.470" end="00:16:30.590" style="s2">friend it&#39;s a different level of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.850" end="00:16:33.170" style="s2">transmission what we human beings need</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.590" end="00:16:34.460" style="s2">somebody to look up to the way chosen</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.170" end="00:16:36.710" style="s2">look up to their parents</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.460" end="00:16:38.090" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s what we need all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.710" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">time because we mimic</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.090" end="00:16:42.380" style="s2">we make all the time that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:46.640" style="s2">learn things we have to look up you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.380" end="00:16:49.250" style="s2">to be oh yes looking down and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.640" end="00:16:51.110" style="s2">what Saints and lesser gods are for and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.250" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">it&#39;s called iconology and we must</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.110" end="00:16:55.490" style="s2">understand that this is fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:57.170" style="s2">human beings into religion and if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.490" end="00:16:58.970" style="s2">remove that like with donning our</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.170" end="00:17:00.950" style="s2">contemporary society then we get rock</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.970" end="00:17:03.050" style="s2">stars and sports stars and other idols</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.950" end="00:17:05.180" style="s2">and because they failed submissively and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.050" end="00:17:07.070" style="s2">they&#39;re not really worth copying then we</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.180" end="00:17:10.010" style="s2">all end up in misery like we have now</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.070" end="00:17:12.290" style="s2">after 1945 mediocrity and the standard</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.010" end="00:17:14.150" style="s2">for human behavior and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.290" end="00:17:16.220" style="s2">don&#39;t ask why do you mimic these guys we</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.150" end="00:17:18.170" style="s2">just mimic Lee because we&#39;re programmed</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.220" end="00:17:21.950" style="s2">to find somebody to look up to mimic and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.170" end="00:17:23.630" style="s2">when when they failed at their lives we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.950" end="00:17:25.700" style="s2">have this sort of misery we have right</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.630" end="00:17:28.190" style="s2">now we can explain that misery because</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.700" end="00:17:29.630" style="s2">these various because we have nobody to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.190" end="00:17:31.970" style="s2">look up to that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.630" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve noticed that in my classes</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.970" end="00:17:37.430" style="s2">teaching the students don&#39;t don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:39.290" style="s2">you know they have kind of unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.430" end="00:17:41.230" style="s2">role models as you say but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.290" end="00:17:44.630" style="s2">have really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.230" end="00:17:45.920" style="s2">people to look up to yeah I mean at</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.630" end="00:17:47.180" style="s2">least youtubers are better the rock</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.920" end="00:17:48.890" style="s2">stars in that department because</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.180" end="00:17:50.630" style="s2">actually talk to them you listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.890" end="00:17:52.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s better so you can although</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.630" end="00:17:54.860" style="s2">responsible for their actions but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.820" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">say at least we understand more what</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.860" end="00:17:59.150" style="s2">iconology is we understand how important</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:01.010" style="s2">it is we understand that it&#39;s tied into</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.150" end="00:18:02.990" style="s2">Normandy ology he started something</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.010" end="00:18:06.200" style="s2">fundamentally human and it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.990" end="00:18:07.820" style="s2">circular time it&#39;s magical and if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.200" end="00:18:09.890" style="s2">really want to start it and understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.820" end="00:18:13.550" style="s2">it fully we should study Hinduism right</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.890" end="00:18:15.590" style="s2">so but so asterism keeps this the only</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.550" end="00:18:17.690" style="s2">thing so a schism does as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.590" end="00:18:21.680" style="s2">Hinduism is that it switches the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.690" end="00:18:25.550" style="s2">emphases from Normandy ology to ontology</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.550" end="00:18:28.790" style="s2">priority becomes the phonic that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.890" end="00:18:31.970" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.790" end="00:18:34.100" style="s2">so Aston is the only phallic modest</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.970" end="00:18:36.710" style="s2">religion and what I mean with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.100" end="00:18:38.450" style="s2">phallic monism is that it&#39;s modest in</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.710" end="00:18:39.740" style="s2">the sense the universe is one and</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.280" end="00:18:51.020" style="s2">unthinkable to be dualist in the East</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.350" end="00:18:52.430" style="s2">all the older major leaders of the East</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.020" end="00:18:54.020" style="s2">are modest and that&#39;s exactly where the</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.020" end="00:18:57.860" style="s2">because we need to get rid of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.030" end="00:18:59.510" style="s2">Gnostic character just useless these</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.860" end="00:19:01.370" style="s2">days because you need to go back to the</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.680" end="00:19:08.360" style="s2">does is that it shifts to the phallic</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.980" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">Taoism tries to keep the balance between</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.360" end="00:19:13.720" style="s2">the two as young as you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:16.220" style="s2">whereas hindusim stays with again more</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.720" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">this case tastes the magical and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.220" end="00:19:20.900" style="s2">Hinduism wisely in a way says that no no</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.830" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">the phallic is for the military the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.900" end="00:19:24.830" style="s2">phallic is for the Yogi&#39;s let&#39;s keep the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.390" style="s2">phallic out of the mainstream and let</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.830" end="00:19:28.760" style="s2">people go and worship their Ganesha&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.390" end="00:19:30.800" style="s2">much as they much whereas the Yogi&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:30.800" end="00:19:36.620" style="s2">hmm yeah or the manifestation of Brahmin</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.030" end="00:19:41.420" style="s2">inside isn&#39;t that would be Sheela which</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.620" end="00:19:43.430" style="s2">is phallus so so they what I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.420" end="00:19:44.690" style="s2">argued ever since I started studying so</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.430" end="00:19:47.270" style="s2">as soon as in the nineteen eighties was</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.690" end="00:19:49.610" style="s2">that was completely misunderstood it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.270" end="00:19:52.130" style="s2">interpreted by Westerners as a precursor</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.610" end="00:19:54.350" style="s2">to Christianity Islam when every outdoor</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.130" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">Astor&#39;s it was an Arian into your</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.350" end="00:19:59.690" style="s2">in religion it&#39;s a so-called religion</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:20:02.210" style="s2">it&#39;s tantric it&#39;s monist it&#39;s closely</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.690" end="00:20:04.370" style="s2">related taoism buddhism and hinduism and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.210" end="00:20:06.530" style="s2">i&#39;m finally winning this because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.370" end="00:20:09.049" style="s2">a whole new generation of special</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.530" end="00:20:10.490" style="s2">Iranian American scholars who totally</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.049" end="00:20:12.230" style="s2">agree with me who gone back to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.490" end="00:20:14.840" style="s2">original texts read them in the original</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.230" end="00:20:16.160" style="s2">officer language compared to Sanskrit in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.840" end="00:20:18.410" style="s2">India and discovered all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.160" end="00:20:21.429" style="s2">similarities and the only shift you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.410" end="00:20:23.929" style="s2">in cerasus or asked this Reformation</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.429" end="00:20:26.179" style="s2">1,700 before Christ that enables the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.929" end="00:20:29.230" style="s2">Persian Empire to prosper for the next</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.179" end="00:20:33.110" style="s2">fourteen hundred years that revolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.230" end="00:20:36.110" style="s2">was started by shift from Norman ology</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.110" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">to event ology but the cerasus never</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.110" end="00:20:40.520" style="s2">forgot about circular time and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:43.309" style="s2">ignored in Norton or mythology and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.520" end="00:20:45.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t wipe out polytheism they kept it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.309" end="00:20:47.480" style="s2">as a popular folk religion and totally</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.140" end="00:20:49.820" style="s2">accepted it which then later Catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.480" end="00:20:51.350" style="s2">had to imitate to save itself right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.820" end="00:20:53.960" style="s2">that&#39;s like I was just thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.350" end="00:20:56.750" style="s2">the sickness of the West in a way is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.960" end="00:20:58.010" style="s2">this cutting off of polytheism and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.750" end="00:20:59.900" style="s2">having it be repressed</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.010" end="00:21:04.549" style="s2">having been repressed and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.900" end="00:21:06.909" style="s2">manifest itself as pop stars and rather</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.549" end="00:21:09.620" style="s2">than having it being taken seriously</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.909" end="00:21:13.220" style="s2">well it&#39;s kind of if you mix sutra and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.620" end="00:21:16.250" style="s2">tantra you kill both wouldn&#39;t you agree</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.220" end="00:21:19.190" style="s2">with that you got to keep Sutra Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.250" end="00:21:21.650" style="s2">separate understand them separately mmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.190" end="00:21:24.500" style="s2">because our sutures a foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.650" end="00:21:26.270" style="s2">Tantra so even even if it is no my</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.500" end="00:21:29.299" style="s2">knowledge is a foundation of an ontology</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.270" end="00:21:32.390" style="s2">ok matriarchy is the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.299" end="00:21:33.860" style="s2">patriarchy mm-hmm sure circular time is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.390" end="00:21:37.370" style="s2">the foundation before we can have a dare</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.860" end="00:21:39.740" style="s2">to think linear time slow we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.370" end="00:21:41.150" style="s2">start there yeah so North the real</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.740" end="00:21:42.650" style="s2">understanding religion so it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.150" end="00:21:45.799" style="s2">because they settled down that we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.650" end="00:21:47.750" style="s2">start to imagine that what was</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.799" end="00:21:49.820" style="s2">previously something the Mystics don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.750" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2">would the shaman&#39;s don&#39;t would and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.820" end="00:21:52.809" style="s2">possibly could be an idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:56.150" style="s2">military or the priests could deal with</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.809" end="00:21:57.500" style="s2">southern are we settle down this becomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.150" end="00:22:00.770" style="s2">the dominant mode who can actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.500" end="00:22:02.929" style="s2">aspire to and what this does is that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.770" end="00:22:04.850" style="s2">creates the first theory of empire it</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.929" end="00:22:07.830" style="s2">creates the idea that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.850" end="00:22:09.960" style="s2">several different peoples so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.830" end="00:22:12.090" style="s2">different you know clients and tribes</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.960" end="00:22:15.000" style="s2">even nations living together under one</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.090" end="00:22:18.659" style="s2">roof mm-hmm that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.000" end="00:22:20.490" style="s2">unthinkable unless you had presented of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.659" end="00:22:22.950" style="s2">ontology as a superior theory to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.490" end="00:22:24.899" style="s2">mythology like okay we don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.950" end="00:22:27.240" style="s2">already so far in history we&#39;ll keep it</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.899" end="00:22:29.130" style="s2">as a popular engine but it when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.240" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">to the vision and the strategy of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.130" end="00:22:34.590" style="s2">society as a whole which is an imperial</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:35.789" style="s2">theory the name of that religion would</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.590" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">be an ontology that&#39;s what&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.789" end="00:22:39.240" style="s2">estimates the first religion probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:41.190" style="s2">still the only gene that&#39;s a truly</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.240" end="00:22:43.159" style="s2">Imperial digit that&#39;s also why it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.190" end="00:22:45.450" style="s2">foundation for universal human rights</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.159" end="00:22:48.120" style="s2">and so what the purse is do is that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.450" end="00:22:53.909" style="s2">establish this right I&#39;m just laughing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.120" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">because that&#39;s so against the grain of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.909" end="00:22:58.649" style="s2">how people think these days because</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:23:02.750" style="s2">imperialism is is considered to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.649" end="00:23:05.789" style="s2">great evil right and that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.750" end="00:23:07.620" style="s2">impurity is a beautiful idea but today</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.789" end="00:23:10.590" style="s2">how are we gonna save the damn planet</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.620" end="00:23:12.690" style="s2">unless we go Imperial seriously</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.590" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">well Imperial just means very big and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.690" end="00:23:17.639" style="s2">very great and the greatest possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:19.769" style="s2">well we&#39;ve reached the end of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.639" end="00:23:22.529" style="s2">anyway we reach certain end points in</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.769" end="00:23:24.299" style="s2">history we went to the moon in 1969 it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.529" end="00:23:26.760" style="s2">was a disaster there was nothing there</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.299" end="00:23:28.409" style="s2">because we territorially expanded and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.760" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">killed each other and across the entire</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.409" end="00:23:32.639" style="s2">planet up until that point and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:35.309" style="s2">the second body feels uncomfortable the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.639" end="00:23:37.200" style="s2">territorial expansion after 1969 yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.309" end="00:23:39.690" style="s2">because we realized that oh there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.200" end="00:23:42.450" style="s2">nothing there to go to like Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.690" end="00:23:45.090" style="s2">rooty 1958 what the satellites told us</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.450" end="00:23:47.010" style="s2">was that who you were the planet we</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.090" end="00:23:49.470" style="s2">lived on and there was nothing else for</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.010" end="00:23:51.149" style="s2">us to find his face and that territorial</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.470" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">expansion had come to an end</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.149" end="00:23:57.389" style="s2">mmm-hmm so we really know what&#39;s Erastus</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:59.639" style="s2">revolution did three thousand seven</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.389" end="00:24:02.429" style="s2">years ago is we&#39;re now kicking the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.639" end="00:24:03.720" style="s2">second gear of that revolution the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.429" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">second gear of that revolution is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.720" end="00:24:08.039" style="s2">well now we have no more territory to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:11.309" style="s2">expand into even if it permanent to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.039" end="00:24:12.929" style="s2">settle and colonize because the name for</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.309" end="00:24:14.610" style="s2">being a nomad while you still have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.929" end="00:24:19.450" style="s2">permanent settlement is colonization</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.610" end="00:24:21.670" style="s2">mmm-hmm colonization is continent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.450" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">that means we have nowhere else to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.670" end="00:24:32.410" style="s2">than our ideas we have to go more event</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:34.530" style="s2">illogical not less so a return to pure</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.410" end="00:24:37.810" style="s2">numerology to return to paganism is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.530" end="00:24:41.290" style="s2">absolutely impossible we&#39;ve been forced</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.810" end="00:24:43.960" style="s2">to rethink an ontology and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.290" end="00:24:45.430" style="s2">I&#39;m all for it so Aston Renaissance in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.960" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">the sense that if you go back to the</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.999" end="00:32:15.950" style="s2">in China and the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.190" end="00:32:18.590" style="s2">that statehood is not under religious</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.950" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">jurisdiction that means you could have</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.590" end="00:32:23.869" style="s2">dictators like champagne and at the end</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.179" end="00:32:32.840" style="s2">into two and eventually into three</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.999" end="00:32:36.229" style="s2">originally two three what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.840" end="00:32:37.279" style="s2">well it&#39;s Authority know what the third</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.229" end="00:32:41.599" style="s2">is the matriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.279" end="00:32:43.789" style="s2">oh I see okay okay okay so if you look</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.599" end="00:32:46.309" style="s2">if you look at the rest in religion it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.789" end="00:32:49.940" style="s2">has odor and it has master and then it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.309" end="00:32:51.529" style="s2">has to society community in itself the</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.729" end="00:32:55.849" style="s2">religion aspect of it we don&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.529" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">because it&#39;s a fairly college and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.849" end="00:32:59.299" style="s2">puts you on the move the way so raster</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:33:01.159" style="s2">woman would describe it is that she</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.299" end="00:33:03.529" style="s2">would say that religion in our</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.499" end="00:33:16.279" style="s2">hmm isn&#39;t that ironic interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.509" end="00:33:20.090" style="s2">what you get them is that Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.279" end="00:33:22.909" style="s2">mimics Judaism and mimics Judaism and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.090" end="00:33:24.830" style="s2">tries to go universal and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.909" end="00:33:26.840" style="s2">eventually borrow those from surrounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.830" end="00:33:28.580" style="s2">the understanding if you split God into</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.840" end="00:33:30.710" style="s2">two and eventually to three you get a</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.340" end="00:44:53.160" style="s2">opportunity the idea of equal outcome</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.590" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">but it starts in master now that old</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.160" end="00:44:57.240" style="s2">sounded nice didn&#39;t it I think any</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:59.100" style="s2">Bernie Sanders fan today probably loves</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.100" end="00:45:03.060" style="s2">communist I love these ideas forever the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.320" end="00:45:05.820" style="s2">problem is is that it creates complete</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.060" end="00:45:08.550" style="s2">utter havoc and the Persian Empire</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.820" end="00:45:11.010" style="s2">almost fell apart and finally was</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.010" end="00:45:15.510" style="s2">Kinshasa was the priests now the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.530" end="00:45:17.070" style="s2">generation was the priests we decided to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.510" end="00:45:19.920" style="s2">go after Mao stock and money and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.070" end="00:45:21.630" style="s2">especially went after masters and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:24.360" style="s2">basically massacred the Master kites</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.630" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">knowing that if Gnosticism sentence and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.360" end="00:45:28.500" style="s2">he takes over the Empire the Empire will</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:32.790" style="s2">be over and people will do the fucked up</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.500" end="00:45:34.830" style="s2">hmm so you know back in those days so</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.790" end="00:45:39.420" style="s2">you know so you have the invasion of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.830" end="00:45:41.460" style="s2">Gnostic dualism into Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.420" end="00:45:45.060" style="s2">into Zoroastrian societies well and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.460" end="00:45:47.340" style="s2">then happen was that big Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.060" end="00:45:50.070" style="s2">settled on the arab peninsula and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.340" end="00:45:52.710" style="s2">became Islam Islam&#39;s origin is mastic</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.070" end="00:45:55.320" style="s2">ISM that&#39;s exactly why Islam and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.710" end="00:45:56.190" style="s2">socialism and communism so much in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.320" end="00:45:58.500" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.190" end="00:46:01.590" style="s2">look at the Middle East it switched from</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.500" end="00:46:05.310" style="s2">socialism to Islamism in less than ten</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.590" end="00:46:07.970" style="s2">years why is that so easy because that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.310" end="00:46:10.140" style="s2">because the idea of the umma the only</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.970" end="00:46:12.510" style="s2">Congregational community that works in</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.140" end="00:46:16.770" style="s2">the Arab world the Islamic Ummah is</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.510" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">identical to the socialist commune it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.770" end="00:46:20.100" style="s2">the same idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:23.670" style="s2">well so this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.100" end="00:46:25.710" style="s2">we known ever since that yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.670" end="00:46:27.360" style="s2">political alternative it&#39;s okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.710" end="00:46:30.300" style="s2">have social democracy but if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.360" end="00:46:33.660" style="s2">installed masochism as a dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.300" end="00:46:35.970" style="s2">you get Stalinism mmm yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.660" end="00:46:37.830" style="s2">so I would say that what we inherited</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.970" end="00:46:39.990" style="s2">from the Middle East and Europe is only</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.830" end="00:46:41.550" style="s2">a child of the Middle East Europe has</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.990" end="00:46:43.260" style="s2">ever been mimicking the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.550" end="00:46:44.610" style="s2">Middle East is the birth of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.260" end="00:46:47.610" style="s2">and everything you have constantly lists</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.610" end="00:46:49.590" style="s2">so if we look at these creatures these</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.610" end="00:46:52.020" style="s2">guys at naught and unmask dog and look</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.590" end="00:46:53.700" style="s2">at the dangers of dictatorship and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.020" end="00:46:56.310" style="s2">totalitarianism and authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.700" end="00:47:00.060" style="s2">what we inherited eventually in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.310" end="00:47:01.650" style="s2">starting libros so in the 18th century</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.060" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">and he&#39;s found deceased Avenger led to</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.650" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">the French Revolution of jacobeans that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:10.170" style="s2">later became Marxism but Marx of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:11.610" style="s2">had a different idea that also but he</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.170" end="00:47:13.350" style="s2">was probably a bit naive in what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.610" end="00:47:15.750" style="s2">eventually ended up with was of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.350" end="00:47:18.300" style="s2">Hitler and Stalin and Mao and Pol Pot</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.750" end="00:47:20.250" style="s2">and these dictators are all mimicking it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.300" end="00:47:23.190" style="s2">not on mass sucking different variations</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.250" end="00:47:25.470" style="s2">of so they&#39;re located between these guys</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.190" end="00:47:27.930" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t learned the lesson that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.470" end="00:47:30.060" style="s2">the what religion was meant to do was</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.930" end="00:47:34.830" style="s2">prevent patriarchy from becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.060" end="00:47:37.500" style="s2">dictatorship that is fundamentally what</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.830" end="00:47:41.460" style="s2">religion does well religion does not</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.500" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">allow to cater ship mm-hmm religion is</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.460" end="00:47:45.270" style="s2">the name of the separation of powers</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:47.250" style="s2">that&#39;s great I never thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.270" end="00:47:49.560" style="s2">before that&#39;s why I love the US</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.250" end="00:47:51.600" style="s2">Constitution because the US Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.560" end="00:47:55.410" style="s2">both has heritage going all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.600" end="00:47:57.900" style="s2">to the rationalism and going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.410" end="00:48:00.690" style="s2">best part of Christianity it mimics the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.900" end="00:48:02.820" style="s2">triad here so it mimics the Trinity of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.690" end="00:48:05.670" style="s2">Christianity and it certainly mimics to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.820" end="00:48:07.350" style="s2">try it that was preached it taught by</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.330" end="00:49:23.590" style="s2">obviously that is incredibly frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.580" end="00:49:24.970" style="s2">too but that&#39;s only that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.590" end="00:49:26.530" style="s2">when the society becomes more decadent</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.970" end="00:49:29.109" style="s2">and and people don&#39;t care about their</p>
