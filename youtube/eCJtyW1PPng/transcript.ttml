<p begin="00:00:02.760" end="00:00:06.839" style="s2">week Tuesday at 11:30 Pacific Standard</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.560" end="00:00:08.519" style="s2">Time today&#39;s question is what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.839" end="00:00:13.830" style="s2">preventing me from making the transition</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.519" end="00:00:15.719" style="s2">now we Co crafted this question last</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">week at the end of our last conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">was it kind of went into it nicely so</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">the I the idea cafe everyone takes has a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">chance to take five and up to five</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.730" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">minutes to share you don&#39;t need to use</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">the whole five minutes that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:31.579" style="s2">limit you can also pass and just be part</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:34.110" style="s2">of the discussion at the end</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.579" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">David&#39;s here but the Vice is still</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.110" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">getting situated welcome David and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">guess I&#39;ll each take our a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">share what is preventing me from making</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">the transition now I must reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">time to three minutes instead of five</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:53.699" style="s2">minutes but I think if somebody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">take five minutes that is there welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.699" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">to and otherwise most of us end up</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">taking less than it for game B it seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:02.039" style="s2">because we want to get to the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">piece so I&#39;m also just gonna wait for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.039" end="00:01:06.119" style="s2">raise of hands instead of muting and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">unmuting everyone once one first person</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">then I&#39;ll unmute everybody at the end so</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">who would like to start I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:19.070" style="s2">willing to start if nobody else is real</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:23.400" style="s2">simple I&#39;m just a narcissist and I I</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:20.989" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what&#39;s preventing me</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:23.909" style="s2">from transitioning now I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.989" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">simultaneously doing everything I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.909" end="00:02:30.840" style="s2">possibly be doing within my own capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">to create my version of the of the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.840" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">transition which is also like my</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:36.569" style="s2">personal for like like practicing rule</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:39.989" style="s2">Omega doing the meditation doing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.569" end="00:02:43.829" style="s2">also trying to figure out how this big</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.989" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">project and they keep evolving where</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.829" end="00:02:47.340" style="s2">they will eventually meet and I know</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:49.409" style="s2">that that is the case but allowing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.340" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">process and having faith in the process</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.409" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">that even if I don&#39;t quite see how they</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">meet yet they are as they they reach out</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:59.700" style="s2">and closer to each other I know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">what&#39;s stopping me it&#39;s my communication</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.700" end="00:03:05.459" style="s2">style is not having other people to work</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:07.470" style="s2">with and somewhat not figuring out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.459" end="00:03:09.269" style="s2">pieces in me that stopped me from</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.470" end="00:03:11.489" style="s2">working with other people on my project</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.269" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">and inviting other people and truly</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.489" end="00:03:15.780" style="s2">bringing it back to Ground Zero and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:17.159" style="s2">rebuilding it it together but what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.780" end="00:03:18.419" style="s2">looks like what is it I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.159" end="00:03:23.389" style="s2">build and even being able to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.419" end="00:03:25.769" style="s2">that is is a difficult piece for me but</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.389" end="00:03:27.329" style="s2">it&#39;s I think a lot of what stops</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.769" end="00:03:28.949" style="s2">everyone the resources not having the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.329" end="00:03:34.709" style="s2">money not having the time not having the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.949" end="00:03:37.889" style="s2">people not having a lot of the resources</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.709" end="00:03:40.889" style="s2">that are needed to create a project from</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.889" end="00:03:42.599" style="s2">from the base and I think that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.889" end="00:03:43.859" style="s2">find Omni wind solutions to that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.599" end="00:03:46.079" style="s2">that is what I am currently working on</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.859" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">is how do we not just create our own</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.079" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">individual projects but how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">a meta project that helps all of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:56.549" style="s2">individual projects what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">like and what does what can it offer us</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.549" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">as individuals what can it offer our</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">projects and what can we offer the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">greater the greater peace in creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:06.629" style="s2">the the software that helps us</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:09.319" style="s2">facilitate that which is what the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.629" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">cafe was supposed to meld into but now</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.319" end="00:04:14.010" style="s2">truly figuring out how to bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">to zero and how did it start co-creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.010" end="00:04:17.190" style="s2">what are the values you want to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">together what is the features we want in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.190" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">a collaboration platform and and that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">what is stopping me is everything and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">nothing because it is happening into its</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:33.560" style="s2">own in its own way in time so</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:35.940" style="s2">I&#39;m done who else would like to go David</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">only coast a bed was half a second</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.940" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">before breath okay so I&#39;d say that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:50.099" style="s2">and you think I&#39;m you saying I&#39;m upside</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:51.449" style="s2">down okay okay I think I&#39;m the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.099" end="00:04:52.979" style="s2">upside down to you I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.449" end="00:04:55.590" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.979" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">I&#39;ll say that the I would I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:05:00.569" style="s2">that many of the people that I see on</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:02.159" style="s2">this call and many of the people that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.569" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">see on the game B discussion board are</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.159" end="00:05:07.889" style="s2">actually in transition the game B we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">already in it so so there&#39;s something of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.889" end="00:05:13.409" style="s2">the question I&#39;ll modify the question of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:15.449" style="s2">what stops me from going all-in and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.409" end="00:05:17.909" style="s2">stops me from going all-in is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.449" end="00:05:20.009" style="s2">thought that right now if I go all-in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.909" end="00:05:21.900" style="s2">and fail that&#39;s it I have my one shot</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.009" end="00:05:23.969" style="s2">and I don&#39;t hit have confidence that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.900" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">have a way to go all-in in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.969" end="00:05:27.719" style="s2">allows that shot to count and the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:28.979" style="s2">that I would want it to I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.719" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">get a better sense that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.979" end="00:05:34.199" style="s2">that&#39;s possible but I&#39;m not yet seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:38.280" style="s2">enough congruent to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.199" end="00:05:40.259" style="s2">I don&#39;t need 100% safety I don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.280" end="00:05:42.330" style="s2">safety net that will guarantee that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.259" end="00:05:47.460" style="s2">don&#39;t fail I need a safety net that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.330" end="00:05:50.520" style="s2">allows me to to live again you know give</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.460" end="00:05:52.349" style="s2">me three lives to jump all in and figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:54.389" style="s2">out does that can I get something going</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.349" end="00:05:55.770" style="s2">or vote on some you know working with</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.389" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">somebody else on getting that going I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.770" end="00:05:59.639" style="s2">see a lot of congroo D and the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:02.310" style="s2">things that people are doing I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.639" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">really pleased print to see yours your</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.310" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">your site and I hadn&#39;t seen that before</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:07.830" style="s2">but some of the conversations that come</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:08.789" style="s2">out Eric I&#39;m loving what you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.830" end="00:06:12.779" style="s2">out there in terms of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.789" end="00:06:14.759" style="s2">interpretation of game B I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.779" end="00:06:16.199" style="s2">thinking a little bit more but then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.759" end="00:06:18.900" style="s2">talking a little a little bit more with</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.199" end="00:06:21.690" style="s2">Jordan Hall and I&#39;m talking with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.900" end="00:06:24.300" style="s2">filmmaker who&#39;s working on a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.690" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">that he&#39;s calling Renaissance 3.0 which</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.770" end="00:06:35.279" style="s2">what are we doing so I&#39;m excited that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.569" end="00:06:37.500" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff out there I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.279" end="00:06:40.469" style="s2">see that there are ways that technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.500" end="00:06:40.889" style="s2">are going to have to be integrated and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.469" end="00:06:43.499" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.889" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">figuring out what we do including I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.499" end="00:06:50.009" style="s2">think blockchain and AI and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:52.949" style="s2">virtual reality because those are very</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.009" end="00:06:55.439" style="s2">powerful technologies that will my my</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.949" end="00:06:57.830" style="s2">conception is and this is new this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.439" end="00:07:00.180" style="s2">like coming at me today is that our</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.830" end="00:07:01.620" style="s2">cognitive development as a species has</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.180" end="00:07:04.849" style="s2">been so produced in such a short period</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.620" end="00:07:07.499" style="s2">of time that were effectively</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.849" end="00:07:09.449" style="s2">invertebrate we&#39;re effectively cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.499" end="00:07:12.629" style="s2">in vertebrates we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.449" end="00:07:15.479" style="s2">cognitive structure bone structure and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.629" end="00:07:18.150" style="s2">muscle structure structure in order to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.479" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">be able to work together as an or as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.150" end="00:07:22.949" style="s2">effective collective organism and that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.360" style="s2">think that technology can move in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.949" end="00:07:26.009" style="s2">direction but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.360" end="00:07:27.719" style="s2">to be a simple thing to get that up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.009" end="00:07:29.639" style="s2">running I do think that we have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.719" end="00:07:31.379" style="s2">places where experimental efforts in</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.639" end="00:07:33.479" style="s2">that direction will show good results</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.379" end="00:07:35.969" style="s2">and I think as long as we learn from</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.479" end="00:07:38.279" style="s2">each other and and see amplify the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.969" end="00:07:40.139" style="s2">successes and compost the failures as I</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.279" end="00:07:41.400" style="s2">like to say that would be good so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.139" end="00:07:43.020" style="s2">really what what has stopped me is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.400" end="00:07:45.960" style="s2">really feeling like can I can I give</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.020" end="00:07:48.150" style="s2">myself fully to that without just having</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.960" end="00:07:50.069" style="s2">my one shot be wasted and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.150" end="00:07:51.979" style="s2">I&#39;m close to I&#39;ve been unemployed for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.069" end="00:07:54.509" style="s2">year and a half working on this</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.979" end="00:07:56.370" style="s2">exclusively I see a lot of it and doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.509" end="00:07:59.009" style="s2">a lot of work on that and that thing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.370" end="00:08:00.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay I&#39;m starting to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.009" end="00:08:01.259" style="s2">I could put together a team of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.180" end="00:08:02.849" style="s2">that I would want to work with and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.259" end="00:08:13.139" style="s2">figure out what the next steps are so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.849" end="00:08:18.360" style="s2">close that&#39;s it for me my turn um I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.139" end="00:08:20.629" style="s2">think we can split the question into mmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.360" end="00:08:23.490" style="s2">you know what is stopping me from</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.629" end="00:08:26.430" style="s2">achieving game B or transitioning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.490" end="00:08:30.149" style="s2">what is stopping us mm-hmm I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.430" end="00:08:32.190" style="s2">us six I mean us as a wider society</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.149" end="00:08:34.380" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many progressive</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.190" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">movements and causes and stuff and some</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.380" end="00:08:41.219" style="s2">of them conflict and intersect in</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:44.360" style="s2">various ways and you know when a wet</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.219" end="00:08:50.190" style="s2">weather comes to you know spiritual or</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.360" end="00:08:53.370" style="s2">you know kind of transformations to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.190" end="00:08:54.450" style="s2">with capitalism there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.370" end="00:08:57.000" style="s2">friction</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:08:59.820" style="s2">conflict and special interests and path</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.000" end="00:09:02.610" style="s2">dependence right that makes it difficult</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.820" end="00:09:04.680" style="s2">so so the question is it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.610" end="00:09:06.990" style="s2">twofold like what&#39;s stopping me it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.680" end="00:09:10.020" style="s2">personal question what&#39;s stopping us</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.990" end="00:09:11.700" style="s2">what are order the you know modes of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.020" end="00:09:14.010" style="s2">communication and you know things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.700" end="00:09:15.810" style="s2">come up in in this group anyways mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.010" end="00:09:18.870" style="s2">what are the financial relationships</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.810" end="00:09:22.290" style="s2">between us social status stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.870" end="00:09:26.750" style="s2">I think arguably this is more important</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.290" end="00:09:31.130" style="s2">like what stops us from transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.750" end="00:09:35.070" style="s2">because what stops me you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.130" end="00:09:37.620" style="s2">to some extent I feel like you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.070" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">advocating a better world my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.620" end="00:09:44.400" style="s2">right as a kid and as a student thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:47.670" style="s2">critically about the world you encounter</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.400" end="00:09:50.970" style="s2">all sorts of resistance different forms</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.670" end="00:09:53.070" style="s2">of resistance right and so I mean we you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.970" end="00:09:55.620" style="s2">know we have our personal limitations</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.070" end="00:09:57.420" style="s2">but we can&#39;t downplay the resistance of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.620" end="00:09:59.670" style="s2">the the system itself the structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.420" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">itself and it&#39;s you know as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:06.810" style="s2">might try to deny it it it sucks us back</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:09.030" style="s2">in and our behavior is reinforced like</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.810" end="00:10:11.640" style="s2">if you you know if you if you spend</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.030" end="00:10:13.770" style="s2">money and you kind of participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.640" end="00:10:16.230" style="s2">system you know if you watched watch a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.770" end="00:10:22.220" style="s2">movie or what or whatever you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.230" end="00:10:22.220" style="s2">sucked back into that system so mmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.700" end="00:10:28.710" style="s2">the question should be I think just</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:31.050" style="s2">flipped in that sense like what what are</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.710" end="00:10:34.050" style="s2">what are the points of resistance that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.050" end="00:10:36.420" style="s2">stop us from achieving this systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.050" end="00:10:39.030" style="s2">change because arguably lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.420" end="00:10:41.310" style="s2">have kind of arty me made the transition</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.030" end="00:10:44.190" style="s2">they&#39;re a good person on a personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.310" end="00:10:46.470" style="s2">level they are a good person on a kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.190" end="00:10:50.730" style="s2">of social level with the impact they</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.470" end="00:10:57.980" style="s2">make in the world but the system itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.730" end="00:10:57.980" style="s2">still hasn&#39;t changed I&#39;ll leave it there</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.320" end="00:11:03.340" style="s2">I keep that immunity myself and just</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.750" end="00:11:12.100" style="s2">talking Eric when she liked our next er</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.340" end="00:11:15.850" style="s2">Kira I am Maya just unpause there okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.100" end="00:11:18.010" style="s2">it&#39;s me okay um I mean there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.850" end="00:11:19.630" style="s2">preventing me I mean I I kind of did</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.010" end="00:11:21.880" style="s2">before I even had heard of game bi I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.630" end="00:11:23.710" style="s2">sort of kind of made the leap even</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.880" end="00:11:27.430" style="s2">before I even before I&#39;d heard of game B</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.710" end="00:11:29.530" style="s2">so I sold up I left my job I sold up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.430" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">equity I had in my house has brought me</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.530" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">a place in Spain and I have a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:36.070" style="s2">slush fund to see me through emergencies</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:37.270" style="s2">and you know my way to see myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.070" end="00:11:38.530" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know I was a teacher oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.270" end="00:11:39.790" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like I have a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.530" end="00:11:42.610" style="s2">money so my way of seeing myself through</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.790" end="00:11:43.840" style="s2">is to reduce my expenditure right and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.610" end="00:11:47.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.840" end="00:11:49.480" style="s2">on and in doing so you also at the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.500" end="00:11:50.530" style="s2">time massively reduce your impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.480" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">world you know I don&#39;t have a car</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.530" end="00:11:54.520" style="s2">anymore for example I eat the majority</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:56.200" style="s2">of my own fruit and veg I eat my own</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.520" end="00:11:58.350" style="s2">eggs you know this but I say my own eggs</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.200" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">of course mine mine you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.350" end="00:12:03.550" style="s2">but yeah so that&#39;s kind of thing so as I</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:07.180" style="s2">said I&#39;ve kind of done all of that bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.550" end="00:12:09.790" style="s2">anyway what holds me back is not any</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.180" end="00:12:12.310" style="s2">material thing time money anything like</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.790" end="00:12:14.020" style="s2">that you know indeed to go to a job even</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.310" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">kids I mean I think kids is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.020" end="00:12:17.680" style="s2">reason that people can&#39;t really throw</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.300" style="s2">themselves as if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.680" end="00:12:20.950" style="s2">responsibilities to a household I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.300" end="00:12:23.230" style="s2">that that&#39;s a huge thing to hold you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.950" end="00:12:26.590" style="s2">back but for me personally what holds me</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.230" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">back is my own my own right my own</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.590" end="00:12:30.760" style="s2">laziness I mean I&#39;ve got unmet needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:33.190" style="s2">coming out of my ass you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.760" end="00:12:36.310" style="s2">know it&#39;s working on that stuff it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.190" end="00:12:38.650" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the personal inner stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.310" end="00:12:43.540" style="s2">in order to try and prepare myself and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.650" end="00:12:45.790" style="s2">make myself fit for the humility and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.540" end="00:12:46.870" style="s2">openness and vulnerability and so on</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.790" end="00:12:48.670" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be required in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.870" end="00:12:50.380" style="s2">formulation of whatever game B is going</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.670" end="00:12:52.570" style="s2">to be so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s what holds</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.380" end="00:12:55.080" style="s2">me back is my own is my own plain</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.570" end="00:12:55.080" style="s2">and simple</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.550" end="00:13:05.730" style="s2">thanks Eric and no oh don&#39;t let a man</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.700" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">meet you I think I heard doing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.730" end="00:13:13.410" style="s2">simultaneous all right Richard okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:14.790" style="s2">interesting I have been you know as</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.410" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">everyone&#39;s been sharing been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.790" end="00:13:21.330" style="s2">about what my answer to this is and my</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">experience has been over the last five</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.330" end="00:13:28.440" style="s2">years is that I think what&#39;s stopping me</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:30.420" style="s2">right now is not being clear on what</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.440" end="00:13:34.290" style="s2">question it is that I&#39;m trying to answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.420" end="00:13:36.750" style="s2">and usually once I get clear on what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.290" end="00:13:41.190" style="s2">is what question it is that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.750" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">to answer I move forward and I might&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.190" end="00:13:47.220" style="s2">been the I&#39;m kind of of the perspective</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.709" end="00:14:02.490" style="s2">anywhere else and so just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.860" end="00:14:04.110" style="s2">resting into the emotions that come up</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.500" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">is that I&#39;m doing and and another piece</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.330" end="00:14:21.630" style="s2">I think that doesn&#39;t slow me down but is</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:28.020" style="s2">a part of the process is</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.630" end="00:14:29.490" style="s2">I am very I&#39;m I love to research and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.020" end="00:14:32.010" style="s2">I&#39;m very familiar with all the game B</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.890" end="00:15:20.760" style="s2">words that you&#39;re gonna understand so</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.450" end="00:15:25.260" style="s2">that I can so that we can be on the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.760" end="00:15:27.290" style="s2">page and move something forward and so</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.370" end="00:16:04.050" style="s2">other piece that I think is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.830" end="00:16:06.210" style="s2">just starting to get into is connecting</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.780" end="00:16:55.270" style="s2">that whole thing of the carrot being</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.010" end="00:16:56.470" style="s2">dangled right in front of you all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.270" end="00:16:58.570" style="s2">way through your life right and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.470" end="00:17:00.250" style="s2">spend your whole life thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.570" end="00:17:01.810" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get somewhere and if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.250" end="00:17:03.250" style="s2">just realize that there is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.810" end="00:17:04.660" style="s2">a destination right there is only you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.250" end="00:17:06.670" style="s2">journey there&#39;s not a destination that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.660" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">that that so yeah that but the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.670" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">thing was the trusting your own voice</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:13.170" style="s2">thing that&#39;s been a really big thing for</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:18.130" style="s2">me as well I think I think I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.170" end="00:17:19.870" style="s2">recently figured out what my role is in</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.130" end="00:17:21.250" style="s2">all of this if you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.870" end="00:17:22.240" style="s2">because I&#39;m not nearly as smart as some</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.250" end="00:17:24.580" style="s2">of these guys you know what I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.240" end="00:17:26.470" style="s2">can&#39;t contribute at that level I just I</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.580" end="00:17:27.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have the breadth of reading I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.470" end="00:17:29.350" style="s2">don&#39;t have the intellect you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.790" end="00:17:32.110" style="s2">mean but what I what I am good at I</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.350" end="00:17:34.900" style="s2">think is translating what they are doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.110" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">down to a level where you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.900" end="00:17:38.200" style="s2">other people can understand it a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:39.700" style="s2">bit more clearly so I that&#39;sthat&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.200" end="00:17:46.060" style="s2">I&#39;m going to try and focus on now in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.700" end="00:17:47.770" style="s2">this media I really appreciate that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.060" end="00:17:50.470" style="s2">there was what came to mind as you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.770" end="00:17:53.560" style="s2">sharing that was something that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.470" end="00:17:56.500" style="s2">talked about in the conversation that he</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.560" end="00:17:58.570" style="s2">had with John for Becky on rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.500" end="00:18:02.860" style="s2">a couple weeks ago and he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.570" end="00:18:04.930" style="s2">that you know people being open to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.860" end="00:18:07.330" style="s2">know maybe it&#39;s a seven-year-old girl in</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.930" end="00:18:09.820" style="s2">Peru who has the answer you know is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.330" end="00:18:12.430" style="s2">it is going at the the right vibrational</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.820" end="00:18:18.100" style="s2">level for whatever that answer is needed</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.430" end="00:18:21.010" style="s2">and so for me it&#39;s getting over the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.100" end="00:18:27.220" style="s2">that I&#39;m supposed to that I&#39;m supposed</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.010" end="00:18:28.840" style="s2">to be as smart as the people who are you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.220" end="00:18:31.720" style="s2">know because I have that staying</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.840" end="00:18:34.059" style="s2">that same parasitic thinking that says</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.720" end="00:18:36.519" style="s2">I&#39;m supposed to be that smart to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.059" end="00:18:39.220" style="s2">participate in the conversation and not</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.519" end="00:18:42.399" style="s2">trusting that I have something to some I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.220" end="00:18:45.549" style="s2">love that you&#39;re you&#39;re getting to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.399" end="00:18:48.009" style="s2">place of feeling like you have like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.549" end="00:18:50.230" style="s2">know what your what your role is and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.009" end="00:18:51.549" style="s2">that&#39;s I think you know asking what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.230" end="00:19:00.429" style="s2">the question I&#39;m trying to answer I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.549" end="00:19:02.769" style="s2">don&#39;t know what my role is yet I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.429" end="00:19:03.490" style="s2">looked at and say cure that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.769" end="00:19:06.190" style="s2">that you said that was really</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.490" end="00:19:07.299" style="s2">interesting is to meet a common thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.190" end="00:19:09.460" style="s2">that caught my attention the most is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.299" end="00:19:16.269" style="s2">things are exactly how they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.460" end="00:19:17.820" style="s2">and they can&#39;t stay this way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.269" end="00:19:20.769" style="s2">something really beautiful in that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.820" end="00:19:23.289" style="s2">there&#39;s something too in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.769" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">hearing that as the parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.289" end="00:19:27.190" style="s2">right this is something that when when</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.110" style="s2">John Vicki talks about the parasite</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.190" end="00:19:32.350" style="s2">processing in the way that we&#39;re wired</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.110" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">right now it&#39;s beneficial to think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.350" end="00:19:36.490" style="s2">not all parasites are bad right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:38.649" style="s2">got parasites in her system parasites</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.490" end="00:19:39.759" style="s2">are serving the function an important</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.649" end="00:19:41.320" style="s2">function of the world there is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.759" end="00:19:43.570" style="s2">stabilizing force that parasites now</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.320" end="00:19:45.429" style="s2">which is counterintuitive to what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.570" end="00:19:46.869" style="s2">think we think we want to get rid of all</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.429" end="00:19:48.879" style="s2">of the bugs and all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.869" end="00:19:51.009" style="s2">are wrong and the Ruth the root of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.879" end="00:19:53.350" style="s2">is no we can&#39;t we&#39;re actually doing this</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.009" end="00:19:54.999" style="s2">part of my sense of this and this really</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.350" end="00:19:56.619" style="s2">started to become clear and Eric I like</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.999" end="00:20:00.009" style="s2">what you said as well about being a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.619" end="00:20:02.350" style="s2">communicator you know I know people I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.009" end="00:20:03.789" style="s2">tried to point people to John for Vicki</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.350" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">and Jordan Hall and Daniels might Berger</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.789" end="00:20:07.869" style="s2">and those guys and people look at me and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:15.070" style="s2">say I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.869" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">about I don&#39;t know why it matters you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.070" end="00:20:21.460" style="s2">don&#39;t get it but I&#39;m noticing I had a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.559" style="s2">discussion last week with a friend who</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.460" end="00:20:25.899" style="s2">who also doesn&#39;t get that she&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.559" end="00:20:27.309" style="s2">gonna watch that stuff but she cares a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.899" end="00:20:29.379" style="s2">lot about the climate she wants to make</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.379" end="00:20:33.460" style="s2">discussion about what the next steps are</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.179" end="00:20:35.470" style="s2">I kept saying everything you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.460" end="00:20:36.700" style="s2">discussing and proposing is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.470" end="00:20:39.129" style="s2">the same same as changing your</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.700" end="00:20:41.289" style="s2">lightbulbs or not flushing I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.129" end="00:20:42.490" style="s2">not it&#39;s great it&#39;s necessary it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.490" end="00:20:48.429" style="s2">not sufficient it&#39;s it&#39;s maybe half of a</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.429" end="00:20:51.580" style="s2">most radical things you&#39;re thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.720" end="00:20:53.049" style="s2">maybe the most radical things that all</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.580" end="00:20:55.149" style="s2">of us think of if we all agreed right</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.049" end="00:20:57.639" style="s2">now to do things that we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.149" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">with our game a minds we&#39;d probably do</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.639" end="00:21:01.419" style="s2">five percent of what&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:02.860" style="s2">transition so there&#39;s something in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.419" end="00:21:05.080" style="s2">that&#39;s really recognizing what does it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.860" end="00:21:07.480" style="s2">take to really fully transition into</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.080" end="00:21:09.279" style="s2">that I&#39;ll give you a example of some a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.480" end="00:21:10.899" style="s2">couple of things that help me think</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.279" end="00:21:12.369" style="s2">about this and then I think are we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.899" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">useful for other people as well this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.369" end="00:21:15.700" style="s2">kind of a long the idea of how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:17.970" style="s2">communicate this to other people one is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.700" end="00:21:20.440" style="s2">two examples of riding a bicycle</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.059" end="00:21:29.350" style="s2">right I can understand I can read about</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.999" end="00:21:31.119" style="s2">somebody could tell me about riding a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.350" end="00:21:32.830" style="s2">bicycle but like feeling that bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.119" end="00:21:35.889" style="s2">and learn how to do it myself I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.830" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">have it down now after I&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.889" end="00:21:40.119" style="s2">there are a couple of examples that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:42.279" style="s2">and that I have that really show me that</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.490" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">has to do with our propositional</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.220" end="00:22:36.669" style="s2">in that system in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.619" end="00:22:39.369" style="s2">feels like we&#39;re fighting each other</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.769" end="00:22:48.940" style="s2">bicycle where that and there&#39;s a video</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.139" end="00:22:50.740" style="s2">online where somebody has switched the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.940" end="00:22:52.690" style="s2">steering wheel so it goes the opposite</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.950" end="00:22:58.450" style="s2">direction is incredibly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.020" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">the guy who was doing the video took six</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.450" end="00:23:03.430" style="s2">months of an hour of more our port per</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:05.500" style="s2">day practicing to do that and finally</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.430" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">was able to do it and once he was able</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.500" end="00:23:08.680" style="s2">to do it it was like oh that&#39;s cool now</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:14.170" style="s2">can I go back and write an old bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.680" end="00:23:16.780" style="s2">and he couldn&#39;t he but it took him 20</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.170" end="00:23:19.480" style="s2">minutes of trying per ride but the old</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.780" end="00:23:22.600" style="s2">sabbatical for it and a rework and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.480" end="00:23:25.660" style="s2">that moment his whole system flipped so</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.600" end="00:23:28.420" style="s2">it&#39;s showing how dissonance between our</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.420" end="00:23:33.010" style="s2">are so out of a lion trying to do</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.780" end="00:23:54.370" style="s2">what John for fake is talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:56.860" style="s2">this ecology of practices this is going</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.370" end="00:23:58.570" style="s2">to be an immense amount of practice so</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.860" end="00:24:01.330" style="s2">it&#39;s in some sense it&#39;s more than just</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.570" end="00:24:03.160" style="s2">oh you know so when I say I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.330" end="00:24:04.690" style="s2">going to fail I know I&#39;m going to fail</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.160" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna pull off that by six thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.690" end="00:24:09.250" style="s2">times right it&#39;s going to be it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:10.390" style="s2">to be a terrible frustrating time to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.250" end="00:24:11.500" style="s2">through that and if I&#39;m going through a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.390" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">terrible frustrating time where other</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.500" end="00:24:14.530" style="s2">people are yelling at me to because</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:21.700" style="s2">frustration I wanted David when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.960" end="00:24:23.830" style="s2">shared in the beginning and you had said</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.700" end="00:24:25.780" style="s2">that what&#39;s stopping you from doing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.830" end="00:24:27.730" style="s2">transition is that safety and being all</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.780" end="00:24:29.590" style="s2">in you don&#39;t need it to be safe safe we</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.730" end="00:24:31.420" style="s2">need to be safe enough and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.590" end="00:24:33.910" style="s2">wondering just what you meant by all in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.420" end="00:24:36.790" style="s2">like what what is it that&#39;s at risk</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.910" end="00:24:41.400" style="s2">there for you that you aren&#39;t all in</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.790" end="00:24:43.930" style="s2">with that you would be in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.400" end="00:24:49.540" style="s2">well so that example that I just said is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.930" end="00:24:51.340" style="s2">a is a good one if I said I&#39;m all in on</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.540" end="00:24:53.410" style="s2">the you know so think about the person</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.340" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">who rode tried to spend six months</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.410" end="00:24:56.560" style="s2">learning how to ride the bicycle was</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:25:00.310" style="s2">opposite if that was his only mode of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.560" end="00:25:01.720" style="s2">transportation oh my god I mean I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.310" end="00:25:03.940" style="s2">go anywhere for six months until I get</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.720" end="00:25:07.900" style="s2">this thing where I can ride it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.940" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">it can&#39;t be more than a hobby until I</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.900" end="00:25:12.250" style="s2">can until I can ride the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:14.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I mean by all-in can I</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.250" end="00:25:16.390" style="s2">actually make the living doing that when</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.950" end="00:25:18.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.390" end="00:25:20.890" style="s2">about operates and all of us have</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.690" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">propositional ways of proposing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.890" end="00:25:26.920" style="s2">this couldn&#39;t work there I believe</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:28.420" style="s2">absolutely because what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.920" end="00:25:30.790" style="s2">about the bike right like if that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.420" end="00:25:32.410" style="s2">his only mode of transportation that</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.790" end="00:25:33.670" style="s2">would be ridiculous he would have had he</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.410" end="00:25:35.560" style="s2">would have learned it faster but he</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.670" end="00:25:37.900" style="s2">would have been reliant on it much you</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.560" end="00:25:40.810" style="s2">know whereas that&#39;s not what he did he</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.900" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">spent an hour a day playing practicing</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.810" end="00:25:45.370" style="s2">on this new form well I&#39;m guessing</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.360" style="s2">walking driving writing not writing his</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.370" end="00:25:49.030" style="s2">old bike because he&#39;s trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.360" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">this new one but let the old bike go and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.030" end="00:25:53.170" style="s2">still have his other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:55.570" style="s2">transportation so in a way he was all in</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.170" end="00:25:58.030" style="s2">because he committed that hour a day but</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.570" end="00:25:59.920" style="s2">in another way he&#39;s not all-in right</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.030" end="00:26:01.870" style="s2">he&#39;s not gonna like sit there and only</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.920" end="00:26:05.700" style="s2">be on that bike and so finding ways for</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.870" end="00:26:08.380" style="s2">each of us that feels safe enough to try</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.700" end="00:26:09.700" style="s2">so that we cuz for me I know that our</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.380" end="00:26:11.680" style="s2">propositional no mean like I</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.960" end="00:28:36.110" style="s2">come into those ego conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.730" end="00:28:38.060" style="s2">recognizing okay this probably has</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.110" end="00:28:39.500" style="s2">nothing to do with the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.060" end="00:28:42.020" style="s2">we&#39;re having at this moment and probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.500" end="00:28:44.350" style="s2">has way more to do with some core belief</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.020" end="00:28:46.670" style="s2">this person has about themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.350" end="00:28:49.250" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re coming up against</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.670" end="00:28:51.080" style="s2">being unable to hear them and and one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.250" end="00:28:53.090" style="s2">the things that in the conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.080" end="00:28:55.310" style="s2">had with Jordan Paul on Friday one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.090" end="00:28:57.290" style="s2">the things he said is how do you invite</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.310" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">someone to listen how do you invite</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.290" end="00:29:03.740" style="s2">someone to want to grow up and and like</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:05.510" style="s2">in that it&#39;s I have to like figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.740" end="00:29:07.930" style="s2">how do I work through my that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.510" end="00:29:11.000" style="s2">prevents me from listening but because</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.930" end="00:29:13.040" style="s2">obviously when somebody like my</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.000" end="00:29:16.460" style="s2">experience is usually when somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.040" end="00:29:19.340" style="s2">like really fighting on and stuck on a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.460" end="00:29:22.580" style="s2">particular issue it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.340" end="00:29:24.620" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a core idea about them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.580" end="00:29:26.330" style="s2">it&#39;s often a more core idea about</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.620" end="00:29:28.400" style="s2">themselves that they&#39;re stuck with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.330" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to work through then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.400" end="00:29:36.320" style="s2">actual like topic at hand</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:36.850" style="s2">and and how do you and and one of I</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.320" end="00:29:38.350" style="s2">think one</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.850" end="00:29:40.900" style="s2">questions I&#39;m trying to answer is how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.350" end="00:29:43.330" style="s2">you help someone through that transition</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.900" end="00:29:44.710" style="s2">when they go into that place of fighting</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.330" end="00:29:47.500" style="s2">on that because they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.710" end="00:29:48.910" style="s2">protect themselves and how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.500" end="00:29:51.430" style="s2">you make space for them to move through</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.910" end="00:29:56.770" style="s2">that piece without losing sight of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.430" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">bigger part of the conversation just be</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.770" end="00:30:00.420" style="s2">folks no Anthony go ahead so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:04.420" style="s2">say you go ahead might you go ahead I</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.420" end="00:30:08.170" style="s2">was just listening to Jim and Nora</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.420" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">Bateson and Jim asked her the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.170" end="00:30:13.510" style="s2">question I asked everyone is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:17.530" style="s2">see reality do you believe there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.510" end="00:30:20.650" style="s2">objective reality or is it all you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.530" end="00:30:23.410" style="s2">just in your mind and they decided it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.650" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">was both because Jim loved her book</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.410" end="00:30:28.120" style="s2">which was like we have a window on</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:31.480" style="s2">reality but the window was also part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.120" end="00:30:33.580" style="s2">reality and so are we but something Eric</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.480" end="00:30:35.290" style="s2">said about Ellen wants I&#39;d follow down a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.580" end="00:30:38.440" style="s2">lot for like 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.290" end="00:30:41.110" style="s2">and if you asked Allen Watts he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.440" end="00:30:45.670" style="s2">to tell you you are never going to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.110" end="00:30:47.740" style="s2">rid of gamei you haven&#39;t no possibility</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.670" end="00:30:52.330" style="s2">of having game be without having game a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.740" end="00:30:55.420" style="s2">so we have to like triage the PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.330" end="00:30:58.260" style="s2">people from game a forever because</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.420" end="00:30:58.260" style="s2">they&#39;re not going away</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.800" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">well you might sense the center of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:10.300" style="s2">gravity I listened to that and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">reminded me of something about the late</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.300" end="00:31:17.080" style="s2">1970s I was a distance runner and I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:21.100" style="s2">coaching at a camp for young Olympians</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.080" end="00:31:23.770" style="s2">and I had to race with them and I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.100" end="00:31:26.110" style="s2">like 40 years old at the time so there</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.770" end="00:31:28.630" style="s2">was this huge steep hill in Slippery</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.110" end="00:31:30.670" style="s2">Rock where we were and I they were all</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.630" end="00:31:33.010" style="s2">ahead of me like 100 yards ahead of me</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.670" end="00:31:35.020" style="s2">and when we hit the that hill it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.010" end="00:31:37.000" style="s2">like almost half a mile straight out I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.020" end="00:31:38.710" style="s2">passed all of them on the way up and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.000" end="00:31:40.900" style="s2">they said how did you do that and I said</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.710" end="00:31:44.200" style="s2">you lean into the hill so your center of</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.900" end="00:31:46.750" style="s2">gravity pulls you up the hill up there</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.200" end="00:31:48.260" style="s2">you know in that year almost all of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.750" end="00:31:50.210" style="s2">kids wanted their ski</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.260" end="00:31:55.790" style="s2">because they figured out how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.210" end="00:32:00.740" style="s2">do that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.790" end="00:32:03.620" style="s2">anecdote and I want to use it to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.740" end="00:32:06.800" style="s2">segue to make to make a terrible segue</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.620" end="00:32:16.310" style="s2">joke - uh - the fact that Bernie Sanders</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.800" end="00:32:17.780" style="s2">is also a distance runner it&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.890" end="00:32:29.020" style="s2">but but it also connects with what</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.980" end="00:33:27.260" style="s2">isn&#39;t on the plane that we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.390" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">operating on it really is learning to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.260" end="00:33:33.460" style="s2">operate in another dimension that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:37.010" style="s2">never it&#39;s not native to any of us and</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.010" end="00:33:43.370" style="s2">is by necessity game a right it&#39;s off</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.150" end="00:33:45.050" style="s2">the track and just recognize that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.370" end="00:33:46.760" style="s2">feel the frustration of it and here I</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.050" end="00:33:47.990" style="s2">love what you said as well that my</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.760" end="00:33:49.490" style="s2">friend and I did get to the point of</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.990" end="00:33:51.290" style="s2">recognize that and then and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.490" end="00:33:53.180" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve mentioned in other</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.290" end="00:33:55.820" style="s2">talks that I have a circling practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.180" end="00:33:58.250" style="s2">I&#39;m sorting is a relational practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.820" end="00:34:00.630" style="s2">that really is good about feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.250" end="00:34:03.720" style="s2">that vulnerable space of Am I</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.630" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">enough while still staying on track</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.720" end="00:34:07.710" style="s2">staying with myself and staying with you</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:09.300" style="s2">through that and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.710" end="00:34:11.960" style="s2">challenging practice to learn but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.300" end="00:34:14.429" style="s2">something that I think is a key skill</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.960" end="00:34:17.220" style="s2">can I just add one thing to that am i</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.429" end="00:34:18.899" style="s2">enough feeling because as you were</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.220" end="00:34:20.550" style="s2">telling the story about the argument</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.899" end="00:34:23.190" style="s2">between you and your friend a similar</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.550" end="00:34:26.310" style="s2">but slightly different feeling came up</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.190" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">for me that isn&#39;t necessarily female</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.310" end="00:34:31.080" style="s2">related or personal inadequate personnel</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:33.480" style="s2">inadequacy relates bit more a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.080" end="00:34:35.159" style="s2">helplessness right there but hang on but</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.480" end="00:34:36.659" style="s2">but but planting trees is something I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.159" end="00:34:37.710" style="s2">can get involved in and do you know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.659" end="00:34:39.210" style="s2">I mean you&#39;re telling me that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.710" end="00:34:41.310" style="s2">gonna make any difference and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.210" end="00:34:42.929" style="s2">bit but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a male or a</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.310" end="00:34:45.750" style="s2">female thing I think I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.929" end="00:34:49.830" style="s2">deep sense of helplessness and despair</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.750" end="00:34:52.050" style="s2">that resides at a just below the level</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.830" end="00:34:53.879" style="s2">of consciousness kind of place you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.050" end="00:34:56.070" style="s2">what I mean and I think it feeds into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.879" end="00:34:58.740" style="s2">lot of what&#39;s going on in people&#39;s minds</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.070" end="00:34:59.790" style="s2">and so that that reaction to you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.740" end="00:35:00.930" style="s2">planting trees not going to make a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.790" end="00:35:02.460" style="s2">difference not you know turning this</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.930" end="00:35:03.930" style="s2">half off when I close my when I brush my</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.460" end="00:35:05.880" style="s2">teeth you know what I mean it&#39;s it these</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.930" end="00:35:07.770" style="s2">are things that people could actually do</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.880" end="00:35:09.870" style="s2">and to feel like they&#39;re meaningless is</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.770" end="00:35:11.100" style="s2">taking something really important away</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.870" end="00:35:12.600" style="s2">from because they already feel really</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.100" end="00:35:14.580" style="s2"> helpless right she&#39;s saying that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.600" end="00:35:16.500" style="s2">you know even this is pointless so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.580" end="00:35:28.920" style="s2">think I think that that is part of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.500" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">also listen to both Kure listen to both</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.920" end="00:35:33.960" style="s2">of the sessions he had with Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:36.660" style="s2">it was really great I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.960" end="00:35:43.110" style="s2">remember any question about it but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.660" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">was really helpful yeah I was grateful</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.110" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">for his time because it did help a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.840" end="00:36:03.870" style="s2">he as as you guys were Eric as you were</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:06.440" style="s2">talking there was something that was</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.310" end="00:36:13.000" style="s2">a point of mine that actually somebody</p>

<p begin="00:36:13.000" end="00:36:18.980" style="s2">somebody posted a conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:20.630" style="s2">he does a lot of writing about moral</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.980" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">framework because he&#39;s in very much in</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.110" end="00:36:45.650" style="s2">you said of like if you take away that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.600" end="00:36:47.960" style="s2">this planting trees isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.650" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">you know mean it&#39;s something but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.960" end="00:36:53.450" style="s2">not even scratching the surface it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:58.160" style="s2">like there&#39;s that sense of despair that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.450" end="00:36:59.360" style="s2">comes up that&#39;s like why do I even like</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.160" end="00:37:01.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t you know there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.360" end="00:37:03.380" style="s2">moments you know where I might be in</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.790" end="00:37:05.090" style="s2">that space and where somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.380" end="00:37:08.150" style="s2">something I&#39;m like why am I even trying</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.090" end="00:37:10.490" style="s2">you know and and you know and I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.150" end="00:37:13.190" style="s2">to I had to do an extensive amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.490" end="00:37:18.860" style="s2">personal work around you know like my</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.190" end="00:37:21.980" style="s2">default is either all or nothing and if</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.860" end="00:37:23.300" style="s2">if it&#39;s not perfect then I might as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.980" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">just give up you know if it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.300" end="00:37:29.000" style="s2">perfect answer I might as well just not</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:31.460" style="s2">do any of it at all and what trend you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.000" end="00:37:33.290" style="s2">know that transition from you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.460" end="00:37:36.470" style="s2">because ultimately all of this is about</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.290" end="00:37:39.320" style="s2">a maturation process it&#39;s helping people</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.470" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">grow through whatever emotional place</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.320" end="00:37:42.200" style="s2">they got stuck he and his child and</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">childhood because we all got stuck</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.200" end="00:37:48.740" style="s2">somewhere and and how do you grow</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:50.810" style="s2">through that piece especially when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.740" end="00:37:52.970" style="s2">don&#39;t know that like okay one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.810" end="00:37:55.070" style="s2">common places people get stuck is in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.970" end="00:37:56.540" style="s2">black-and-white thinking that if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.070" end="00:37:58.700" style="s2">know which is usually about three years</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.540" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">old and it&#39;s all you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.700" end="00:38:03.230" style="s2">all-or-nothing if and and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:09.020" style="s2">help somebody transition through that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.230" end="00:38:11.150" style="s2">like that&#39;s because and and and when</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.020" end="00:38:14.120" style="s2">somebody is goes to that place of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.150" end="00:38:16.100" style="s2">absolute despair how to meet them where</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.120" end="00:38:19.490" style="s2">they are so that they&#39;re you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.100" end="00:38:20.340" style="s2">like so what people don&#39;t want to give</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.490" end="00:38:22.590" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.340" end="00:38:24.330" style="s2">well if you felt it yourself then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.590" end="00:38:26.550" style="s2">should be able to make some reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.330" end="00:38:28.530" style="s2">attempts if you wish to do so at meeting</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.550" end="00:38:30.540" style="s2">them there right if you experience there</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.530" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">feeling yourself and it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.540" end="00:38:36.710" style="s2">right yeah and I think I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:36.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve all experienced her at some point</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.190" end="00:38:44.420" style="s2">so it occurs to me as you say that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.900" end="00:38:47.130" style="s2">we&#39;re really trying it is very akin to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.420" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">trying to convince a three-year-old a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.130" end="00:38:51.000" style="s2">five-year-old that they can do without</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:53.100" style="s2">their favorite stuffed animal or at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.000" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that gives them comfort</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.100" end="00:38:59.190" style="s2">and so there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">comfort that we think we get from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.190" end="00:39:04.710" style="s2">habit of the way that we are it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:06.840" style="s2">familiarity and and so even if I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.710" end="00:39:09.570" style="s2">reason with them even if I can empathize</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.840" end="00:39:11.220" style="s2">with them getting them to empathize with</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.570" end="00:39:13.230" style="s2">themselves as they&#39;re giving it up</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.220" end="00:39:15.810" style="s2">finding a way to lean into that hill</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.230" end="00:39:17.310" style="s2">yeah that center of gravity so they can</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.810" end="00:39:20.310" style="s2">do it so they can find a way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.310" end="00:39:22.350" style="s2">in there is a real is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.310" end="00:39:25.170" style="s2">challenge I don&#39;t think it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.350" end="00:39:26.820" style="s2">want to undermine that and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.170" end="00:39:28.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just empathy that that gets us</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.820" end="00:39:30.540" style="s2">there but I think I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.890" end="00:39:37.230" style="s2">gives me a good sense the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.540" end="00:39:40.740" style="s2">before us something John Parvati said</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.230" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">about acting out when my daughter was</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.740" end="00:39:45.690" style="s2">three years old she liked all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:50.150" style="s2">laughter that she got before she was too</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.690" end="00:39:52.650" style="s2">but you know making up words or</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.150" end="00:39:55.020" style="s2">misunderstanding words like I&#39;d say well</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.650" end="00:39:56.310" style="s2">for the time being we can&#39;t do that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.020" end="00:40:01.320" style="s2">should say well where do these time</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.310" end="00:40:03.540" style="s2">beans come from but once he by the age</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.320" end="00:40:05.250" style="s2">of two she learned how she learned the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.540" end="00:40:07.130" style="s2">whole language so she couldn&#39;t fool</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.250" end="00:40:09.870" style="s2">anybody anymore but she was still trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.130" end="00:40:13.080" style="s2">so what we did was we did what John</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.870" end="00:40:16.410" style="s2">lavake said we worked out she had a four</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.340" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">was a masterful conversation that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.410" end="00:42:21.550" style="s2">because she this woman was able to tap</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:25.110" style="s2">into and really acknowledge the woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.550" end="00:42:27.850" style="s2">deep fear and care for her daughter and</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.249" end="00:42:57.099" style="s2">takes massive amounts of skill you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.239" end="00:43:00.009" style="s2">that it also comes to mind I know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.099" end="00:43:01.660" style="s2">I&#39;m part of the one of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.009" end="00:43:04.869" style="s2">in the game be discussion group was</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.660" end="00:43:08.259" style="s2">about various you know ways that we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.869" end="00:43:09.969" style="s2">do things better and I recommended that</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.259" end="00:43:12.729" style="s2">people if people haven&#39;t watched the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.969" end="00:43:14.769" style="s2">Bill Gates special on Netflix the inside</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.729" end="00:43:16.930" style="s2">dils brain I recommend it for two</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.769" end="00:43:19.209" style="s2">reasons one it&#39;s inspirational to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.930" end="00:43:21.430" style="s2">how much he&#39;s thinking too it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.209" end="00:43:23.739" style="s2">that he&#39;s still thinking of treating</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.430" end="00:43:26.259" style="s2">symptoms and he&#39;s not really thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.739" end="00:43:28.349" style="s2">about how to really get underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.259" end="00:43:31.180" style="s2">cause he&#39;s and there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.349" end="00:43:33.489" style="s2">money interests have the habit of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.180" end="00:43:35.499" style="s2">leaning in in a specific way to solve</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.489" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">the problems and it&#39;s a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.499" end="00:43:40.569" style="s2">habitual that&#39;s not going to serve us</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.359" end="00:43:45.459" style="s2">well and it&#39;s interesting to think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.569" end="00:43:47.019" style="s2">what would what does it take for I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.459" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of opportunity one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.019" end="00:43:49.809" style="s2">the things that I think is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:52.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of opportunity here&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.809" end="00:43:54.519" style="s2">noting the way that we&#39;re addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.660" end="00:43:57.609" style="s2">certain kinds of behavior I think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.519" end="00:43:58.989" style="s2">that in addition to alcohol sex whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.609" end="00:44:01.420" style="s2">kinds of things work</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.989" end="00:44:02.549" style="s2">coping mechanisms that we have for</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.420" end="00:44:04.599" style="s2">dealing with their own trauma</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.549" end="00:44:06.459" style="s2">recognizing that we&#39;re all dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.599" end="00:44:09.039" style="s2">some level of trauma from having a nor</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.459" end="00:44:13.989" style="s2">to a body effectively and as we come</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.039" end="00:44:16.479" style="s2">into resonance an awakening to how much</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.989" end="00:44:19.209" style="s2">we&#39;ve put off there is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.479" end="00:44:21.219" style="s2">backlash of brief that comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.209" end="00:44:23.380" style="s2">that and being able to lean into that</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.219" end="00:44:25.329" style="s2">into that grief and the processing in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.380" end="00:44:27.549" style="s2">healthy way and recognizing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.329" end="00:44:28.779" style="s2">necessary rather than trying to medicate</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.549" end="00:44:32.049" style="s2">it cope with it or make it go away</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.779" end="00:44:33.459" style="s2">really be treated as a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.049" end="00:44:36.969" style="s2">process I think is something that is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.459" end="00:44:39.160" style="s2">powerful a powerful thing to do and to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.969" end="00:44:41.140" style="s2">recognize that billionaires are addicted</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.160" end="00:44:43.239" style="s2">to addicted to kind of thinking of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.140" end="00:44:45.880" style="s2">certain way it may install things and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.239" end="00:44:48.219" style="s2">it&#39;s like this isn&#39;t this is a place</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.880" end="00:44:49.509" style="s2">where I love that Bill Gates is using</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.219" end="00:44:51.969" style="s2">his money in the way that he is but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.509" end="00:44:56.130" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s an addictive process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.969" end="00:44:56.130" style="s2">still feeding the old the old habits I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.859" end="00:45:00.609" style="s2">I really appreciate that I got to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.599" end="00:45:02.619" style="s2">participate in this guys I have to run</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.609" end="00:45:03.069" style="s2">but I will hopefully see you guys next</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.619" end="00:45:09.369" style="s2">week</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.069" end="00:45:12.130" style="s2">thank you so much all right I&#39;ll get her</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.369" end="00:45:16.029" style="s2">vote later we&#39;ll probably start wrapping</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.130" end="00:45:17.980" style="s2">up in above 5 5 to 7 minutes because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.029" end="00:45:20.559" style="s2">takes us about 10 minutes to go through</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.980" end="00:45:22.239" style="s2">that final thoughts and then we can pick</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.559" end="00:45:26.890" style="s2">the question for next week which will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.239" end="00:45:29.739" style="s2">the last idea cafe for the year I just</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.890" end="00:45:32.769" style="s2">want to jump off David&#39;s point about</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.739" end="00:45:34.900" style="s2">Bill Gates because Bill Gates obviously</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.769" end="00:45:38.230" style="s2">is you don&#39;t give him more than anybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.900" end="00:45:40.900" style="s2">but you know he doesn&#39;t handle critique</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.230" end="00:45:45.789" style="s2">well he doesn&#39;t kind of think about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:50.470" style="s2">bigger big-picture right and you know an</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.789" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">unsecured artist who&#39;s a very very uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.470" end="00:45:56.049" style="s2">out there and popular in the past year</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:58.920" style="s2">and a half to tears with his critique of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.049" end="00:46:01.539" style="s2">corporate philanthropy a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.920" end="00:46:04.359" style="s2">big philanthropists like Bill Gates they</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.539" end="00:46:07.289" style="s2">kind of just dismiss his critique right</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.359" end="00:46:11.289" style="s2">and I think Anand and this approach to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.289" end="00:46:16.180" style="s2">you know realism about philanthropy is</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.289" end="00:46:18.730" style="s2">is 10 times more a game bead and Bill</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.180" end="00:46:20.920" style="s2">Gates or you know whoever could dream of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.730" end="00:46:24.309" style="s2">with with their endeavors right because</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.920" end="00:46:28.630" style="s2">it&#39;s about leverage and and the this</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.309" end="00:46:34.049" style="s2">inordinate amounts of philanthropy in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.630" end="00:46:37.690" style="s2">effect uh it is just you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.049" end="00:46:39.999" style="s2">band-aid solutions to two gaping wounds</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.690" end="00:46:44.380" style="s2">that need to be true to treat it at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.999" end="00:46:47.079" style="s2">wreath at the root level and and so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.380" end="00:46:50.049" style="s2">this is the kind of threshold we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.079" end="00:46:51.549" style="s2">right where where big money doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.049" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">what to do this often ironically Bill</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.549" end="00:46:56.259" style="s2">Gates is someone who does want to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:58.239" style="s2">taxed higher and you know to have more</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.259" end="00:47:00.009" style="s2">of his money kind of in the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.239" end="00:47:03.460" style="s2">hands but but they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.009" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">language to to phrase or to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.460" end="00:47:08.579" style="s2">that transition of giving giving people</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:08.579" style="s2">back the power</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.090" end="00:47:16.410" style="s2">now as we&#39;re kind of comin coming up to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.340" end="00:47:18.600" style="s2">the the end of this what I&#39;d that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.410" end="00:47:21.120" style="s2">thinking about the overall question and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.600" end="00:47:22.590" style="s2">what stops me the more that I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.120" end="00:47:24.420" style="s2">this in the kind of that as I&#39;m framing</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.590" end="00:47:27.840" style="s2">it the recognition is that what stops me</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.420" end="00:47:31.410" style="s2">is the magnitude of the problem like um</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.840" end="00:47:32.700" style="s2">it&#39;s I&#39;ve also often thought it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.410" end="00:47:34.080" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ve often thought that oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.700" end="00:47:35.610" style="s2">there&#39;s something that people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.080" end="00:47:37.470" style="s2">12-step programs gain from being in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.610" end="00:47:38.730" style="s2">12-step program that I don&#39;t have it I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.470" end="00:47:40.860" style="s2">like there to be a 12-step program for</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.730" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">normal people like I think we have an</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.860" end="00:47:45.240" style="s2">opportunity right and 12-step doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:47.850" style="s2">quite do it either 12-step only is</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.240" end="00:47:49.260" style="s2">effective than what 10 to 15 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.850" end="00:47:52.290" style="s2">the people who do that are able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.260" end="00:47:54.870" style="s2">actually manage their abuse and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.290" end="00:47:59.430" style="s2">addiction is that way so we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.870" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">what six times better than been the best</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.430" end="00:48:03.630" style="s2">then one of the best methods out there</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:05.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s for everybody so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.630" end="00:48:07.170" style="s2">something in this that really I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.460" end="00:48:08.910" style="s2">actually excited to buy it it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.170" end="00:48:10.310" style="s2">nervous by thinking what do I need to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.910" end="00:48:14.610" style="s2">to really lean into the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.310" end="00:48:19.380" style="s2">jumping in I think I know listen to</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.610" end="00:48:25.500" style="s2">Karen Brewer on what&#39;s the lesson be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.380" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">ra d Karen okay are en she is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.500" end="00:48:32.610" style="s2">physicist and she said we can&#39;t be in a</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.610" end="00:48:39.660" style="s2">same time but we can be in one or the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:42.750" style="s2">other I think this is good you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.660" end="00:48:45.390" style="s2">sound crazy but we have to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.750" end="00:48:47.310" style="s2">be in the waveform the people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.390" end="00:48:49.350" style="s2">experience near-death experiences</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.310" end="00:48:52.530" style="s2">I absolutely believe they&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.630" end="00:48:58.590" style="s2">them collapses their waveform and put</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.700" end="00:49:02.430" style="s2">some back into the particle state if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.590" end="00:49:03.330" style="s2">don&#39;t learn that how to change from one</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.430" end="00:49:05.310" style="s2">to the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.330" end="00:49:11.490" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to make it out</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.310" end="00:49:13.650" style="s2">of anything into anything else form is</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.490" end="00:49:15.170" style="s2">that what the liminal be comparative to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.650" end="00:49:18.870" style="s2">the wave form do you think was that</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.170" end="00:49:20.310" style="s2">i I don&#39;t really understand the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.870" end="00:49:22.260" style="s2">difference between subliminal and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.310" end="00:49:25.290" style="s2">luminal I I just</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.260" end="00:49:29.490" style="s2">think there&#39;s one way of knowing and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.290" end="00:49:32.040" style="s2">can control it all by yourself just by</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.490" end="00:49:34.500" style="s2">observing yourself I would I would say</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.040" end="00:49:37.110" style="s2">the liminal is the in-between state like</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.500" end="00:49:39.210" style="s2">I would say liminal is something like if</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.110" end="00:49:41.910" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s something like lucid</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.210" end="00:49:44.850" style="s2">dreaming right it&#39;s the it&#39;s the oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.910" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">aware now now what do I do with this</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.850" end="00:49:51.060" style="s2">awareness it&#39;s um it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:53.160" style="s2">starting point of that but it doesn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.060" end="00:49:55.620" style="s2">think sati I think that sovereign real</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.160" end="00:49:58.110" style="s2">sovereignty practice is learning to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.620" end="00:50:01.050" style="s2">practice heavily while in that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.110" end="00:50:03.960" style="s2">state that&#39;s such an important point</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.050" end="00:50:07.260" style="s2">David because lucid dreaming is actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.960" end="00:50:10.230" style="s2">quite hard it rarely happens by accident</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.260" end="00:50:11.700" style="s2">and it takes a lot of practice and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.230" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">more you practice and more it happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.700" end="00:50:17.700" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the formula to it and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:19.950" style="s2">think that is a good analogy to carry</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.700" end="00:50:21.600" style="s2">over into this conversation because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.950" end="00:50:24.660" style="s2">takes constant practice and and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.600" end="00:50:26.760" style="s2">question is like you just said once you</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.660" end="00:50:29.910" style="s2">have that state what do you do with it</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.760" end="00:50:32.490" style="s2">any menu also kind of are aware that</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.910" end="00:50:35.160" style="s2">it&#39;s fleeting you know like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.490" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">seize it because you might wake up from</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.160" end="00:50:41.790" style="s2">that state and end your and that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:44.700" style="s2">Lippman all in sight mm-hm or you might</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.790" end="00:50:47.010" style="s2">kind of lapse back into into a sleep</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.700" end="00:50:48.990" style="s2">without drinking right and we won&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.010" end="00:50:51.810" style="s2">want to avoid both of those in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.990" end="00:50:57.980" style="s2">context we want to stay on point stay in</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.810" end="00:50:57.980" style="s2">the liminal and crystallize this turn I</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.470" end="00:51:07.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you can stay in that state</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.240" end="00:51:10.170" style="s2">yes what I mean I mean like to honor</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.920" end="00:51:12.870" style="s2">that our brains do need to go through</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.170" end="00:51:15.270" style="s2">all of those states constantly you never</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.870" end="00:51:16.980" style="s2">it like I know enlightenment a thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.270" end="00:51:19.080" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to be able to achieve but</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.980" end="00:51:22.350" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know if there it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.080" end="00:51:23.670" style="s2">a real thing because my my course</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.350" end="00:51:25.500" style="s2">towards that seems to look completely</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.670" end="00:51:27.960" style="s2">different than like I&#39;m not getting more</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.500" end="00:51:30.300" style="s2">Zen I&#39;m not getting more it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.960" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">I&#39;m getting angrier I swear more this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.300" end="00:51:35.410" style="s2">like not the normal edit a mountaintop</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:37.540" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.410" end="00:51:40.060" style="s2">I just read an article that your brain</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.540" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t store memories it is memories</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.060" end="00:51:45.400" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing everything you do in</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:48.670" style="s2">life is constructing that memory and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.400" end="00:51:52.390" style="s2">keeping that memory by yourself for</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.670" end="00:51:55.390" style="s2">yourself and Brett what you said about</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.390" end="00:51:59.350" style="s2">have to be loosened you can be still in</p>

<p begin="00:52:11.260" end="00:52:17.560" style="s2">actually 30 days in the past I&#39;ve tested</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.640" end="00:52:19.900" style="s2">that myself on a poster that everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.560" end="00:52:22.600" style="s2">and nobody pays attention to it but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.900" end="00:52:25.090" style="s2">brain actually takes 30 earth days to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.600" end="00:52:31.630" style="s2">film the memory of the exact moment of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.090" end="00:52:35.500" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking right now sorry say</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.630" end="00:52:38.350" style="s2">that need to say that again it takes 30</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.500" end="00:52:40.330" style="s2">days to complete the memory of something</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.350" end="00:52:43.720" style="s2">that happens so well I don&#39;t have a full</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.330" end="00:52:45.880" style="s2">memory of what well here&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.720" end="00:52:48.910" style="s2">experiment that I did it was in future</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:52.330" style="s2">memory by a PMH Atwater and it was James</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.910" end="00:52:55.510" style="s2">my neighbor he&#39;s experiment you practice</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.330" end="00:52:57.940" style="s2">knowing things don&#39;t give yourself any</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.510" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">limits just keep practicing this little</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.940" end="00:53:03.250" style="s2">stupid exercise and I did it for about a</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:06.730" style="s2">week and then the exercise ended and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.250" end="00:53:11.230" style="s2">drew a picture in pencil on an 8 8 and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.730" end="00:53:15.670" style="s2">half by 11 translucent typewriter paper</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.230" end="00:53:18.730" style="s2">that picture showed up 30 days later at</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.670" end="00:53:23.140" style="s2">a Verizon meeting on the Internet this</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.730" end="00:53:26.200" style="s2">was like 1995 or something but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.140" end="00:53:29.410" style="s2">mirror image exact mirror image that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.200" end="00:53:32.860" style="s2">drew 30 days beyond because the earth</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.410" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">took the earth is a time well it slows</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.860" end="00:53:39.070" style="s2">down time like Einstein said it takes 30</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">days for the earth to go 50 million</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.070" end="00:53:47.050" style="s2">miles through space it is very different</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:48.820" style="s2">you know the settings but light even in</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.050" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">our cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.820" end="00:53:53.620" style="s2">travels at the speed of light that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:55.990" style="s2">sign said but if there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.620" end="00:53:59.620" style="s2">multiverse where there&#39;s no speed limit</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.990" end="00:54:03.160" style="s2">so everything that we experience happens</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.620" end="00:54:06.250" style="s2">instantly but it takes us our brain 30</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.160" end="00:54:08.650" style="s2">days to make a movie to show us all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.250" end="00:54:10.270" style="s2">details of it because it&#39;s a like John</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.650" end="00:54:14.020" style="s2">Burke you said it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.270" end="00:54:16.030" style="s2">complicated to look at just one scene</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.020" end="00:54:17.560" style="s2">this conversation now happened 30 days</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.030" end="00:54:19.000" style="s2">ago is what you&#39;re saying and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.560" end="00:54:21.100" style="s2">putting it together in my mind now is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.000" end="00:54:23.020" style="s2">that is that we were saying no my brain</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.100" end="00:54:26.500" style="s2">is too stupid to know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.020" end="00:54:30.190" style="s2">happening right now it it happened 30</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.500" end="00:54:32.470" style="s2">days ago I&#39;m just putting it I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.190" end="00:54:34.870" style="s2">I&#39;m just finishing the Edit now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.470" end="00:54:37.240" style="s2">thing yeah your brain is yeah the brain</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.870" end="00:54:40.060" style="s2">is your movie constructor director</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.240" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">producer and hope it I&#39;ve never heard</p>

<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">quite fun what&#39;s really indeed it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.190" end="00:54:51.970" style="s2">scary as hell I never did it again I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:55.000" style="s2">gay I would say it reminds me of Rupert</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.000" end="00:55:00.190" style="s2">that it&#39;s that it has like our there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.610" end="00:55:01.780" style="s2">way of knowing that&#39;s deeper than us</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.190" end="00:55:04.630" style="s2">thinking we understand something and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.780" end="00:55:06.730" style="s2">there is something like the more these</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.630" end="00:55:08.290" style="s2">conversations I have the easier it is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.730" end="00:55:10.300" style="s2">have these conversations with people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.290" end="00:55:11.890" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard of a verb a key and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.300" end="00:55:13.630" style="s2">finding that there are people like oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.890" end="00:55:14.770" style="s2">you know when I first started watching</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.630" end="00:55:16.840" style="s2">for Vicki I couldn&#39;t have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.770" end="00:55:18.460" style="s2">with a single person and as we started</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.840" end="00:55:20.110" style="s2">watch parties and started discussing it</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.460" end="00:55:21.160" style="s2">and broadening it now I start something</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.110" end="00:55:22.720" style="s2">with somebody goes oh yeah I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.160" end="00:55:24.340" style="s2">thinking about the same thing it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:55:24.340" end="00:55:30.790" style="s2">it&#39;s just like coming to me so there is</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.590" end="00:55:32.530" style="s2">something like the 100th monkey I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.270" end="00:55:38.350" style="s2">there&#39;s something in the turning point</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.490" end="00:55:41.050" style="s2">you know why it is that only 10% of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.350" end="00:55:42.670" style="s2">population needs to really flip my my</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.050" end="00:55:46.780" style="s2">thought is I really want to have some</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.670" end="00:55:48.310" style="s2">sort of wisdom cultivation laboratories</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.310" end="00:55:51.640" style="s2">everybody&#39;s putting together is is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.170" end="00:55:53.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay how do we do deep</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.640" end="00:55:53.890" style="s2">practice in a way that supports each</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.410" end="00:55:56.550" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.890" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">allows us to not ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.550" end="00:55:59.560" style="s2">deepen the practice to make it easier</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:01.240" style="s2">for other people and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.560" end="00:56:02.510" style="s2">Anthony what you&#39;re saying is that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.240" end="00:56:05.990" style="s2">more we do that the easy</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.510" end="00:56:08.540" style="s2">accountant yeah well I just accepted it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.990" end="00:56:11.270" style="s2">like I said it&#39;s scary as no I never did</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.540" end="00:56:13.510" style="s2">it again but I&#39;d never questioned that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.270" end="00:56:13.510" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.570" end="00:56:18.650" style="s2">we&#39;re at the really at the ends of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.970" end="00:56:21.490" style="s2">conversations you&#39;re gonna need to wrap</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.650" end="00:56:23.660" style="s2">it up which is always hard for us I know</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.490" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">so if anyone would like to give some</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.660" end="00:56:30.260" style="s2">closing closing thoughts Eric can do his</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:31.310" style="s2">closing thoughts later my closing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.260" end="00:56:32.810" style="s2">thoughts I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.310" end="00:56:34.550" style="s2">whole lot more than I did I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.810" end="00:56:36.890" style="s2">I&#39;m really excited about it right now I</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.550" end="00:56:39.770" style="s2">think that I feel like I&#39;m every day</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.890" end="00:56:42.770" style="s2">leaning into leaning into the uphill of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.770" end="00:56:46.370" style="s2">the game be more so I&#39;ll use the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.770" end="00:56:48.830" style="s2">metaphor to say that doing so feels more</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.370" end="00:56:59.170" style="s2">like an enjoyable practice rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.830" end="00:57:01.720" style="s2">terrible chore all right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.170" end="00:57:04.400" style="s2">but else fun do their closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.720" end="00:57:06.260" style="s2">just very very quickly I thought Brent&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.400" end="00:57:07.850" style="s2">modification of the question to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.260" end="00:57:09.430" style="s2">break it into two parts you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.850" end="00:57:11.840" style="s2">holding me back what&#39;s holding us</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.430" end="00:57:14.630" style="s2">collectively back is a very useful</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.840" end="00:57:17.000" style="s2">distinction and as he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.630" end="00:57:18.470" style="s2">that the idea of the Nash equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.000" end="00:57:20.300" style="s2">popped into my mind you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.470" end="00:57:23.180" style="s2">that however good the alternative is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.300" end="00:57:24.980" style="s2">until until there are enough people</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.180" end="00:57:26.660" style="s2">willing to step over the line and be</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.980" end="00:57:28.820" style="s2">seen to step over the line by everybody</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.660" end="00:57:31.550" style="s2">else then nobody steps over the line you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.820" end="00:57:33.470" style="s2">know and so I think that&#39;s a huge thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.550" end="00:57:35.780" style="s2">of what holds us back that men tell you</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.470" end="00:57:38.230" style="s2">know that sort of herd mentality a lack</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.780" end="00:57:40.490" style="s2">of individual sovereignty and a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.230" end="00:57:42.560" style="s2">individuals willing to take that step on</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.490" end="00:57:44.780" style="s2">their own you know what I mean I and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.560" end="00:57:47.480" style="s2">thereby show the way I think that could</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.780" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">be could be a something yeah that whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.480" end="00:57:52.970" style="s2">that whole topics I just mentioned about</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:55.910" style="s2">time it&#39;s a it&#39;s a topic on the game be</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.970" end="00:57:57.860" style="s2">Facebook group so you can everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.910" end="00:58:01.270" style="s2">that I know about it is there so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.860" end="00:58:04.790" style="s2">really don&#39;t have anything to add to it</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.270" end="00:58:05.900" style="s2">thank you right gonna give some a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.790" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">closing statement</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.900" end="00:58:15.950" style="s2">oh sure I&#39;ll just say let&#39;s keep working</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:16.369" style="s2">on those left turns David&#39;s right of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.950" end="00:58:19.160" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.369" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">sense that you know you don&#39;t regardless</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.160" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">of what happens there&#39;s there&#39;s parallel</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:26.630" style="s2">movements that are post political and we</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:30.170" style="s2">need to focus on those but I do think a</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.630" end="00:58:33.259" style="s2">very strongly that a lot of our ideas</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.170" end="00:58:35.299" style="s2">and our movement dovetails with current</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.259" end="00:58:38.509" style="s2">vanguard Left movements and thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.299" end="00:58:40.069" style="s2">policies that are going to enable what</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.509" end="00:58:41.900" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about it&#39;s going to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.069" end="00:58:43.759" style="s2">it a lot easier you know do you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.900" end="00:58:46.519" style="s2">what what kind of leadership do you want</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.759" end="00:58:48.230" style="s2">to pursue these things under what type</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.519" end="00:58:52.670" style="s2">of people do you want to work with right</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.230" end="00:58:55.819" style="s2">because you know by and large the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.670" end="00:58:58.569" style="s2">emergent new left is is leading the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.819" end="00:59:02.089" style="s2">you know things like the green New Deal</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.569" end="00:59:03.799" style="s2">are you know they&#39;re criticized for many</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.089" end="00:59:07.519" style="s2">angles but when you really get into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.799" end="00:59:11.450" style="s2">weeds it&#39;s quite substantive and it</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.519" end="00:59:14.059" style="s2">addresses a lot of these systemic of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.450" end="00:59:18.200" style="s2">blocks that prevent us from working</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.059" end="00:59:20.989" style="s2">together on these big issues right</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.200" end="00:59:22.789" style="s2">thanks Brent I don&#39;t know if any closing</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.989" end="00:59:24.769" style="s2">thoughts per se except that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.789" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">talking about dreams and dream states of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.769" end="00:59:29.480" style="s2">this personal I&#39;ve always been good at</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:31.220" style="s2">lucid dreaming I don&#39;t know if you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.480" end="00:59:33.380" style="s2">be good at it I&#39;ve always been able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.220" end="00:59:35.749" style="s2">access lucid dreaming but I&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.380" end="00:59:37.940" style="s2">ability to control my dreams mid</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.749" end="00:59:40.759" style="s2">childhood where I can&#39;t fly because I</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.940" end="00:59:42.799" style="s2">know it&#39;s not possible and so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.759" end="00:59:44.869" style="s2">control it I can&#39;t be aware I&#39;m dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.799" end="00:59:46.460" style="s2">and do that at the same time and at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.869" end="00:59:48.109" style="s2">same time now that I&#39;m in adults and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.460" end="00:59:49.549" style="s2">at the process where I might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.109" end="00:59:52.069" style="s2">get some of that back some of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.549" end="00:59:55.880" style="s2">control of the dream I&#39;m mature enough</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.069" end="00:59:57.619" style="s2">to want it to be what it is to be like</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.880" end="00:59:59.539" style="s2">if you&#39;re teaching me if you&#39;re here to</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.539" end="01:00:03.019" style="s2">teach me then why would I control it</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.220" end="01:00:04.400" style="s2">when it&#39;s supposed to be like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.019" end="01:00:06.619" style="s2">supposed to be part of that movie and</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.400" end="01:00:09.109" style="s2">I&#39;m learning from it and that is for me</p>
