<p begin="00:00:24.510" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">interesting than any movie he&#39;s ever</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">Fitzcarraldo he says if nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">it&#39;s a story about a man so possessed by</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:04.229" style="s2">an IDI fix that he drags a boat over a</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">whole thing sounded incredibly mad and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:12.990" style="s2">in fact what was so interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:15.450" style="s2">this film was is that the director</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.990" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">actually had to do in real life what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.450" end="00:01:21.150" style="s2">crazy fictional character did inside of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">the storyline this led me to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.150" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">fascination with today&#39;s interview</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">subject Verner Hertzog this is a man who</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">has lived so richly and so profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">that I actually started to get a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">different idea about what he was doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">as a filmmaker the idea that I could not</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:42.180" style="s2">shake was as that Verner Hertzog needed</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">to live so deeply and so profoundly that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.180" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">he had to make movies simply to justify</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">what it meant to be Verner Hertzog now</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">I&#39;ve often asked myself this question</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">what is it the great generals do between</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">wars it&#39;s hard to imagine let&#39;s say a</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.590" end="00:02:11.810" style="s2">to win in such a situation I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.950" end="00:02:13.459" style="s2">very hard to come up with an answer but</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.810" end="00:02:16.060" style="s2">I think that the best answer that I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.459" end="00:02:18.370" style="s2">is that these people would make movies</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.540" end="00:03:42.739" style="s2">worldview and you could probably spot it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.750" end="00:03:45.950" style="s2">very very quickly if you walked into a</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.950" end="00:03:51.650" style="s2">was a film within and and you didn&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:18.919" style="s2">very struck by which is what we all get</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.739" end="00:04:21.590" style="s2">wrong about Verner Hertzog and</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.060" end="00:04:40.159" style="s2">what it was that those stories might</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.129" end="00:04:41.900" style="s2">cover up as if sort of cheap icing on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.159" end="00:04:44.659" style="s2">very rich cake and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.900" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">that I saw was what and correct me if</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.659" end="00:04:48.949" style="s2">I&#39;m wrong it seems like you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:51.740" style="s2">tremendous concern for the people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.949" end="00:04:54.259" style="s2">you bring out on to these crazy projects</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.259" end="00:05:01.699" style="s2">getting that wrong no we shouldn&#39;t waste</p>

<p begin="00:05:01.699" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">about me it doesn&#39;t really matter let</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.620" end="00:05:10.969" style="s2">them be wrong mm-hmm but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">things that comes up quite often seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.969" end="00:05:18.050" style="s2">to be an identification of the creator</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.349" end="00:06:15.819" style="s2">course he had it a part of being a an</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.949" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2">so but otherwise he was the mildest I</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.419" end="00:06:30.540" style="s2">could express would be he was the</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.460" end="00:07:35.160" style="s2">away screaming out I mean at a complete</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:38.820" style="s2">not not just a tantrum it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.160" end="00:07:41.850" style="s2">just an an outburst of Rage because his</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.820" end="00:07:44.460" style="s2">coffee was lukewarm and he stormed at</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.850" end="00:07:46.830" style="s2">the place where we were checking on on</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.460" end="00:07:49.170" style="s2">the radio and trying to figure out and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.830" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2">he kept screaming and screaming I could</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.170" end="00:07:53.940" style="s2">not calm him down I could not get him</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:57.720" style="s2">away I tried to tell him there&#39;s a plane</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.720" end="00:08:04.650" style="s2">listen to to what has happened it</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.920" end="00:08:07.170" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t help at all I would scream and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.650" end="00:08:11.730" style="s2">he would scream he could scream a glass</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.170" end="00:08:15.990" style="s2">into he could shatter a glass of wine</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.730" end="00:08:21.060" style="s2">glass he it really a minute I do not</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.990" end="00:08:23.670" style="s2">exaggerate and so the only reason the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.060" end="00:08:26.070" style="s2">only way I could after an hour and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.670" end="00:08:29.400" style="s2">half when he had already froth a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:31.860" style="s2">hardened froth at his at his mouth I</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.400" end="00:08:35.280" style="s2">went to my heart and I had a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.860" end="00:08:37.740" style="s2">piece of Swiss chocolate left which I</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.280" end="00:08:41.610" style="s2">people would murder for a search of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.740" end="00:08:43.530" style="s2">treasure in our camp and I stepped in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.610" end="00:08:43.979" style="s2">front of him and and ate this chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.530" end="00:08:46.889" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.979" end="00:08:49.230" style="s2">that silenced him there was that there</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.889" end="00:08:50.970" style="s2">was something which was stunning and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.230" end="00:08:51.720" style="s2">knew you intuited that this would have</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.970" end="00:08:54.750" style="s2">that effect</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">I should have have the intuition after</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.750" end="00:09:02.579" style="s2">five minutes it took over an hour so but</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:05.910" style="s2">probably Mei said quite often qualities</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.579" end="00:09:09.389" style="s2">of the characters in my films have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.910" end="00:09:12.930" style="s2">superimposed on my on my own character</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.389" end="00:09:15.810" style="s2">for example I&#39;ve acted in some Hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.930" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">films and some independent films Jack</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.810" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">Reacher for example and I&#39;m playing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:26.850" style="s2">real real dangerous badass bad guy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:28.500" style="s2">and I am very very dangerous in the head</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.850" end="00:09:31.829" style="s2">- and I&#39;m unarmed</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.500" end="00:09:35.339" style="s2">and I have no fingers left and and I am</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.829" end="00:09:40.079" style="s2">blind on one eye and and yet I had to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.339" end="00:09:42.769" style="s2">spread terror from the screen and I did</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.079" end="00:09:45.029" style="s2">it so well I did it so well that my</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.769" end="00:09:49.319" style="s2">reviews were much better than the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.029" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">reviews for Tom Cruise now it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.319" end="00:09:56.699" style="s2">it&#39;s I&#39;m not exaggerating I was good but</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:10:00.589" style="s2">it not that I can say this kind of vile</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.699" end="00:10:05.130" style="s2">dangerous character is really in me</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.589" end="00:10:07.889" style="s2">really and it came very easy I did it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.130" end="00:10:10.230" style="s2">unprepared you see and I have learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.889" end="00:10:12.449" style="s2">that when we did Fitzcarraldo in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.230" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">first round of shooting there was Mick</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.449" end="00:10:17.370" style="s2">Jagger as a sidekick of the leading</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:20.100" style="s2">character in Jagger&#39;s spend some six</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.370" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">weeks with us in the Changi we shot half</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.100" end="00:10:25.649" style="s2">the film had to stop because the leading</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">character became ill we had to send him</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.649" end="00:10:31.019" style="s2">to the States and the doctors wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:33.149" style="s2">allow him to return to the journey so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.019" end="00:10:36.089" style="s2">knew I had to start all over again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.149" end="00:10:38.310" style="s2">on Jagger&#39;s contract mmm there was no</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.089" end="00:10:40.680" style="s2">time enough left for doing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.310" end="00:10:47.250" style="s2">film all over I shot the film actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.680" end="00:10:53.089" style="s2">one and a half times and what what what</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.250" end="00:10:56.279" style="s2">is strange about this recasting and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.089" end="00:10:57.450" style="s2">restarting the whole thing I knew if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.279" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">did not find</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.450" end="00:11:03.630" style="s2">acta quickly in such a case I had no</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:06.270" style="s2">alternative but playing the part may</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.630" end="00:11:08.910" style="s2">myself because I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.270" end="00:11:12.150" style="s2">credible and I would have been good not</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.910" end="00:11:15.930" style="s2">as good as let&#39;s say Mick Jagger and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.150" end="00:11:18.150" style="s2">Jason Robards or Kinski and I learned</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.930" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">one thing from from Mick Jagger which</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.150" end="00:11:24.180" style="s2">astonished me</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:29.700" style="s2">he took me once backstage when they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.180" end="00:11:33.030" style="s2">recording and I was there and and he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.700" end="00:11:35.820" style="s2">arguing with somebody about some totally</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.030" end="00:11:40.710" style="s2">trivial things completely and utterly</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.820" end="00:11:44.400" style="s2">trivial things and also on my set he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.710" end="00:11:47.070" style="s2">arguing about the mineral water about</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.400" end="00:11:49.860" style="s2">the per diem or something and I said to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.070" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">him make the cameras rolling and he</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.860" end="00:11:56.610" style="s2">looked at me and he sees we are already</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:59.880" style="s2">doing it and he steps three steps in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.610" end="00:12:04.460" style="s2">front of the camera and within three</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.880" end="00:12:08.430" style="s2">steps he becomes a demon from a trivial</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.460" end="00:12:11.280" style="s2">trivial little bickering mediocre kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.430" end="00:12:15.030" style="s2">of character he steps in front and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.280" end="00:12:19.080" style="s2">a demon and and that&#39;s in in a way I</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.030" end="00:12:21.930" style="s2">learned that from him and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.080" end="00:12:25.230" style="s2">prepare myself I when I stepped in front</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.930" end="00:12:30.690" style="s2">of the camera I knew there was only one</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.230" end="00:12:33.480" style="s2">thing become and be frightening and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.690" end="00:12:35.490" style="s2">can do it yeah and I would accept it</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.480" end="00:12:39.470" style="s2">only because I knew I could do it so</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.490" end="00:12:39.470" style="s2">you&#39;re really not the ultimate badass</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.590" end="00:12:46.890" style="s2">because I can&#39;t maybe I am but</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.290" end="00:12:48.810" style="s2">unbeknownst to me well okay if it feels</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.890" end="00:12:51.180" style="s2">to me like I was just watching video</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.810" end="00:12:54.930" style="s2">view video of you being interviewed by</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.180" end="00:12:57.150" style="s2">the BBC and him probably you&#39;re shot in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.930" end="00:12:59.220" style="s2">the abdomen while being interviewed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.150" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">you seem to be somewhat type yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.220" end="00:13:05.310" style="s2">somewhat irritated that the interviewer</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:06.780" style="s2">is treating this as a big deal and like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.310" end="00:13:08.640" style="s2">this otherwise that how would I know</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.780" end="00:13:11.420" style="s2">that you wear Paisley underwear I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.640" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">you take your your pay</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.420" end="00:13:15.570" style="s2">when you&#39;re bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:17.460" style="s2">oh yeah and you&#39;re treated like why is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.570" end="00:13:20.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not that big of a bullet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.460" end="00:13:22.080" style="s2">that was your ad no I actually I said</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.010" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">something more beautiful I said this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.080" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">an insignificant poorest ruler and and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:32.460" style="s2">knew it it had not perforated everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">it went through my jacket in the catalog</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.460" end="00:13:38.220" style="s2">in the pocket and everything but didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:42.150" style="s2">perforate into my intestine so that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.220" end="00:13:46.230" style="s2">insignificant but they immediately hit</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.150" end="00:13:48.960" style="s2">the hit the the the the ground the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.230" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">camera flat and I hate the feeling stay</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.960" end="00:13:54.210" style="s2">let&#39;s finish at least the center this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:56.640" style="s2">great video I mean what they admit was</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.210" end="00:13:58.740" style="s2">great video it would have been but but</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.640" end="00:14:01.110" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to suggest sir is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.740" end="00:14:04.500" style="s2">you are the unreliable narrator you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.110" end="00:14:06.840" style="s2">at no no no I made sense no no no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.500" end="00:14:09.690" style="s2">the one who makes sense I&#39;m the one who</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.840" end="00:14:11.820" style="s2">puts order into a chaotic situation</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.690" end="00:14:13.560" style="s2">that&#39;s what you did but when I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.820" end="00:14:15.990" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is is that when your</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.560" end="00:14:17.790" style="s2">autonomic nervous system is is triggered</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.990" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">it barely registers you&#39;ve been shot in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.790" end="00:14:22.770" style="s2">the abdomen it&#39;s registered it hurt it</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:26.250" style="s2">read it threat a year because when I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.770" end="00:14:29.100" style="s2">laughing hard it was still hurting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.250" end="00:14:31.410" style="s2">yes but there&#39;s a sense of duty then why</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.100" end="00:14:31.950" style="s2">I very much appreciate but that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.410" end="00:14:34.650" style="s2">unusual</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.950" end="00:14:37.620" style="s2">the deserve yes but it&#39;s part of being a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.650" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">good soldier of cinema that I try to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.620" end="00:14:45.270" style="s2">with a sense of duty a sense of you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:48.570" style="s2">to be reliably you have to hold an</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.270" end="00:14:51.720" style="s2">outpost that others have given up its</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.570" end="00:14:54.450" style="s2">loyalty its and its loyalty to the</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.450" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">they argued we should call the police</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:02.610" style="s2">right away and I said let&#39;s not do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:05.940" style="s2">because do you want to spend the next</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.610" end="00:15:08.460" style="s2">six hours in in a police station to file</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.289" end="00:18:16.570" style="s2">because I told him and he didn&#39;t hear it</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.279" end="00:18:19.330" style="s2">apparently I told him Christian you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.570" end="00:18:23.139" style="s2">what you stop eating when you really</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.330" end="00:18:25.450" style="s2">have when you had it and he keep eating</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.139" end="00:18:28.779" style="s2">eating eating until the plate is empty</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.450" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">and then I say cut and he said why</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.779" end="00:18:33.669" style="s2">didn&#39;t you say cut before why what what</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">happened and I said Christian you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.669" end="00:18:38.230" style="s2">the one who should have cut said cuts</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.830" end="00:18:43.570" style="s2">but he didn&#39;t hear it and he was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.230" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">miffed but but those those moments say</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.570" end="00:18:51.940" style="s2">they do happen ment and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:56.350" style="s2">unexpected on on a set that&#39;s movies</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.940" end="00:18:58.749" style="s2">yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.350" end="00:19:01.019" style="s2">that I guess those moments do happen so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.749" end="00:19:02.710" style="s2">it does strike me though that but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.019" end="00:19:04.990" style="s2">tested it first</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.710" end="00:19:07.990" style="s2">but you see would do that always test it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.990" end="00:19:09.519" style="s2">first seems like that&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.990" end="00:19:11.950" style="s2">Israelis have a theory of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.519" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">which is called follow me where they</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.749" end="00:19:23.230" style="s2">morale of the troops is so much</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.730" end="00:19:25.570" style="s2">heightened when when you see a leader</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.230" end="00:19:28.440" style="s2">saying I will actually take that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.570" end="00:19:30.659" style="s2">a risk that seems to be a part of a yes</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.669" end="00:19:41.139" style="s2">soldiers he would not ride on his horse</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.529" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">he would be on foot thousands of miles</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.139" end="00:19:48.639" style="s2">he would be the first to to climb the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:49.790" style="s2">ramparts on a ladder he would be the one</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.790" end="00:19:56.460" style="s2">thirsty and and almost dying from thirst</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.190" end="00:20:00.060" style="s2">one soldier collected a helmet full of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.460" end="00:20:02.670" style="s2">what a bit by bit drop by drop and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.060" end="00:20:06.180" style="s2">when the thirst was at his worst this</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.180" end="00:20:13.080" style="s2">of Alexander and says I saved this for</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.790" end="00:20:16.170" style="s2">you drink this and Alexander looks at it</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.080" end="00:20:19.890" style="s2">and spills it away and he says too much</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.170" end="00:20:23.970" style="s2">for one too little for all in marches on</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.890" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s leadership or Hannibal who</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.970" end="00:20:30.510" style="s2">crossed the Alps on elephants he would</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:35.480" style="s2">sleep with his soldiers at the outpost</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.510" end="00:20:39.780" style="s2">wrapped in his in his coat and he would</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.780" end="00:20:47.100" style="s2">south of the Alps and he would do things</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.600" end="00:20:51.570" style="s2">that nobody else in his army would ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.100" end="00:20:53.880" style="s2">do do you feel that this aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.570" end="00:20:58.430" style="s2">leadership of putting oneself in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.880" end="00:21:01.500" style="s2">greatest situations of risk and harm is</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.430" end="00:21:04.620" style="s2">no you avoid harm if possible of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.500" end="00:21:07.740" style="s2">but you eliminate harm before it even</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.620" end="00:21:11.250" style="s2">appears you see you have to be prudent</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.740" end="00:21:15.210" style="s2">and in any kind of business including</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.250" end="00:21:18.870" style="s2">the business of warfare you you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.210" end="00:21:23.070" style="s2">evaluate a situation and you have to try</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.070" end="00:21:31.310" style="s2">leader and in the troop you better stay</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:34.800" style="s2">out of it and you you use all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.310" end="00:21:40.140" style="s2">military tricked trickery deceit right</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.800" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">you use ambushes you use the so called</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.140" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">cowardly things and before you really</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:51.810" style="s2">put anyone into a very grave danger</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:54.650" style="s2">eliminate whatever you can sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.810" end="00:21:59.070" style="s2">can&#39;t eliminate everything but cheat</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.650" end="00:22:01.800" style="s2">source of course a large and lying</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.070" end="00:22:03.130" style="s2">I liked by the way it comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.800" end="00:22:06.070" style="s2">Jesse Ventura</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.130" end="00:22:08.380" style="s2">who used to be a bodyguard of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.070" end="00:22:12.820" style="s2">Rolling Stones by the way and he used to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.380" end="00:22:14.910" style="s2">be a studio wrestler who played that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.820" end="00:22:17.980" style="s2">bad guy by the way in the ring</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.910" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">completely stylist and he became</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.980" end="00:22:24.039" style="s2">governor of Minnesota and I always liked</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:28.090" style="s2">him for his down-to-earth approach and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.039" end="00:22:30.610" style="s2">he said once about his time in the ring</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.090" end="00:22:36.220" style="s2">as a restless as one of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.610" end="00:22:41.350" style="s2">WrestleMania people and he said when if</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.220" end="00:22:48.870" style="s2">you can lose if you must but always</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.350" end="00:22:51.190" style="s2">cheat so I really like him for that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.870" end="00:22:53.830" style="s2">so this is one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.190" end="00:22:58.110" style="s2">found most endearing about your approach</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.830" end="00:23:00.700" style="s2">is that you teach film in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.110" end="00:23:02.710" style="s2">completely different fashion it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.700" end="00:23:05.169" style="s2">let&#39;s be honest you&#39;re an outlaw before</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.580" end="00:23:21.669" style="s2">have stolen once in a while but more</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.049" end="00:23:24.039" style="s2">expropriation than stealing then theft</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.669" end="00:23:28.929" style="s2">like my first camera was expropriated</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.039" end="00:23:33.340" style="s2">from a institution but mmm do anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.929" end="00:23:37.500" style="s2">that&#39;s outside of the legal norms as</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.340" end="00:23:41.710" style="s2">long as it does not hurt anyone and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.500" end="00:23:44.890" style="s2">foraging shooting permit in a country</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.710" end="00:23:46.929" style="s2">that has a military dictatorship ship is</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.940" end="00:25:39.900" style="s2">because they would arrest you or they</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.190" end="00:25:44.450" style="s2">would stop you at least and check you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.900" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">out but if you have 17 18 20 of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.450" end="00:25:50.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a strange psychological reflex</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.059" end="00:27:02.450" style="s2">in our time there&#39;s this mania for truth</p>

<p begin="00:27:09.409" end="00:27:16.249" style="s2">certainly at its cultural low and yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.159" end="00:27:20.059" style="s2">here you are talking to us about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.249" end="00:27:23.509" style="s2">need to deceive to break the law and to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.059" end="00:27:26.389" style="s2">affirm the violent act of creation in a</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.669" end="00:27:36.349" style="s2">risk just too and in part inspire and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.349" end="00:27:38.299" style="s2">and protect your people even you seem to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.349" end="00:27:40.339" style="s2">be a man completely out of out of time</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.299" end="00:27:42.049" style="s2">with the current era and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.339" end="00:27:45.019" style="s2">suit you fine is that wrong not really</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.049" end="00:27:49.070" style="s2">there are few of us but I wish there</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.019" end="00:27:53.479" style="s2">were more hmm but of course what what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.070" end="00:27:55.999" style="s2">are doing in filmmaking is not always</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.479" end="00:27:59.479" style="s2">based on boardroom decision the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.999" end="00:28:01.339" style="s2">we&#39;ve shaped the dialogue today in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.479" end="00:28:04.639" style="s2">Hollywood industry is determined by</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.339" end="00:28:08.239" style="s2">wardrobe decisions and and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.639" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">moviemaking has become so stale and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.239" end="00:28:14.749" style="s2">uninteresting and so predictable so if</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:16.820" style="s2">you do the the most the wildest of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.749" end="00:28:17.929" style="s2">stories and that&#39;s all we said counts</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.820" end="00:28:20.360" style="s2">you see I too</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.929" end="00:28:23.389" style="s2">not step outside the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.360" end="00:28:26.539" style="s2">legality it has to do with with a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.389" end="00:28:29.809" style="s2">caliber of your quest with the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.539" end="00:28:33.649" style="s2">your story with a vision that you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.809" end="00:28:38.749" style="s2">pursuing if that has real real depth and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.649" end="00:28:42.440" style="s2">you know it has enduring depth then you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.749" end="00:28:46.190" style="s2">have you have the task and the duty to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.440" end="00:28:49.789" style="s2">do the things that are necessary as long</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.190" end="00:28:52.490" style="s2">as I said as you do not damage or hurt</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.789" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">anyone know what you are taking a fair</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.490" end="00:28:57.110" style="s2">amount of responsibility we had Jim</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:58.970" style="s2">Watson come to this office and he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.110" end="00:29:00.889" style="s2">he the co-discoverer of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.970" end="00:29:04.789" style="s2">three-dimensional structure of DNA of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.889" end="00:29:07.850" style="s2">Watson yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yes but</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.789" end="00:29:10.100" style="s2">he he said something which was you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.850" end="00:29:12.999" style="s2">I found very disturbing but also very</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.100" end="00:29:15.799" style="s2">sensible he said you&#39;re given about five</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.999" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">opportunities to really level up in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.799" end="00:29:21.169" style="s2">life this was how he saw it and he said</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:23.149" style="s2">you have to take each one of those even</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.169" end="00:29:26.629" style="s2">though sometimes each of them comes with</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.149" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">an opportunity where somebody may be put</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.629" end="00:29:32.330" style="s2">at risk or hurt and I was curious you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:34.940" style="s2">have a very strong relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.330" end="00:29:36.740" style="s2">risk where you&#39;re both putting people at</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.940" end="00:29:39.080" style="s2">risk and trying to make sure you put</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.740" end="00:29:40.580" style="s2">them at risk as little as possible if if</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.080" end="00:29:43.100" style="s2">both of those are true do you believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.580" end="00:29:44.749" style="s2">that let&#39;s say Watson was correct that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.100" end="00:29:46.700" style="s2">you have to take these opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.749" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">even if they do put others at risk or do</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.700" end="00:29:51.220" style="s2">you really have a way no harm well I</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:55.369" style="s2">think it&#39;s more than five opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.220" end="00:29:59.749" style="s2">and you&#39;re these things if I&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.369" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">hundred times this these moments and in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.749" end="00:30:06.259" style="s2">risk-taking per se as now there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:09.830" style="s2">great value it depends on what you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.259" end="00:30:14.299" style="s2">doing and and what kind of purpose he</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.830" end="00:30:18.499" style="s2">serves and it&#39;s not a quality per se to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.299" end="00:30:23.539" style="s2">take risks I try to to avoid risks and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.499" end="00:30:27.490" style="s2">and and you see my proof that I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.539" end="00:30:30.160" style="s2">been prudent circumspect and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.490" end="00:30:34.420" style="s2">well-organized is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.160" end="00:30:38.350" style="s2">over 70 films not a single one of my</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.420" end="00:30:41.580" style="s2">actors ever was hurt not one I was hurt</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.350" end="00:30:44.740" style="s2">sometimes sometimes it has happened that</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.580" end="00:30:47.970" style="s2">some very close collaborator physically</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.740" end="00:30:51.190" style="s2">next to me like a cinematographer with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.970" end="00:30:53.890" style="s2">20 kilo a handheld camera at that time</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.190" end="00:30:56.950" style="s2">heavy flies through the air on the deck</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.890" end="00:30:59.830" style="s2">edge of a ship that bangs into a into a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.950" end="00:31:02.860" style="s2">rock and yes and we were flying some 10</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.830" end="00:31:05.500" style="s2">meters and he bangs with his hand on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.860" end="00:31:09.010" style="s2">on the deck and the camera split his</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.500" end="00:31:11.020" style="s2">hand apart so yes it happens and and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.010" end="00:31:13.030" style="s2">didn&#39;t mind by the way where he</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.020" end="00:31:14.980" style="s2">volunteer dream I write of course use</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.030" end="00:31:15.580" style="s2">every every since that who&#39;s coming with</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.980" end="00:31:20.290" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.580" end="00:31:22.750" style="s2">nobody has to yeah sure and actually in</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.290" end="00:31:26.050" style="s2">this case when we went with cameras</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.750" end="00:31:31.690" style="s2">through the rapids that and we had shot</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.050" end="00:31:33.820" style="s2">the the sequence with cameras on on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.690" end="00:31:36.930" style="s2">shore there&#39;s no real source but in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.820" end="00:31:40.390" style="s2">rocks on either sides of these Rapids I</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.930" end="00:31:42.520" style="s2">was even pushed by some collaborators we</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.390" end="00:31:45.970" style="s2">should have a camera on board I said</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.520" end="00:31:47.950" style="s2">really yes of course I see that but but</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.970" end="00:31:50.920" style="s2">we do not know what&#39;s gonna happen it</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.950" end="00:31:54.060" style="s2">may sink what happens then it the ship</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.920" end="00:31:58.090" style="s2">probably is not gonna sink because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.060" end="00:32:01.690" style="s2">established it with a lot of very very</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.370" end="00:32:14.500" style="s2">very difficult question that assume that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.950" end="00:32:17.140" style="s2">you were trying to make Fitzcarraldo in</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.500" end="00:32:21.010" style="s2">which you drag this in steamer over a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.140" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">mountain and it&#39;s not the year 1982 but</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.010" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">it&#39;s some year maybe around now maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:27.670" style="s2">few years in the future where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:29.620" style="s2">possible to do this completely with</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.670" end="00:32:32.650" style="s2">computer-generated imagery so that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.620" end="00:32:36.100" style="s2">could do it in CGI now my question would</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.650" end="00:32:40.630" style="s2">be this would if it produced the same</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.350" end="00:32:50.139" style="s2">no it doesn&#39;t mmm it doesn&#39;t create the</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.129" end="00:33:05.860" style="s2">know it I don&#39;t think that digital</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.009" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">effects will ever create some sort of an</p>

<p begin="00:34:59.470" end="00:35:03.490" style="s2">professional wrestling is a lot more</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.829" end="00:35:11.349" style="s2">one interpretation of your work sir is</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.680" end="00:35:13.210" style="s2">that you are making many more</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.349" end="00:35:14.950" style="s2">documentaries than you claim to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.210" end="00:35:17.440" style="s2">because in fact in something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.950" end="00:35:19.329" style="s2">Fitzcarraldo it&#39;s a fictional story</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.440" end="00:35:21.790" style="s2">about a man moving a ship over a</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.770" end="00:35:28.390" style="s2">remember when it came out in 1982 my I</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.020" end="00:35:31.869" style="s2">was in college we were electrified by</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.390" end="00:35:33.819" style="s2">this concept then if he had been done in</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.869" end="00:35:35.410" style="s2">CGI and we had known that it would been</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.819" end="00:35:37.210" style="s2">in CGI we would not have been that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.410" end="00:35:39.910" style="s2">interested in the story but it was the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.210" end="00:35:41.799" style="s2">fact that there was an insane man moving</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.910" end="00:35:44.859" style="s2">a ship over a mountain in reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.799" end="00:35:46.839" style="s2">clinically sane man 2050 sorry fair</p>

<p begin="00:35:46.839" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">necessity aspersions yeah but but</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.210" end="00:35:54.369" style="s2">functionally sir it&#39;s a it is a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:57.579" style="s2">quest and you and you spoke about it no</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.369" end="00:35:59.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not a crazy crazy those terms no no</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.579" end="00:36:02.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not a crazy quest it was doable</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.559" end="00:36:07.319" style="s2">yeah and you and I to the to it&#39;ll yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.950" end="00:36:11.049" style="s2">you see you to not go out and and try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.319" end="00:36:14.349" style="s2">let&#39;s say go to Mars and spend there</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.049" end="00:36:17.470" style="s2">half a year on Morrison and coveri and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.349" end="00:36:21.480" style="s2">getting footage you you will fail it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.470" end="00:36:24.250" style="s2">not gonna work and we will see the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.480" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">technological utopias coming to an end</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.250" end="00:36:31.140" style="s2">in our very century well you know as</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:33.849" style="s2">various entry like we saw social utopias</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.140" end="00:36:34.660" style="s2">coming to an inevitable end in the last</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.359" end="00:36:51.940" style="s2">the to a bland I knew it was doable</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.220" end="00:36:56.200" style="s2">because I had figured out how to move a</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.460" end="00:37:03.819" style="s2">Neolithic peoples would say more about</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.380" end="00:37:07.060" style="s2">how you solve that you saw that as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.819" end="00:37:09.370" style="s2">puzzle I was searching</p>

<p begin="00:37:49.570" end="00:37:58.420" style="s2">been only alien astronauts and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.400" end="00:38:03.190" style="s2">nel I can let I will not move from</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.420" end="00:38:06.040" style="s2">this place until I as a Neolithic person</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.190" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">could do it so what I would do is let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.630" end="00:38:40.540" style="s2">would move then I would move the the</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.080" end="00:41:54.920" style="s2">it&#39;s called The Vanishing Area paradox I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.890" end="00:41:58.990" style="s2">keep it in my agenda all the time and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.920" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">was published in the Scientific American</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.990" end="00:42:06.470" style="s2">and it&#39;s very strange you have you have</p>

<p begin="00:42:06.470" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">and when you rearrange the configuration</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.220" end="00:42:15.710" style="s2">of these all of a sudden there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:19.060" style="s2">empty space of something that has filled</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.710" end="00:42:22.460" style="s2">out the entire space without a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.060" end="00:42:26.080" style="s2">millimeter in between and I kept</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.460" end="00:42:31.400" style="s2">thinking about it because it defies all</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.080" end="00:42:33.890" style="s2">my experience with reality so within my</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.400" end="00:42:36.710" style="s2">reality it is unthinkably it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.890" end="00:42:39.560" style="s2">impossible so and I kept thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.710" end="00:42:42.440" style="s2">it and and I was misled the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.560" end="00:42:47.450" style="s2">is a hoax it turns out it&#39;s a hoax</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.440" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s fraudulent and it gives it a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.450" end="00:42:55.460" style="s2">certain veracity because it&#39;s was posed</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:58.280" style="s2">this vanishing area paradox the question</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.460" end="00:43:00.320" style="s2">is posed in the Scientific American you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.280" end="00:43:03.650" style="s2">do not believe that they are cheating</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.320" end="00:43:05.870" style="s2">you and they cheat you and what what</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.650" end="00:43:09.800" style="s2">what is happening is when when you look</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.870" end="00:43:11.570" style="s2">at it very very precisely the area where</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.800" end="00:43:14.510" style="s2">all of a sudden in the middle there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.570" end="00:43:17.720" style="s2">empty space has been artificially made</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.510" end="00:43:21.530" style="s2">slightly larger by giving slight slight</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.720" end="00:43:24.410" style="s2">more Angus in in the industry lines in</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.530" end="00:43:30.850" style="s2">summing up creates a little empty space</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.410" end="00:43:35.300" style="s2">yeah and I I solved it myself because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.850" end="00:43:38.870" style="s2">thought I cannot solve it because it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.300" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">defies my sense of reality in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.870" end="00:43:46.440" style="s2">of reality of everyone around me</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:51.120" style="s2">something is wrong what could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.440" end="00:43:53.820" style="s2">what could be wrong and I started to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.120" end="00:43:56.490" style="s2">check in one of the questions I asked</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.820" end="00:43:59.630" style="s2">myself could it be that this is a hoax</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.490" end="00:44:03.300" style="s2">that this is a fraud and if it&#39;s a fraud</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.630" end="00:44:07.170" style="s2">how do they cheat you on how do they</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.300" end="00:44:10.080" style="s2">cheat you senses senses of observation</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.170" end="00:44:11.700" style="s2">in this case well that touches on</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.080" end="00:44:13.500" style="s2">something that fascinated me there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.700" end="00:44:16.710" style="s2">quote of yours where apparently you were</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.500" end="00:44:20.370" style="s2">facing a booing audience booing at you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.710" end="00:44:23.190" style="s2">and you had the sense to say to them you</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.370" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">were all wrong sure if they were all</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.190" end="00:44:29.370" style="s2">wrong they were all wrong yes what is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:32.820" style="s2">in you that has the courage to stand up</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.370" end="00:44:36.150" style="s2">to seemingly I don&#39;t know arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.820" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">levels of negativity to problems of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.150" end="00:44:40.620" style="s2">other people think are insoluble where</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:43.500" style="s2">they have to invoke ancient aliens</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.620" end="00:44:46.200" style="s2">there&#39;s something so disagreeable about</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.500" end="00:44:48.870" style="s2">your personality that you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.200" end="00:44:52.550" style="s2">shepherding an idea through that much</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.870" end="00:44:56.100" style="s2">negativity what-what-what trade is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.550" end="00:44:59.700" style="s2">well it was a specific case when I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.100" end="00:45:05.670" style="s2">filming the the fires in Kuwait in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.700" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">first in the first Gulf War when Saddam</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.670" end="00:45:11.310" style="s2">Hussein&#39;s retreating army set every</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:14.010" style="s2">single oil well on fire and I filmed it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.310" end="00:45:16.590" style="s2">in a way that it looks as if it was shot</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.010" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">on a like a science fiction film it</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.590" end="00:45:23.030" style="s2">cannot be our planet and yet we know it</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:30.930" style="s2">must have been filmed on our planet and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.030" end="00:45:35.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s highly aesthetic highly stylized</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.930" end="00:45:39.000" style="s2">and in the immediate outcry was</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.000" end="00:45:41.070" style="s2">aestheticizing of the horror but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.000" end="00:45:44.100" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really horror it was not horror</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.070" end="00:45:46.920" style="s2">for any human being nobody got burned of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.100" end="00:45:51.810" style="s2">course it was a crime against creation</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.920" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">itself obscuring the sky for a wide wide</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.810" end="00:45:57.770" style="s2">area and in something that should not</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:57.770" style="s2">happen not only a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.070" end="00:46:05.550" style="s2">crime against the human race it was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.320" end="00:46:07.770" style="s2">crime against creation and and and in</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.550" end="00:46:10.320" style="s2">this screamin and people actually spat</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.770" end="00:46:12.590" style="s2">at me when I walked through the central</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.320" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">island that somehow reinforced my</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.590" end="00:46:19.770" style="s2">resolve and I I stepped up and I said</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.610" style="s2">Dante in his Inferno has done exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.770" end="00:46:23.010" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.610" end="00:46:27.060" style="s2">Geronimo&#39;s Bosh has done exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.010" end="00:46:30.330" style="s2">same in his hellish visions and Koya in</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.060" end="00:46:33.570" style="s2">his disastrous Tillich era has done the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.330" end="00:46:36.450" style="s2">same thing and and and and then the end</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.570" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">I said and you are all wrong so do we</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.450" end="00:46:45.140" style="s2">have to burn the book the Divine Comedy</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">now do we have to of course we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.140" end="00:46:53.580" style="s2">well so indeed that is a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:56.010" style="s2">amount of certainty in me that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.580" end="00:46:56.670" style="s2">not really anything that I can say was</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.010" end="00:47:00.840" style="s2">paroled</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.670" end="00:47:04.110" style="s2">it was totally natural to say that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.840" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">I met to me it sort of strikes me is we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.110" end="00:47:09.720" style="s2">need people to inspire us by showing us</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:12.930" style="s2">that it&#39;s not only possible that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.720" end="00:47:15.630" style="s2">necessary to stand up to large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.930" end="00:47:17.010" style="s2">of people inside of a crowd now one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.630" end="00:47:19.650" style="s2">the things that we could have it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.010" end="00:47:22.560" style="s2">literally the entire crowd the entire</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.650" end="00:47:26.550" style="s2">pretty yeah well that&#39;s how I perceived</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.560" end="00:47:30.090" style="s2">it walking down the central aisle there</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.550" end="00:47:33.090" style="s2">probably was a an amount of well-wishers</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.090" end="00:47:35.850" style="s2">and there must have been also some</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.090" end="00:47:39.180" style="s2">applause but it it was overwhelming it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.850" end="00:47:43.140" style="s2">was so overwhelming that some some very</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.180" end="00:47:45.660" style="s2">credible reviewers like Amos Foley who</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.140" end="00:47:49.620" style="s2">wrote for the Village Voice describes</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.660" end="00:47:52.890" style="s2">the scene he described it so it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:47:52.890" end="00:47:57.240" style="s2">there&#39;s this very strange story with the</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.240" end="00:48:02.280" style="s2">saw Bonnie and Clyde he gave it a</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.030" end="00:48:04.920" style="s2">terrible review because the violence was</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.280" end="00:48:07.350" style="s2">so disturbing and it was set to up-tempo</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.920" end="00:48:09.840" style="s2">happy music and he said well this is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.350" end="00:48:10.730" style="s2">abomination and then strangely a week or</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.730" end="00:48:15.350" style="s2">I have to review this film again I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.770" end="00:48:17.810" style="s2">totally wrong the film is a masterpiece</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.350" end="00:48:20.119" style="s2">because it took a while to just</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.810" end="00:48:21.830" style="s2">understand that that wasn&#39;t an error but</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.119" end="00:48:24.230" style="s2">it was actually a brilliant artistic</p>

<p begin="01:08:00.749" end="01:08:06.749" style="s2">of the alleged failures of the creators</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:09.779" style="s2">I think there will be a renascence and</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.749" end="01:08:12.979" style="s2">we see it already for example classical</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.779" end="01:08:16.859" style="s2">music all of a sudden as I just read</p>

<p begin="01:08:16.859" end="01:08:23.099" style="s2">on the internet that&#39;s all steered</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.469" end="01:08:25.079" style="s2">towards mainstream pop all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.099" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">you can access it or for example in</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.079" end="01:08:32.339" style="s2">movies The Criterion Collection which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:35.940" style="s2">a very very fine collection of films had</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.339" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">disappeared and reappeared apparently as</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.940" end="01:08:42.359" style="s2">it&#39;s either independent streaming label</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:43.380" style="s2">or within Amazon I have to find out I</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.359" end="01:08:45.420" style="s2">don&#39;t know yet</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.380" end="01:08:50.429" style="s2">but all of a sudden these things are</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.420" end="01:08:54.210" style="s2">back and the 15 year old from Missoula</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.429" end="01:08:59.609" style="s2">Montana is not just back his is just</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.210" end="01:09:03.500" style="s2">emerging so now I have no doubt that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.609" end="01:09:07.170" style="s2">are gonna see films that are outside</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.500" end="01:09:10.650" style="s2">outside of the regular mainstream but</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.170" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">have depth and vision and in wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.650" end="01:09:16.589" style="s2">stories I will not disappear the sheller</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:19.109" style="s2">will disappear</p>

<p begin="01:09:19.109" end="01:09:27.000" style="s2">look at talk show so it it it pop shows</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.650" end="01:09:29.490" style="s2">of the 1960s it&#39;s it&#39;s just stunning how</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.000" end="01:09:34.350" style="s2">how shallow they are and they disappear</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.490" end="01:09:36.770" style="s2">very quickly yeah there are some other</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.350" end="01:09:36.770" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.720" end="01:09:58.680" style="s2">well when I&#39;m speaking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.920" end="01:10:01.890" style="s2">technological utopia set inevitably will</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.680" end="01:10:05.640" style="s2">come to an end what comes to mind is</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.890" end="01:10:08.430" style="s2">immediately space space colonization not</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.640" end="01:10:14.820" style="s2">only is it an obscenity it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.430" end="01:10:18.510" style="s2">undoable obscenity because it hints it</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.820" end="01:10:21.660" style="s2">asks the human race like locusts grazing</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.510" end="01:10:24.060" style="s2">our planet empty and then moving on we</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.660" end="01:10:26.640" style="s2">can move on to Mars for example but it</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.060" end="01:10:29.610" style="s2">it should be contained and it&#39;s doable</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.640" end="01:10:32.400" style="s2">for a few scientists a few astronauts</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.610" end="01:10:34.170" style="s2">who have a small tiny little habitat</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.400" end="01:10:36.660" style="s2">where they have enough drinking water</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.170" end="01:10:40.830" style="s2">enough shelter against radiation and</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.660" end="01:10:46.680" style="s2">enough air to breathe yes we can create</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.830" end="01:10:49.170" style="s2">that we will not put 1 million humans on</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.680" end="01:10:51.780" style="s2">planet Mars it&#39;s not going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.170" end="01:10:55.770" style="s2">it&#39;s techno technically not really</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.780" end="01:10:58.500" style="s2">doable and unwise and a part of Mars we</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.770" end="01:11:01.010" style="s2">cannot reach anything outside of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.500" end="01:11:03.840" style="s2">solar system because it&#39;s simply too far</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.010" end="01:11:06.030" style="s2">it would take you a hundred ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.840" end="01:11:08.430" style="s2">years to reach the next one which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.030" end="01:11:12.030" style="s2">only three and a half or four and a half</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.430" end="01:11:16.670" style="s2">light-years away we just won&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.030" end="01:11:20.850" style="s2">to do it it&#39;s period and in this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.670" end="01:11:25.110" style="s2">illusion this kind of utopia technical</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.850" end="01:11:28.650" style="s2">utopia will come to a fairly quick end</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.110" end="01:11:30.760" style="s2">in our century or other utopias had come</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.650" end="01:11:33.740" style="s2">to mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.760" end="01:11:36.770" style="s2">immortality&#39; of course we can stretch</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.740" end="01:11:38.420" style="s2">out longevity to a certain point but</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.770" end="01:11:41.300" style="s2">that&#39;s about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.420" end="01:11:45.050" style="s2">we are going to die that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.300" end="01:11:46.160" style="s2">entire creation everywhere and not only</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.050" end="01:11:49.180" style="s2">on our planet</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.160" end="01:11:52.910" style="s2">everywhere points to the same thing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.180" end="01:11:57.890" style="s2">there&#39;s an impermanence of what is</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.910" end="01:12:00.110" style="s2">around everywhere so that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.890" end="01:12:03.740" style="s2">of the things I have to think about</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.110" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">other utopias take technically utopias</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.740" end="01:12:12.380" style="s2">but you are much closer to approaching</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:15.140" style="s2">technically utopias in I am so you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.380" end="01:12:17.180" style="s2">to find out what what we should do and</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.140" end="01:12:20.570" style="s2">what we should not do and what is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.180" end="01:12:26.870" style="s2">utopia and what is within the within</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.570" end="01:12:30.220" style="s2">realities of human beings you have time</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.870" end="01:12:30.220" style="s2">for one or two last questions</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.320" end="01:12:43.820" style="s2">the camera changes a real situation</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.570" end="01:12:46.670" style="s2">you talk about the real world when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.820" end="01:12:49.260" style="s2">meet rejected camera into it how it</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.670" end="01:12:54.030" style="s2">affects the perception of people</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.260" end="01:12:57.369" style="s2">we&#39;re yeah it&#39;s an old philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.030" end="01:13:00.330" style="s2">question and a physical question of how</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.369" end="01:13:05.260" style="s2">deep do you insert your camera or your</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.330" end="01:13:07.719" style="s2">position is observer does it change the</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.260" end="01:13:10.949" style="s2">reality that&#39;s out there hopefully it</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.719" end="01:13:13.810" style="s2">does because I&#39;m a creator I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.949" end="01:13:16.239" style="s2">observation camera in the bank that</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.810" end="01:13:19.270" style="s2">waits for 15 years in no bank robber</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.239" end="01:13:20.679" style="s2">ever shows up so we are not we are not</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.270" end="01:13:23.980" style="s2">the fly-on-the-wall</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.679" end="01:13:25.449" style="s2">I want to insert myself I want to create</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.980" end="01:13:29.349" style="s2">I want to mold</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.449" end="01:13:36.040" style="s2">I want to influence my story even the</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.349" end="01:13:39.219" style="s2">documentaries and I I do change facts</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.040" end="01:13:44.170" style="s2">and I&#39;m quoting now entre sheet the</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.219" end="01:13:47.320" style="s2">French writer who said I change facts to</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.170" end="01:13:51.280" style="s2">such a degree that they resemble truth</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.320" end="01:13:56.380" style="s2">more than reality and it&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.280" end="01:13:59.889" style="s2">way to say it and you see you are too if</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.380" end="01:14:03.610" style="s2">you are seriously asking the question</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.889" end="01:14:06.130" style="s2">with an indignant undertone it means</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.610" end="01:14:09.010" style="s2">that you are very much fact oriented</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.130" end="01:14:11.320" style="s2">which I don&#39;t believe in your case but</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.010" end="01:14:15.400" style="s2">many people are too fact oriented and</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.320" end="01:14:18.340" style="s2">cinema and does not have to be even</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.400" end="01:14:21.960" style="s2">documentaries have to only partly be</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.340" end="01:14:25.420" style="s2">effect oriented because effects do not</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.960" end="01:14:28.389" style="s2">equal truth they do not and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.420" end="01:14:30.880" style="s2">same thing like with family romance a</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.389" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">imposter gives you a deeper truth than</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:39.310" style="s2">the real person and my simplest of all</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:42.340" style="s2">explanations is and I have used it many</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.310" end="01:14:47.619" style="s2">times so if you have heard it from me my</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.340" end="01:14:52.690" style="s2">apologies Michelangelo creating the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.619" end="01:14:57.369" style="s2">sculptor of the pietá Jesus in the arms</p>

<p begin="01:15:03.060" end="01:15:09.429" style="s2">so of course it&#39;s not factually correct</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.480" end="01:15:13.690" style="s2">but he didn&#39;t want to cheat us or lie to</p>
