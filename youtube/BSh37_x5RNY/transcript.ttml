<p begin="00:00:02.889" end="00:00:10.680" style="s2">Today we will finish Freud.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.680" end="00:00:21.560" style="s2"> Freud has a peculiar position in the history of psychology, because Freud</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.560" end="00:00:24.249" style="s2"> was not a psychologist, but a doctor.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.249" end="00:00:30.869" style="s2"> Many of the clinicians whose theories we discuss were doctors,</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.869" end="00:00:31.869" style="s2"> no psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.869" end="00:00:37.120" style="s2"> In Freud&#39;s time, during his training, psychology was nonexistent</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.120" end="00:00:38.890" style="s2"> independent science.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.890" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2"> The same goes for Jung. As a result,</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:50.329" style="s2"> that as the new science of psychology evolved into what you are studying now, the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.329" end="00:00:53.239" style="s2"> and the medical world, were not involved.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.239" end="00:00:59.800" style="s2"> There has never been a meeting between the ideas of the experimental psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.800" end="00:01:00.969" style="s2"> and the psychoanalysts.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.969" end="00:01:09.189" style="s2"> Although in the 1980s cognitive psychologists proclaimed their discovery of the cognitive unconscious,</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.189" end="00:01:14.990" style="s2"> which made me somewhat ungrateful, since Freud, in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.990" end="00:01:20.390" style="s2"> had laid the foundations for the theory of the unconscious, and that quite extensively</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.390" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2"> almost a hundred years earlier.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:32.260" style="s2"> There is some resistance, as a psychoanalyst would say, among experimental psychologists,</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.260" end="00:01:36.140" style="s2"> to give Freud recognition for his discoveries. And I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.140" end="00:01:43.000" style="s2"> is very unhappy because 1) he made the discoveries, and 2) the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.010" end="00:01:48.220" style="s2"> still have more insight into the nature of the unconscious than modern experimental psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.220" end="00:01:54.280" style="s2"> Because modern experimental psychologists are convinced that the brain is a cognitive device,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.280" end="00:01:58.340" style="s2"> something like a computer, and they are not.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.340" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2"> It is a living system composed of other living subsystems.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:11.060" style="s2"> That means, as we have already discussed, that is the human psyche and its components</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.060" end="00:02:17.400" style="s2"> better regarded as personalities and sub-personalities, than in any other way,</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:22.670" style="s2"> such as systems or information processing mechanisms.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.670" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:32.120" style="s2"> I think it is the most fundamental achievement of psychoanalysis, in the footsteps of Nietzsche,</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.120" end="00:02:40.650" style="s2"> to think of the human mind, the psyche, as a collection of relatively integrated sub-personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.650" end="00:02:47.720" style="s2"> Even when modern people talk about themselves, they talk about the &quot;me,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.720" end="00:02:52.379" style="s2"> which is roughly the Freudian ego. They tend to see themselves as a unit.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.379" end="00:02:54.409" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:02:54.409" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2"> The problem with that idea is that people are constantly doing things ... they are doing things</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2"> they don&#39;t actually want to do, things they&#39;re ashamed of,</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:09.500" style="s2"> lie if they don&#39;t want to lie, or misbehave in general.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.500" end="00:03:14.110" style="s2"> And everyone knows you can try to be yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.110" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2"> to command something, but that doesn&#39;t really work.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:21.670" style="s2"> You have undoubtedly experienced this many times in your own life.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.670" end="00:03:25.070" style="s2"> If you&#39;re trying to study for something, you&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.070" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2"> interested in, all kinds of alternative options will appear</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:35.189" style="s2"> in the theater of your imagination.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.189" end="00:03:44.290" style="s2"> What happens in such situations is that parts of you are organized</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.290" end="00:03:52.349" style="s2"> for other purposes, or from the Freudian perspective, being driven by other desires,</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.349" end="00:03:55.409" style="s2"> trying to hijack your motor systems.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.409" end="00:04:04.160" style="s2"> That happens regularly, you postpone things</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.160" end="00:04:09.090" style="s2"> whether you rationalize or shift, those are all Freudian concepts.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.090" end="00:04:13.140" style="s2"> Shift is, for example, that instead of doing what you have to do,</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.140" end="00:04:14.140" style="s2"> is going to do something else.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.140" end="00:04:20.180" style="s2"> That&#39;s not a bad way to procrastinate, but it&#39;s also not great because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.180" end="00:04:22.100" style="s2"> don&#39;t focus on what to focus on.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.100" end="00:04:25.990" style="s2"> In a way, you are at war with myself.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.990" end="00:04:30.980" style="s2"> And the main player in the war, at least in principle, is the ego.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.980" end="00:04:35.500" style="s2"> That is the conscious mind, at least in the early stages of its theory formation.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.500" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2"> It&#39;s complicated to talk about Freud because his theory evolved</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:44.220" style="s2"> in the course of time. In the beginning, he divided the mind into the conscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:46.040" style="s2"> and the unconscious mind.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.040" end="00:04:50.530" style="s2"> You can see the conscious mind as yourself, the self</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.530" end="00:04:54.090" style="s2"> that you can refer to in your everyday experience.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.090" end="00:05:01.340" style="s2"> And the unconscious mind is a storehouse for two kinds of phenomena.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.340" end="00:05:10.200" style="s2"> Drives, which are anchored in instincts, and can conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.200" end="00:05:17.890" style="s2"> your current goal. Or memories, often traumatic, that you have not been able to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.890" end="00:05:21.500" style="s2"> in your consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.500" end="00:05:27.320" style="s2"> Those nasty things take on a life of their own.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.320" end="00:05:33.470" style="s2"> If you take an animal, and you take away bigger and bigger parts of its cortex,</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.470" end="00:05:37.780" style="s2"> that animal still continues to function like that animal.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.780" end="00:05:41.820" style="s2"> It starts to lose function, especially if you go deep into the brain, and it can</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.820" end="00:05:46.181" style="s2"> die if you go deep, but if you stay on the surface of the cortex</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.181" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2"> you can remove a lot of brain tissue without its ability to function</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.270" end="00:05:53.000" style="s2"> strongly disrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.000" end="00:05:58.610" style="s2"> That shows that the brain is organized in such a way that it has isolated parts</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.610" end="00:06:02.100" style="s2"> can act as a full personality.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.100" end="00:06:09.390" style="s2"> That demonstrates, in a sense, that the parts of the psyche,</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.390" end="00:06:14.500" style="s2"> or the subsystems of the brain can organize themselves as functional living units.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.500" end="00:06:16.300" style="s2"> That is also understandable.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.300" end="00:06:18.860" style="s2"> If you lose an arm, you don&#39;t stop functioning.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.860" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2"> You reorganize your personality without the arm.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:28.850" style="s2"> If you&#39;ve only been able to understand some subsystems of the potential manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.850" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2"> of your psyche, that collection will define the central personality.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.011" style="s2"> But all things you ignore or cannot integrate will have their own</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.011" end="00:06:39.040" style="s2"> live life.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.040" end="00:06:41.730" style="s2"> They don&#39;t just disappear.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.730" end="00:06:49.270" style="s2"> So Freud has the disturbing idea that you are not in charge of your own house.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.270" end="00:06:53.060" style="s2"> You can notice that by seeing how you do things</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.060" end="00:06:55.950" style="s2"> you don&#39;t want to do.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.950" end="00:06:59.610" style="s2"> For example things you don&#39;t want to be confronted with,</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.610" end="00:07:03.880" style="s2"> &#39;Cause many of the things you don&#39;t want to do are things you&#39;re ashamed of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.880" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2"> or that make you tense.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:10.370" style="s2"> And then there is the defeat you undergo, if your ego is hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.370" end="00:07:15.770" style="s2"> control the situation, but you discover that your behavior or thoughts are focused on something,</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.770" end="00:07:21.450" style="s2"> determined by something you thought you had under control.</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.450" end="00:07:24.130" style="s2"> You can see this clearly in conditions such as anorexia.</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.130" end="00:07:28.650" style="s2"> Especially when accompanied by bulimia, which is often the case.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.650" end="00:07:34.270" style="s2"> Anorexia is an eating disorder that causes people to take an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.270" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2"> experience disgust for their own body.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:40.900" style="s2"> And that disturbs their perception very much.</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.900" end="00:07:50.520" style="s2"> I had a client with anorexia at one point, a pretty short woman, maybe six feet.</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.520" end="00:07:51.780" style="s2"> Something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.780" end="00:07:54.860" style="s2"> Pretty thin, of course, she had anorexia.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.860" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2"> When she was in my office, I asked if her thigh was wider or narrower than mine.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:03.110" style="s2"> She said they were similar.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.110" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2"> So I took a piece of paper, sat on it, and marked the size of my thigh.</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:14.050" style="s2"> And then I let her sit on the same piece of paper, and she drew the size of her thigh.</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.050" end="00:08:18.220" style="s2"> And of course there was about that much space in between on both sides.</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.220" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2"> She watched it for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:26.140" style="s2"> She couldn&#39;t believe that it was.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.140" end="00:08:31.350" style="s2"> I think anorexic patients can no longer see their whole body.</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.350" end="00:08:32.350" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:32.350" end="00:08:38.140" style="s2"> If you look at yourself in the mirror, you have to form a &quot;Gestalt&quot;, as it were,</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.140" end="00:08:40.970" style="s2"> form an overall picture.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.970" end="00:08:45.280" style="s2"> You can also focus on small parts, but the more you concentrate on parts,</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.280" end="00:08:49.140" style="s2"> the more difficult it is to see the parts in relation to the whole.</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.140" end="00:08:54.930" style="s2"> And anorexic patients fixate on small parts and confuse themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.930" end="00:09:01.910" style="s2"> For example, if they look at their arm and it has flesh on it,</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.910" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2"> they cannot distinguish between meat and fat. And they don&#39;t want fat, they want</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2"> just blunt.</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:12.810" style="s2"> Because they are concerned about this small part, or</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.810" end="00:09:17.560" style="s2"> this little part, or whatever they focus on, they lose the ability</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.560" end="00:09:18.960" style="s2"> to perceive their body.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.960" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2"> And it&#39;s amazing how far that can go.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:29.690" style="s2"> And with bulimia, someone starves themselves for a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.690" end="00:09:35.870" style="s2"> We will look at this from modern physiology.</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.870" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2"> Eating behavior is regulated by the hypothalamus, which is a very old part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:43.000" style="s2"> that drives fundamental motivation systems.</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.000" end="00:09:47.140" style="s2"> It&#39;s just above the spinal cord, and it&#39;s a very strong control center</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.140" end="00:09:49.130" style="s2"> in the brain.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.130" end="00:09:52.850" style="s2"> It functions enough to ... I think I&#39;ve mentioned this before, that if you have a cat,</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.850" end="00:09:57.080" style="s2"> and you remove her entire cortex, and even most of the emotional systems,</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.080" end="00:10:01.930" style="s2"> if you leave the hypothalamus and spinal cord in place, which means she has almost no brain,</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.930" end="00:10:06.450" style="s2"> then she can behave normally as long as you keep her in a simple environment.</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:14.710" style="s2"> So the anorexic is trying to starve himself, that&#39;s a conscious goal,</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.710" end="00:10:20.200" style="s2"> or a goal connected to her ego, you may even see it as a goal that is motivated</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.200" end="00:10:26.550" style="s2"> by unconscious forces, because she may not know why she wants to starve herself.</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.550" end="00:10:33.620" style="s2"> But what usually happens is that she comes across a situation that upsets her ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.620" end="00:10:39.460" style="s2"> Being emotionally upset makes you tense or hurts you.</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.460" end="00:10:43.550" style="s2"> That activates brain areas that are higher than the hypothalamus, but nevertheless quite low,</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.550" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2"> they are quite primitive.</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:50.280" style="s2"> And what does such emotional upset let&#39;s call it stress,</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.280" end="00:10:52.450" style="s2"> is turning off long-term planning.</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.450" end="00:10:58.590" style="s2"> Because when you&#39;re stressed in the present moment, your body and brain assume</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.590" end="00:11:04.120" style="s2"> that you must use the energy for the hypothetical future</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.120" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2"> to solve the current problem. And that is often a more behavioral one</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2"> solution, such as stiffening, retracting, or the like.</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2"> So it shuts down your prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:20.590" style="s2"> When that happens, the hypothalamus, a very strong system,</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.590" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2"> in action, and dominates the person.</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:29.180" style="s2"> It&#39;s been around for tens of millions of years,</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.180" end="00:11:32.630" style="s2"> and his job is to keep you from starving.</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.630" end="00:11:36.630" style="s2"> And you can imagine someone in the course of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.630" end="00:11:41.030" style="s2"> who had a relatively weak urge to eat died.</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.030" end="00:11:43.810" style="s2"> Those were not our ancestors.</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.810" end="00:11:48.970" style="s2"> What happens to a bulimic patient is she gets upset by something, and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.970" end="00:11:53.840" style="s2"> gets an uncontrollable craving for something very high in calories, sweet and fat,</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.840" end="00:11:57.620" style="s2"> makes sense, given that she&#39;s starving. And then she eats a bowl of ice cream</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.620" end="00:11:59.630" style="s2"> and two loaves of bread.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.630" end="00:12:02.840" style="s2"> And they describe the state they are in when they do so</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.840" end="00:12:04.330" style="s2"> as dissociated.</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.330" end="00:12:06.790" style="s2"> It feels like they are not themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.790" end="00:12:08.970" style="s2"> You can imagine why.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.970" end="00:12:12.840" style="s2"> It is the whole domain of eating behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.840" end="00:12:18.170" style="s2"> And food is a sub-personality, it&#39;s not just behavior or a drive.</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.170" end="00:12:24.750" style="s2"> When you think about hunger, it&#39;s not like your brain is literally you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:26.550" style="s2"> send determined.</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.550" end="00:12:30.470" style="s2"> You start to fantasize about food, you start to think about what you like,</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.470" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2"> and then you start making plans where to go or what to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:39.060" style="s2"> the social environment, and all kinds of things.</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.060" end="00:12:42.540" style="s2"> And that&#39;s the hungry &quot;you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.540" end="00:12:48.960" style="s2"> In an anorexia or bulimics patient, the hungry part of the person is so dissociated</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.960" end="00:12:52.340" style="s2"> of the ego, that it is in fact a war.</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.340" end="00:12:56.840" style="s2"> But one of the problems with fighting your hypothalamus is that the hypothalamus almost always wins.</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.840" end="00:12:57.840" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:12:57.840" end="00:12:59.960" style="s2"> And that&#39;s a good thing, because otherwise you would die.</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.960" end="00:13:03.590" style="s2"> And many anorexic patients manage to starve themselves to death.</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.590" end="00:13:08.670" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good example of how strongly the mind can dissociate.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.670" end="00:13:13.980" style="s2"> The brain can dissociate in very strange ways.</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.980" end="00:13:15.820" style="s2"> An example.</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.820" end="00:13:20.820" style="s2"> I don&#39;t remember the name of this syndrome, maybe it still comes to mind.</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.820" end="00:13:26.860" style="s2"> You can have a particular stroke, and these are the effects of it.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.860" end="00:13:37.020" style="s2"> You develop the delusion that someone close to you ... Capgras syndrome ... has died</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.020" end="00:13:45.420" style="s2"> or kidnapped, or somehow disappeared, and replaced by an identical doppelganger.</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.420" end="00:13:51.480" style="s2"> It manifests as something related to psychosis.</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.480" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2"> What happens is that the stroke damages the relationship between the visual systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:04.660" style="s2"> identifying faces and the emotional systems that the recognized face connects to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:05.930" style="s2"> a familiar emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.930" end="00:14:09.730" style="s2"> Let&#39;s say it happens to you with your mama</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.730" end="00:14:12.470" style="s2"> you look at your mother, but it is not your mother.</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.470" end="00:14:17.811" style="s2"> &#39;Cause your mother comes with a collection of memories</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.811" end="00:14:21.180" style="s2"> it has a very large context of memories and feelings.</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.180" end="00:14:25.620" style="s2"> You look at that person, and she looks like your mother, but none of that happens.</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.620" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2"> Then you develop that idea: “If it&#39;s not my mom, but she looks</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:31.870" style="s2"> exactly the same thing, what is going on? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.870" end="00:14:38.350" style="s2"> And the answer is, &quot;She&#39;s been taken and replaced by a double.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.350" end="00:14:41.700" style="s2"> People get into serious trouble because of this delusion, because</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.700" end="00:14:46.550" style="s2"> they become obsessed with solving the problem, &quot;What have you done with my mom?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.550" end="00:14:54.779" style="s2"> You can understand why. But it is even stranger, because it depends on the medium.</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.779" end="00:14:59.520" style="s2"> If they hear their mother on the phone, it must be their mother.</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.520" end="00:15:03.370" style="s2"> You see how susceptible the brain is to dissociation.</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.370" end="00:15:07.220" style="s2"> Even at the level of small functions.</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.220" end="00:15:10.610" style="s2"> There are people who have had a stroke who can sing, but cannot speak.</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.610" end="00:15:14.290" style="s2"> There are those who lose nouns, and there are those who only lose verbs.</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.290" end="00:15:17.670" style="s2"> And there are people who recognize things, but cannot name them.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.670" end="00:15:24.520" style="s2"> So the idea that the brain can dissociate is clearly correct.</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.520" end="00:15:26.460" style="s2"> This is another example.</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.460" end="00:15:29.470" style="s2"> You are constantly dissociating.</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.470" end="00:15:33.430" style="s2"> If you look at how the brain is structured ...</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.430" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2"> Here runs a strip called the motor cortex.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:41.490" style="s2"> And if you operate on someone and touch that strip with an electrode,</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.490" end="00:15:44.649" style="s2"> he moves the corresponding body part.</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.649" end="00:15:50.490" style="s2"> And the hands are overrepresented, and also the face and the lips and the tongue,</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.490" end="00:15:51.990" style="s2"> for obvious reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.990" end="00:15:55.580" style="s2"> We root around the world quite a bit, we move our arms and hands a lot.</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.580" end="00:15:57.480" style="s2"> The feet are also over-represented.</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.480" end="00:16:01.300" style="s2"> And we talk about that with our face and our tongue.</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.300" end="00:16:05.990" style="s2"> There is a very large representation of that.</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.990" end="00:16:12.310" style="s2"> When you touch it, a movement arises, or at least the person feels a strong urge</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.310" end="00:16:13.540" style="s2"> to move.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.540" end="00:16:15.750" style="s2"> From this arose the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.750" end="00:16:21.470" style="s2"> People consider that the basis for abstract thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.470" end="00:16:27.570" style="s2"> That is not a good way to conceptualize it because you are not focused on thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.570" end="00:16:29.800" style="s2"> You are focused on acting.</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.800" end="00:16:34.680" style="s2"> The reason you think is to try actions in a small fantasy world,</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.680" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2"> before implementing them in your behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:44.060" style="s2"> Thinking through something means making an abstract world appear, and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.060" end="00:16:50.050" style="s2"> to let a representation of yourself act in that world, to estimate its consequences,</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.050" end="00:16:52.060" style="s2"> and decide whether to implement it.</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.060" end="00:16:55.000" style="s2"> That&#39;s another form of dissociation.</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.000" end="00:16:57.149" style="s2"> Because you can think without acting.</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.149" end="00:17:01.790" style="s2"> That part of yourself with which you make alternative worlds appear,</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.790" end="00:17:05.980" style="s2"> is what people strongly identify with.</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.980" end="00:17:10.430" style="s2"> The thinking part ... modern people see that thinking part</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.430" end="00:17:14.510" style="s2"> as itself, or the part that makes abstract ideas possible.</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.510" end="00:17:17.160" style="s2"> If that couldn&#39;t be dissociated, you would do whatever you think.</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.160" end="00:17:18.790" style="s2"> That wouldn&#39;t work well.</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.790" end="00:17:24.910" style="s2"> So the brain is basically designed to dissociate.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.910" end="00:17:33.370" style="s2"> If you understand that, and you understand the two kinds of phenomena that often</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.370" end="00:17:38.370" style="s2"> being dissociated, then you have the essence of Freudian theory.</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.370" end="00:17:44.679" style="s2"> Things that are often dissociated are 1) traumatic memories, I&#39;ll talk about that in a minute,</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.679" end="00:17:50.590" style="s2"> and 2) impulses ... they are not impulses, not even urges,</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.590" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2"> what was the Freudian way of thinking ... they are sub-personalities,</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.870" end="00:17:56.770" style="s2"> problematic sub-personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.770" end="00:18:01.710" style="s2"> And you can imagine that they are connected with complex positive and negative feelings.</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.710" end="00:18:10.760" style="s2"> Such as rancor, guilt, shame, anger, tension, jealousy, rage, lust,</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.760" end="00:18:17.260" style="s2"> all those emotions are difficult to integrate well into a personality.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.260" end="00:18:24.300" style="s2"> For in their pure manifestation they are not ... they disturb the social order.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.300" end="00:18:28.850" style="s2"> Think about how well regulated you are all here.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.850" end="00:18:35.080" style="s2"> It has been six million years since we separated from chimpanzees.</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.080" end="00:18:39.970" style="s2"> If we had some chimpanzees who would know each other as well as you know each other,</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.970" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2"> this place would be a bloodbath.</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:51.410" style="s2"> Somehow you can control your old instincts.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.410" end="00:18:55.730" style="s2"> That&#39;s how you can see it, and that&#39;s how Freud saw it. You learn to control them.</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.730" end="00:19:00.390" style="s2"> Freud&#39;s theory, and in this respect his differs from the theories we saw earlier,</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.390" end="00:19:05.550" style="s2"> for example at Piaget, Freud&#39;s theory is more about control.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.550" end="00:19:13.670" style="s2"> He thought all those subsystems and memories were in conflict with each other.</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.670" end="00:19:14.670" style="s2"> Like a war.</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.670" end="00:19:15.670" style="s2"> Like a Hobbesian war.</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.670" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2"> Hobbes was the philosopher who said life was nasty, brutal, and short,</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:24.540" style="s2"> and that in the natural state everyone is at war with each other.</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.540" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2"> And that&#39;s why you need a &quot;Leviathan,&quot; a control system from above that punishes all deviations from the social contract.</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.960" end="00:19:34.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:37.429" style="s2"> That is the Freudian superego.</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.429" end="00:19:41.390" style="s2"> Freud first thought in terms of unconscious and conscious mind,</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.390" end="00:19:45.500" style="s2"> but later he divided it into id, ego and superego.</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.500" end="00:19:50.040" style="s2"> And each of those parts had unconscious elements.</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.040" end="00:19:57.559" style="s2"> If you are in the throes of a sub-personality from the id, you would, you there</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.559" end="00:20:02.420" style="s2"> be aware of it, but it is possible that all sorts of other sub-personalities emerge from the id.</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.420" end="00:20:05.110" style="s2"> They are in your unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.110" end="00:20:09.799" style="s2"> It is also possible, and very likely, that the way you do</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.799" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2"> perceive the world, and the way you act, and even the goals you set,</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:19.740" style="s2"> being affected in ways you don&#39;t understand, by these unconscious systems.</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.740" end="00:20:24.670" style="s2"> For example, some of you want to be doctors, and if I ask you why,</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.670" end="00:20:30.150" style="s2"> you give me six humanitarian reasons, but the real reason is that your grandmother</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.150" end="00:20:32.679" style="s2"> would be disappointed if you did something else.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.679" end="00:20:36.520" style="s2"> And she may not even be alive anymore. Your mother may have</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.520" end="00:20:42.420" style="s2"> imitated your grandmother, making that ideal strongly embodied by her,</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.420" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2"> and thus unspoken expectations about your behavior have arisen since childhood.</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:52.530" style="s2"> That&#39;s an interesting part of psychodynamics,</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.530" end="00:20:54.800" style="s2"> for that you have to be on your guard in your personal relationships.</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.800" end="00:21:00.530" style="s2"> It often happens, when you observe someone closely, that someone ...</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.530" end="00:21:05.549" style="s2"> a loved one, because you have to know him well, that someone is taken over</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.549" end="00:21:08.490" style="s2"> through the spirit of being one of his ancestors.</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.490" end="00:21:11.400" style="s2"> I don&#39;t mean that in a metaphysical way.</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.400" end="00:21:19.531" style="s2"> I mean that the thoughts ... the personality of the grandmother, or the personality of the mother,</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.531" end="00:21:25.990" style="s2"> has a structure that the person in question knows well, and he has</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.990" end="00:21:29.900" style="s2"> spent a lot of time imitating them in different ways.</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.900" end="00:21:33.860" style="s2"> And those imitated structures can be passed on from generation to generation.</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.860" end="00:21:38.030" style="s2"> That is what partially constitutes your culture.</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.030" end="00:21:43.530" style="s2"> The imitated personality of all your ancestors constitutes your culture.</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.530" end="00:21:45.250" style="s2"> And that can take hold of you.</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.250" end="00:21:50.510" style="s2"> Ideologies can take hold of you ... not in exactly the same way, but in a similar way.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.510" end="00:21:56.690" style="s2"> There is the id, the ego and the superego.</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.690" end="00:22:00.760" style="s2"> And as in the Hobbesian world, there is a lot of tension between those parts,</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.760" end="00:22:06.890" style="s2"> thus id always tries to get its basic needs satisfied.</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.890" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2"> In Freud&#39;s time, this was especially problematic when it came to sex.</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:16.710" style="s2"> The reasons for that are pretty clear.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.710" end="00:22:24.940" style="s2"> They were not reliable contraceptives, there was very little work for women,</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.940" end="00:22:29.060" style="s2"> so their sexual behavior had to be very strictly regulated, or else</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.060" end="00:22:34.130" style="s2"> they would end up outside the social fabric, into prostitution or something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.130" end="00:22:39.170" style="s2"> And there was the great threat of several STDs, in particular syphilis,</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.170" end="00:22:40.820" style="s2"> a terrible disease.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.820" end="00:22:47.080" style="s2"> It can mimic all kinds of diseases and can be passed from mother to child.</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.080" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:50.059" style="s2"> A nasty disease.</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.059" end="00:22:56.890" style="s2"> So it was very difficult for the Victorians to integrate sexuality.</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.890" end="00:22:58.770" style="s2"> Because how did you do that?</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.770" end="00:23:04.750" style="s2"> The road to potential integration, which the superego would approve,</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.750" end="00:23:06.120" style="s2"> was marriage.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.120" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2"> Back in the 1960s, people used to get married around</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:14.910" style="s2"> nineteen or twenty years, but that is historically unique.</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.910" end="00:23:19.429" style="s2"> In the Victorian era, a man could not afford to get married,</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.429" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2"> until he was at least in his mid-twenties. He didn&#39;t have the resources for that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:26.020" style="s2"> Women usually married younger.</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.020" end="00:23:31.710" style="s2"> So there was a long time for men, but also for women,</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.710" end="00:23:40.260" style="s2"> that the sexual drive (from a Freudian perspective) was fully manifested,</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.260" end="00:23:44.419" style="s2"> without any socially approved mode of expression.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.419" end="00:23:49.070" style="s2"> Under such circumstances there is a war between the id and the superego,</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.070" end="00:23:51.629" style="s2"> and the poor ego is crushed in between.</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.629" end="00:23:56.010" style="s2"> That was evident in the movie we watched, &quot;Crumb,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.010" end="00:23:58.360" style="s2"> for they were actually in the same situation.</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.360" end="00:24:03.570" style="s2"> There was no socially approved way for them to manifest sexual or aggressive behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.570" end="00:24:04.570" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:04.570" end="00:24:10.110" style="s2"> And thus, they become fundamental sub-personalities</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.110" end="00:24:14.530" style="s2"> highly pathological.</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.530" end="00:24:18.570" style="s2"> Particularly characterized by bitterness and the desire for revenge.</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.570" end="00:24:24.610" style="s2"> These systems think. If someone is very sexually frustrated,</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.610" end="00:24:29.470" style="s2"> and let&#39;s think of the wider context,</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.470" end="00:24:35.170" style="s2"> because sexuality is not real ... it is not a one-dimensional drive.</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.170" end="00:24:38.970" style="s2"> It has to do with playfulness, with the desire for social contact,</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.970" end="00:24:43.630" style="s2"> the desire for communication, the desire for touch.</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.630" end="00:24:46.200" style="s2"> It is a complex phenomenon with several ramifications.</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.200" end="00:24:52.460" style="s2"> The people we saw in the movie had none of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.460" end="00:24:57.020" style="s2"> integrated in their personality, or allowed by society.</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.020" end="00:25:04.460" style="s2"> It got twisted, distorted, and frustrated, and sparked all kinds of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.460" end="00:25:07.040" style="s2"> rancor and revenge.</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.040" end="00:25:13.110" style="s2"> So you can develop a very sick subpersonality.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.110" end="00:25:18.300" style="s2"> In that one cartoon that was the most disturbing,</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.300" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2"> where Mr. Natural Robert brought that headless woman ...</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:26.570" style="s2"> He wanted pure satisfaction without responsibility.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.570" end="00:25:30.040" style="s2"> That is really a phenomenon that is driven by the id.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.040" end="00:25:34.820" style="s2"> He slept with her, and immediately afterward felt very guilty.</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.820" end="00:25:37.950" style="s2"> Think about what that means.</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.950" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2"> It is as if someone is in the grip of one sub-personality, which already are</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:44.982" style="s2"> thoughts and memories and feelings.</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.982" end="00:25:49.500" style="s2"> And suddenly it is satisfied. So he is satisfied, disappears and &quot;bam:&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.500" end="00:25:51.090" style="s2"> the other appears.</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.090" end="00:25:57.370" style="s2"> In this case it was guilt, shame, fear, horror, and self-hatred.</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.370" end="00:25:58.669" style="s2"> All those things.</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.669" end="00:26:03.730" style="s2"> If you read about the experiences of people who commit very heinous crimes,</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.730" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2"> it is very common for them to have exactly this experience.</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2"> They are driven by sexual / aggressive impulses, because that&#39;s usually the impulses that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:18.530" style="s2"> end in particularly terrible crimes.</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.530" end="00:26:22.410" style="s2"> They do that, and then they switch to their normal personality,</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.410" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2"> and are completely shocked by what they have done.</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.570" end="00:26:29.850" style="s2"> More than one person inhabits the same psyche.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.850" end="00:26:36.120" style="s2"> They are linked by memory, although Freud would say you,</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.120" end="00:26:37.860" style="s2"> your memory can also dissociate.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.860" end="00:26:42.460" style="s2"> That&#39;s why Freud talked about repressed memories.</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.460" end="00:26:51.630" style="s2"> That has caused a lot of problems, for various reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.630" end="00:27:03.710" style="s2"> Because your memory is not an objective recording ... it is not an objective, non-biased recording</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.710" end="00:27:06.820" style="s2"> of actual events.</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.820" end="00:27:11.420" style="s2"> First, because you cannot objectively record certain events, as we discussed earlier.</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.420" end="00:27:12.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:12.420" end="00:27:17.460" style="s2"> You can have an argument between a man and a woman who have been married for twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.460" end="00:27:23.330" style="s2"> do not record objectively, when it comes to something important, because for them every word, every phrase,</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.330" end="00:27:28.580" style="s2"> every sentence and every facial expression, are interpreted within the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.580" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2"> entire relationship, to determine the meaning of what is said.</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:35.950" style="s2"> And you can&#39;t possibly record that with a camera.</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.950" end="00:27:39.380" style="s2"> Then you should have filmed the entire relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.380" end="00:27:41.260" style="s2"> And you don&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.260" end="00:27:45.539" style="s2"> Memory is a very peculiar thing, and the idea that you have one</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.539" end="00:27:49.539" style="s2"> objective recording is not very refined.</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.539" end="00:27:56.730" style="s2"> Either way, Freud&#39;s idea was, in a sense ...</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.730" end="00:28:02.610" style="s2"> I hate to say it ... an under-refined idea of ​​what memory was.</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.610" end="00:28:06.220" style="s2"> I don&#39;t like to say that because Freud was a very educated person.</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.220" end="00:28:11.700" style="s2"> But he believed in the existence of an objective interpersonal world.</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.700" end="00:28:16.429" style="s2"> He thought if something terrible happened to you as a child,</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.429" end="00:28:18.290" style="s2"> that you then had a recording of it in your memory.</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.290" end="00:28:21.990" style="s2"> It was there as a memory, as the event.</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.990" end="00:28:27.450" style="s2"> Then you needed some kind of censor that would displace that,</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.450" end="00:28:34.160" style="s2"> and a place where that would go, and that would be the unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.160" end="00:28:39.480" style="s2"> But if you&#39;re analyzing a traumatic memory with someone ... sorry ...</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.480" end="00:28:49.180" style="s2"> He also thought that a repressed memory could be represented in a symptom, a symbolic symptom.</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.180" end="00:28:50.180" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:28:50.180" end="00:28:58.400" style="s2"> I think repression theory suffers from the incorrectness of the way memory is represented.</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.400" end="00:29:00.860" style="s2"> This is another way to view it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.860" end="00:29:05.790" style="s2"> It is based on the layered model, the hierarchical layered model that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.790" end="00:29:07.450" style="s2"> explained in the course of the lectures.</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.450" end="00:29:14.820" style="s2"> Imagine you were abused by your uncle (because is usually a family member)</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.820" end="00:29:16.240" style="s2"> when you were four.</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.240" end="00:29:17.240" style="s2"> Sexually abused.</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.240" end="00:29:22.419" style="s2"> The first thing you have to ask yourself is what exactly you have for memory.</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.419" end="00:29:23.419" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:29:23.419" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2"> Imagine that you are completely sexually naive, you know nothing</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:33.310" style="s2"> about sex, its implications or mechanisms, but it happens to you.</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.310" end="00:29:37.330" style="s2"> The first question is: how do you represent that?</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.330" end="00:29:41.970" style="s2"> Because to remember something, you have to represent it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.970" end="00:29:44.809" style="s2"> Because you don&#39;t just have a memory of the event.</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.809" end="00:29:49.240" style="s2"> It&#39;s always an interpretation, because so many things happen at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.240" end="00:29:55.130" style="s2"> So maybe your representation is pain and confusion, something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.130" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2"> And then there is the next layer, namely the need for secrecy.</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:05.799" style="s2"> Because the one who abuses you will say to you ...</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.799" end="00:30:12.130" style="s2"> one of three things: &quot;It&#39;s good for you,&quot; &quot;You asked for it,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t tell anyone,</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.130" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2"> because they will think you are bad. This is our secret. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:16.520" style="s2"> Something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.520" end="00:30:22.800" style="s2"> So there is that layer of secrecy and inadmissibility, and what to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.800" end="00:30:24.890" style="s2"> when you are four?</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.890" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2"> How are you supposed to understand that something just happened, what to no one</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:30.539" style="s2"> may share?</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.539" end="00:30:34.860" style="s2"> You don&#39;t have a model of the world that is sophisticated enough to cover all of that.</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.860" end="00:30:41.110" style="s2"> What you might do then is avoid thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.110" end="00:30:43.530" style="s2"> That is not exactly the same as repression.</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.530" end="00:30:46.140" style="s2"> To avoid thinking about something is not to repress.</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.140" end="00:30:50.250" style="s2"> Because it doesn&#39;t require an active censor.</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.250" end="00:30:56.990" style="s2"> And years later, you begin, perhaps, to remember what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.990" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2"> But what you remember is unclear chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:07.130" style="s2"> You may think, &quot;How can things be represented as memories,</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.130" end="00:31:10.230" style="s2"> if you can&#39;t develop a detailed representation? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.230" end="00:31:14.730" style="s2"> What seems to be happening, and this is in a sense the reverse of Freudian theory,</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.730" end="00:31:20.840" style="s2"> is that the event is represented in the body.</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.840" end="00:31:29.680" style="s2"> So you can see the representation of events as a layered neurological phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.680" end="00:31:33.330" style="s2"> What happens when you encounter something unexpected or frightening</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.330" end="00:31:37.720" style="s2"> the very old reflexive systems respond first.</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.720" end="00:31:39.880" style="s2"> And they are fast.</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.880" end="00:31:43.770" style="s2"> They protect you against a snake bite, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.770" end="00:31:44.770" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:31:44.770" end="00:31:47.520" style="s2"> If a snake attacks you, you jump back, and you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.520" end="00:31:49.540" style="s2"> before you even see the snake.</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.540" end="00:31:54.659" style="s2"> Because you need about a quarter of a second to create a complex visual representation of the snake</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.659" end="00:31:55.659" style="s2"> to produce.</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.659" end="00:31:59.240" style="s2"> And if you wait a quarter of a second, you&#39;re dead.</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.240" end="00:32:04.950" style="s2"> Your nervous system has preserved basic reflexes, only those</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.950" end="00:32:06.760" style="s2"> some synapses are long.</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.760" end="00:32:10.820" style="s2"> They may work between your retina and your spinal cord.</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.820" end="00:32:15.800" style="s2"> Your retina and an old emotional system such as the amygdala are connected</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.800" end="00:32:21.580" style="s2"> seeing things like snakes, and it only sends a message to your spinal cord,</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.580" end="00:32:25.640" style="s2"> or slightly more complex motor systems, with the message: &quot;Now jump back!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.640" end="00:32:29.730" style="s2"> And only after that your heart rate accelerates,</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.730" end="00:32:33.920" style="s2"> and your blood pressure goes up, and you start to breathe heavily. And then you feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.920" end="00:32:39.210" style="s2"> a wave of fear and aversion, perhaps to teach you something so stupid</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.210" end="00:32:40.210" style="s2"> not to do again.</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.210" end="00:32:44.850" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know exactly why you would experience negative emotions,</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.850" end="00:32:51.080" style="s2"> or what function that negative emotion has, except that we know it is a behavioral pattern</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.080" end="00:32:58.450" style="s2"> followed by a punishment or threat has a smaller chance of being executed again.</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.450" end="00:32:59.450" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:32:59.450" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2"> So the reaction to the unknown is physical, then emotional,</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:10.500" style="s2"> then pictorial, in the imagination, &quot;What just happened?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.500" end="00:33:13.080" style="s2"> And then possibly expressed in language.</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.080" end="00:33:17.500" style="s2"> But a lot of things don&#39;t transfer from image to language, and some things</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.500" end="00:33:20.429" style="s2"> stay at the level of the body.</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.429" end="00:33:29.610" style="s2"> Sorry.</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.610" end="00:33:35.190" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think that traumatic memories have been repressed, as Freud thought,</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.190" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2"> if they are not developed.</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:42.350" style="s2"> Okay, I&#39;ll tell a story about how this could work.</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.350" end="00:33:46.190" style="s2"> At one point, I had a client who was twenty-seven, and I only saw her once.</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.190" end="00:33:49.260" style="s2"> I had just started my training as a psychotherapist.</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.260" end="00:33:54.980" style="s2"> She came to me and said she was haunted by the thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.980" end="00:33:58.660" style="s2"> that she had been sexually assaulted as a child.</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.660" end="00:34:01.390" style="s2"> I asked, &quot;Who did that to you?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.390" end="00:34:03.340" style="s2"> And she said, &quot;It was my brother.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.340" end="00:34:06.549" style="s2"> And she said, &quot;He was much older than me.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.549" end="00:34:11.300" style="s2"> So I made a mental picture of it where she was between ten and thirteen years old,</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.300" end="00:34:16.940" style="s2"> and her brother between fifteen and twenty. Because she said that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.940" end="00:34:22.389" style="s2"> she was overpowered by a physically bigger man.</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.389" end="00:34:24.089" style="s2"> We talked for a while.</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.089" end="00:34:25.569" style="s2"> And then she told me ...</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.569" end="00:34:27.369" style="s2"> I asked, &quot;How old were you when this happened?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.369" end="00:34:29.419" style="s2"> And she said, &quot;I was four.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.419" end="00:34:33.540" style="s2"> And then I asked, &quot;Okay, and how old was your brother?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.540" end="00:34:36.099" style="s2"> And she said, &quot;He was six.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.099" end="00:34:40.349" style="s2"> So I said, &quot;See, you can see it like this.</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.349" end="00:34:43.069" style="s2"> You look at it from the perspective of a four-year-old.</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.069" end="00:34:44.879" style="s2"> That is a form of regression.</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:49.489" style="s2"> That&#39;s how old you are when you experience the memory.</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.489" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2"> This is a different idea.</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:58.829" style="s2"> Your brother was not a predator, you were children who were looked after very badly. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.829" end="00:35:03.900" style="s2"> Then a light came on.</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.900" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2"> Because she had never thought about it that way.</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:10.950" style="s2"> She never had that representation ... her emotional experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.950" end="00:35:14.849" style="s2"> as a four year old versus a six year old, a six year old is much bigger and stronger</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.849" end="00:35:16.950" style="s2"> than a four year old ...</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.950" end="00:35:22.730" style="s2"> That is about fifty percent older, which is a big difference when you are four.</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.730" end="00:35:30.339" style="s2"> But when it comes to the relevance of the memory for current conceptualization and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.339" end="00:35:36.420" style="s2"> it was much better for her to &quot;update&quot; the reminder and think:</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.420" end="00:35:40.729" style="s2"> “A six-year-old is so big, and a four-year-old is so big.</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.729" end="00:35:42.049" style="s2"> Where were my parents? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.049" end="00:35:46.260" style="s2"> And that&#39;s a completely different story than the one she came in with.</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.260" end="00:35:51.719" style="s2"> That seemed to be a great relief to her. Because if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.719" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2"> suffer from a traumatic memory, it keeps returning,</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:00.849" style="s2"> that&#39;s one of the ways to identify a traumatic memory that it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.849" end="00:36:01.849" style="s2"> leave alone.</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.849" end="00:36:06.009" style="s2"> It appears in dreams and when your mind wanders</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.009" end="00:36:09.400" style="s2"> and maybe when you go to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.400" end="00:36:11.730" style="s2"> it enters your mind.</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.730" end="00:36:17.500" style="s2"> There is a reason, and the reason is the underlying emotional systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.500" end="00:36:24.030" style="s2"> dealing with stress, mainly the hippocampus and the amygdala,</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.030" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2"> causing that are an alarm system.</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2"> The alarm means something potentially dangerous has happened, you need to find out</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:36.749" style="s2"> what that means, so that you can prevent that from happening again in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.749" end="00:36:39.039" style="s2"> So you need a plan.</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.039" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2"> And to make a plan, you have to make a causal analysis of the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:46.009" style="s2"> your behavior and the traumatic event.</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.009" end="00:36:47.410" style="s2"> That&#39;s the first.</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.410" end="00:36:51.059" style="s2"> And then you have to come up with something that will stop that from happening.</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.059" end="00:36:56.119" style="s2"> And with my client that happened immediately, because now she was</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.119" end="00:37:00.790" style="s2"> a woman of twenty-seven, and the chance that she would end up in it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.790" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2"> a situation that would be the same as her memory was zero.</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:15.559" style="s2"> I&#39;ve seen this with other clients too. I had another client,</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.559" end="00:37:21.089" style="s2"> I think I have already told you a little bit about her when she was four years old</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.089" end="00:37:26.170" style="s2"> jumped in a shopping cart and drove down a cobbled hill,</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.170" end="00:37:28.900" style="s2"> and fell out at the bottom, and hurt himself.</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.900" end="00:37:30.119" style="s2"> They took her to the hospital.</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.119" end="00:37:33.609" style="s2"> And then she was on edge because of the threat.</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.609" end="00:37:37.039" style="s2"> That means you are open to reprogramming.</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.039" end="00:37:40.890" style="s2"> And in the hospital they did not allow visits from her parents,</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.890" end="00:37:42.190" style="s2"> a couple of weeks.</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.190" end="00:37:47.509" style="s2"> So the trauma, the pain, the tension, the threat, the ambulance ride,</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.509" end="00:37:52.579" style="s2"> and all those things put her in such a state, what maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.579" end="00:37:57.720" style="s2"> is a state in which you are particularly sensitive to learning. Because when something traumatic is going on</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.720" end="00:38:01.829" style="s2"> you should learn from that, what the world is like at that moment.</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.829" end="00:38:09.309" style="s2"> And she developed a permanent paranoia for institutions through that trauma</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.309" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2"> which, by the time I met her, had grown into a whole philosophy of institutional oppression.</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:21.160" style="s2"> Understandable, but the essence was that combination of physical trauma</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.160" end="00:38:23.319" style="s2"> and psychological trauma.</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.319" end="00:38:31.219" style="s2"> And the wrong act in that situation by people with authority.</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.219" end="00:38:35.450" style="s2"> You can see how under such circumstances a traumatic memory can become the core</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.450" end="00:38:40.580" style="s2"> of a great sub-personality, which must be taken apart very carefully.</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.580" end="00:38:45.650" style="s2"> Especially if that sub-personality cannot easily be integrated into the world.</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.650" end="00:38:50.239" style="s2"> For example, if you are suspicious of all institutions, you really have a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.239" end="00:38:54.479" style="s2"> Because in the modern world you are constantly forced to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.479" end="00:38:55.719" style="s2"> with institutions.</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.719" end="00:39:02.190" style="s2"> And if you&#39;re more suspicious and suspicious than you would if you were more educated</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.190" end="00:39:05.400" style="s2"> they will treat you badly incessantly.</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.400" end="00:39:10.289" style="s2"> &#39;Cause when a dog comes up to you and looks suspiciously and barks and growls,</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.289" end="00:39:13.210" style="s2"> won&#39;t you pet him.</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.210" end="00:39:19.670" style="s2"> The way you interact with the system ... the response of a system to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.670" end="00:39:23.869" style="s2"> largely depends on how you approach the system.</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.869" end="00:39:28.150" style="s2"> Either way, that idea of ​​dissociation is very strong.</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.150" end="00:39:33.799" style="s2"> If you want to get to know yourself better, and this is kind of a combination</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.799" end="00:39:38.759" style="s2"> of Freudian and Jungian ideas, then what you can do is ... Imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.759" end="00:39:40.540" style="s2"> you have a goal in mind.</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.540" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2"> The first question you can ask yourself is: why do you have that goal?</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:51.180" style="s2"> What influences determined that goal for you? Cause it could be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.180" end="00:39:57.430" style="s2"> either partially consciously, or poorly worded, or implicitly, all those things.</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.430" end="00:40:02.630" style="s2"> So you want to know why you do what you do.</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.630" end="00:40:08.470" style="s2"> And the second is, if you find yourself avoiding things towards the target,</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.470" end="00:40:12.239" style="s2"> then the next question is: why are you avoiding those things?</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.239" end="00:40:16.089" style="s2"> That means you have to descend into parts of yourself that are hidden</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.089" end="00:40:17.089" style="s2"> and quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.089" end="00:40:22.150" style="s2"> So, for example, if you discover that you are pursuing a certain goal because</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.150" end="00:40:28.900" style="s2"> your parents want that, the question immediately appears:</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.900" end="00:40:32.009" style="s2"> &quot;Yes, but is that what you want too?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.009" end="00:40:35.759" style="s2"> And that is a very complicated question.</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.759" end="00:40:39.759" style="s2"> Because you have to detach from the part of yourself that doesn&#39;t want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.759" end="00:40:43.920" style="s2"> the part that wants to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.920" end="00:40:46.989" style="s2"> And then you have to figure out why you are trying to avoid it.</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.989" end="00:40:53.009" style="s2"> You may be incredibly angry that you were pushed in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.009" end="00:40:57.749" style="s2"> for reasons unrelated to you. So that every time</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.749" end="00:41:03.950" style="s2"> that you have the opportunity to study or achieve something closer to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.950" end="00:41:08.760" style="s2"> you bring your goal, you are not motivated, you cannot pay attention,</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.760" end="00:41:15.030" style="s2"> you can&#39;t study, you put things off all the time, or do very counterproductive things.</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.030" end="00:41:16.030" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:41:16.030" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2"> People can ...</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:25.331" style="s2"> Someone wrote to me recently because he was watching the talks on YouTube.</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.331" end="00:41:30.940" style="s2"> He said he had been dreaming for six weeks that he drove his car into a chasm and destroyed it.</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.940" end="00:41:31.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:41:31.960" end="00:41:36.289" style="s2"> At the end of the series of dreams, he drove his car into an abyss, into destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.289" end="00:41:37.450" style="s2"> And he asked what that meant.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.450" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2"> I said, &quot;The dream tells you that you are way too careless with your life.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:42.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:41:42.920" end="00:41:47.559" style="s2"> That&#39;s what repeatedly driving a car into a cliff means.</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.559" end="00:41:52.150" style="s2"> That is a descent, an unconscious descent into the underworld.</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.150" end="00:42:00.950" style="s2"> He was warned. The psychological reality was such that the warning was very serious,</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.950" end="00:42:02.339" style="s2"> like the danger.</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.339" end="00:42:05.829" style="s2"> Then you ask the question, &quot;Why would he drive himself into the abyss?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.829" end="00:42:08.200" style="s2"> That&#39;s a suicide gesture.</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.200" end="00:42:12.200" style="s2"> Then you ask, &quot;Why would anyone be suicidal?&quot; Well for example</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.200" end="00:42:15.780" style="s2"> to take revenge on his parents, or revenge on the whole world,</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.780" end="00:42:19.410" style="s2"> or revenge on himself, or he wants to be his</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.410" end="00:42:25.450" style="s2"> painful consciousness, or he lives a chaotic and meaningless and harrowing life</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.450" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2"> and wants to punish himself for it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:32.190" style="s2"> It is very complicated and confused in depth.</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.190" end="00:42:36.059" style="s2"> And people don&#39;t like to look at that, and in a sense it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.059" end="00:42:37.999" style="s2"> &quot;shadow&quot; element.</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.999" end="00:42:41.269" style="s2"> Because what you find there is rarely what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.269" end="00:42:47.619" style="s2"> One of the most important guidelines of Jungian psychotherapy, and of most therapies,</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.619" end="00:42:51.339" style="s2"> is the idea that you should find out what you are avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.339" end="00:42:53.969" style="s2"> and then discover how to voluntarily confront.</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.969" end="00:42:58.709" style="s2"> You can add to that: you have to understand what you are doing and why,</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.709" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2"> and see if that&#39;s really what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:03.999" style="s2"> And whether you like those reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.999" end="00:43:08.069" style="s2"> That&#39;s a summary of therapy in a few sentences.</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.069" end="00:43:14.859" style="s2"> But in order to do that, you have to look at the things you have been avoiding.</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.859" end="00:43:16.260" style="s2"> What do you avoid?</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.260" end="00:43:18.670" style="s2"> No rainbows and cookies, right?</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.670" end="00:43:22.660" style="s2"> The things you avoid are the things no one wants to see.</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.660" end="00:43:30.459" style="s2"> Jung&#39;s main guideline for psychotherapy was a Latin phrase: &quot;In stercore invernitur,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.459" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2"> which I probably mispronounce. It means &quot;it is found in the dirt,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:40.869" style="s2"> or &quot;what you want most is found where you least want to search.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.869" end="00:43:44.959" style="s2"> And that&#39;s a terrible philosophy.</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.959" end="00:43:51.650" style="s2"> But you can see that it speaks for itself. Of course are the things you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.650" end="00:43:54.890" style="s2"> the things you don&#39;t want to be confronted with.</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.890" end="00:43:55.890" style="s2"> Of course.</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.890" end="00:44:00.950" style="s2"> The shadow of the psyche ... when we watched the movie for example,</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.950" end="00:44:06.299" style="s2"> you saw those urges, mainly sexual and aggressive, manifesting themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.299" end="00:44:07.859" style="s2"> in several ways.</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.859" end="00:44:12.410" style="s2"> Those would be the repressed or non-integrated parts of the id.</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.410" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2"> But that had another, more complex side, because they responded to that,</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:28.369" style="s2"> because they felt trampled and oppressed, and were anti-social and critical</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.369" end="00:44:30.700" style="s2"> to social structures, and all that.</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.700" end="00:44:35.209" style="s2"> Because they were unable to properly manifest in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.209" end="00:44:39.670" style="s2"> And that created fantasies of extreme destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.670" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2"> In their case, it mainly had to do with sex.</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:47.730" style="s2"> But in other people that can manifest itself in incredibly violent fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.730" end="00:44:50.739" style="s2"> about the destruction of society.</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.739" end="00:44:56.549" style="s2"> So if not all parts of yourself are allowed to participate in the game, the parts will be left behind</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.549" end="00:45:01.069" style="s2"> not be happy with that. And they will not happily hold a tea party.</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.069" end="00:45:06.469" style="s2"> They turn into twisted monsters, especially as you get older.</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.469" end="00:45:12.060" style="s2"> And their demeanor is anything but positive.</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.060" end="00:45:18.760" style="s2"> The Freudian world, the world of the psychoanalytic unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.760" end="00:45:23.079" style="s2"> is a terrifying place because it makes you doubt everything.</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.079" end="00:45:26.250" style="s2"> It&#39;s not paranoia.</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.250" end="00:45:34.989" style="s2"> Once you have been psychoanalytically trained, it is very difficult to accept</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.989" end="00:45:40.219" style="s2"> that one&#39;s charitable motivations are only what someone claims they are.</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.219" end="00:45:43.940" style="s2"> You are always looking for the other missing aspect.</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.940" end="00:45:48.309" style="s2"> I think that is very useful. Because you meet people, especially ideologues,</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.309" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2"> who claim to act for the good of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2"> Yes ... and you are a saint?</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:45:59.430" style="s2"> Why should I believe that the good is only on your side?</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.430" end="00:46:01.569" style="s2"> What are you holding back?</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.569" end="00:46:04.519" style="s2"> What are you not showing me?</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.519" end="00:46:10.309" style="s2"> I once got something from Greenpeace asking for a donation.</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.309" end="00:46:14.940" style="s2"> And the folder only contained photos of the people from the management.</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.940" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2"> I thought, &quot;Why would I want to see pictures of the people on the Greenpeace board?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:22.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:22.680" end="00:46:25.650" style="s2"> The other question is: why do they want to show that?</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.650" end="00:46:28.650" style="s2"> You don&#39;t have to think long to figure that out.</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.650" end="00:46:31.219" style="s2"> It&#39;s a matter of status.</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.219" end="00:46:35.000" style="s2"> What you would expect in such a letter is, &quot;These are six things we have done</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.000" end="00:46:41.140" style="s2"> in the past year that have improved the planet. Here&#39;s what we spent, and what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.140" end="00:46:45.989" style="s2"> administrative costs. And this is why that was a good idea. &quot;Not,&quot; These are our leaders.</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.989" end="00:46:46.989" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:46.989" end="00:46:48.950" style="s2"> Something is wrong there.</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.950" end="00:46:52.410" style="s2"> I took Greenpeace because it just happened to come to mind, but it happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.410" end="00:46:54.549" style="s2"> at all kinds of organizations.</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.549" end="00:47:04.410" style="s2"> Well, by the time it was 1900, Freud had identified many different functions of the unconscious,</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.410" end="00:47:06.759" style="s2"> and these are four.</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.759" end="00:47:12.289" style="s2"> First of all, the unconscious had a storage function, which means that it stores memories,</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.289" end="00:47:14.229" style="s2"> which are often not accessible for voluntary recall.</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.229" end="00:47:20.539" style="s2"> We don&#39;t really know how memories are stored in the brain, but this is a conjecture.</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.539" end="00:47:27.299" style="s2"> If you have an experience ... imagine that it produces a pattern of neurological activity.</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.299" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2"> Not just neurological, but a pattern of activity in your brain and in your body.</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:42.519" style="s2"> Remembering something is partially reactivating that pattern, but of course it is not that simple,</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.519" end="00:47:47.670" style="s2"> otherwise you would actually carry out your memories. We don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.670" end="00:47:53.959" style="s2"> how that first pattern of experience is processed into what you remember.</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.959" end="00:48:00.309" style="s2"> We do know that it is edited according to the relevance it has</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.309" end="00:48:02.549" style="s2"> for your current purposefulness.</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.549" end="00:48:03.819" style="s2"> How that happens?</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.819" end="00:48:06.510" style="s2"> It seems impossible to calculate.</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.510" end="00:48:09.180" style="s2"> We don&#39;t understand at all how it works.</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.180" end="00:48:13.690" style="s2"> We do not understand how you can calculate what is or is not relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.690" end="00:48:18.369" style="s2"> The world is so complex that it seems impossible.</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.369" end="00:48:19.440" style="s2"> The save function.</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.440" end="00:48:20.440" style="s2"> The decomposition function.</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.440" end="00:48:26.509" style="s2"> The unconscious contains habits that were once voluntary and are now automated. And dissociated elements</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.509" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2"> of the personality, who can lead a parasitic existence.</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:36.769" style="s2"> I&#39;ve talked about traumatic memories and how they can be a hub for development</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.769" end="00:48:40.910" style="s2"> of a subpersonality. But there is something else worth understanding.</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.910" end="00:48:48.519" style="s2"> Let&#39;s say you start practicing a little behavior modification, a new attitude</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.519" end="00:48:50.839" style="s2"> or a new trait, or a new habit.</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.839" end="00:48:53.039" style="s2"> It could be a small thing.</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.039" end="00:48:56.019" style="s2"> When you start practicing, you are not very good at it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.019" end="00:49:00.369" style="s2"> For the musicians among you, when you play a piece for the first time, you do</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.369" end="00:49:01.640" style="s2"> not very good.</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.640" end="00:49:04.119" style="s2"> The more you practice it, the better you can do it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.119" end="00:49:05.630" style="s2"> It&#39;s very strange.</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.630" end="00:49:09.579" style="s2"> I am not a good pianist, but I once learned to play a very difficult song.</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.579" end="00:49:13.019" style="s2"> But the terrible thing is that I learn to play it, and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.019" end="00:49:16.680" style="s2"> I realize I don&#39;t remember the notes, and once that happens,</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.680" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2"> I can no longer use those habit patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:22.180" style="s2"> And then I have to find out what the nuts are, very annoying.</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.180" end="00:49:26.329" style="s2"> Anyway, when you start practicing something it takes effort,</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.329" end="00:49:30.099" style="s2"> it requires a lot of brain activity, that&#39;s what the scans show.</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.099" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2"> But if you exercise a lot, the size of the brain area you use decreases.</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:40.539" style="s2"> It generally moves to the left, because the right hemisphere is more involved in processing new things.</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.539" end="00:49:44.369" style="s2"> Usually it moves to the left, then back, and the area gets smaller and smaller</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.369" end="00:49:49.309" style="s2"> until you have set up a small mechanism.</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.309" end="00:49:54.289" style="s2"> A small sub-personality of a collection of connections that takes care of that specific action.</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.289" end="00:49:59.549" style="s2"> That&#39;s interesting because in a way that means that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.549" end="00:50:03.609" style="s2"> your brain is filled with things you&#39;ve been practicing.</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.609" end="00:50:06.699" style="s2"> And that&#39;s not exactly psychological, that&#39;s psychophysiological.</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.699" end="00:50:10.729" style="s2"> It is part of your psyche, but also a network in your brain.</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.729" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2"> If you want to unlearn any of those habits, you have to build a new mechanism around that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:15.719" style="s2"> to turn off.</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.719" end="00:50:17.009" style="s2"> You cannot make it disappear.</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.009" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2"> And what often happens with that new mechanism when you are stressed is ...</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.150" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know exactly how that works.</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.150" end="00:50:28.660" style="s2"> The stress reduces the functioning of the new mechanism and the old habit</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.660" end="00:50:29.720" style="s2"> comes back again.</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.720" end="00:50:32.170" style="s2"> Some of you will have noticed this.</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.170" end="00:50:34.430" style="s2"> How many of you no longer live with your parents?</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.430" end="00:50:42.829" style="s2"> How many of you notice that when you go to your parents&#39; house, all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.829" end="00:50:49.559" style="s2"> character traits that you thought you let go of, immediately reappear?</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.559" end="00:50:52.279" style="s2"> You know that experience, right?</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.279" end="00:50:53.329" style="s2"> You go back and &quot;bam!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.329" end="00:50:55.140" style="s2"> There is a dynamic, and you are immediately in it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.140" end="00:50:59.450" style="s2"> And maybe you&#39;re as grown as a thirty year old when you&#39;re in your own home</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.450" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2"> but as soon as you get home, &quot;poof!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:02.200" style="s2"> You&#39;re fourteen again.</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.200" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2"> This is partly due to the expectations of your parents,</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:13.420" style="s2"> but also because you just don&#39;t understand how much of your behavior is automatic,</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.420" end="00:51:15.519" style="s2"> and triggered by events.</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.519" end="00:51:16.519" style="s2"> It goes without saying.</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.519" end="00:51:21.779" style="s2"> You can also see that as dissociated elements of the personality.</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.779" end="00:51:23.349" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:23.349" end="00:51:24.349" style="s2"> The creative function.</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.349" end="00:51:28.339" style="s2"> The unconscious is the matrix for new ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.339" end="00:51:35.509" style="s2"> That&#39;s a more Jungian idea. It seems to work like this ... Ask yourself:</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.509" end="00:51:37.279" style="s2"> &quot;How are you able to come up with a new idea?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.279" end="00:51:39.469" style="s2"> That&#39;s not right, right?</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.469" end="00:51:42.849" style="s2"> Because are you making something appear out of nowhere?</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.849" end="00:51:48.049" style="s2"> You can say that they are combinations of old ideas, but that doesn&#39;t really help.</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.049" end="00:51:51.809" style="s2"> Because you can&#39;t just take some old ideas, shake them up, and so on new</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.809" end="00:51:53.369" style="s2"> come up with spectacular ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.369" end="00:51:56.249" style="s2"> It is much more complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.249" end="00:52:01.010" style="s2"> You can see it like this ...</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.010" end="00:52:05.959" style="s2"> Freud, in a sense, explored the surface of the creative unconscious,</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.959" end="00:52:07.640" style="s2"> he was more concerned with ...</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.640" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2"> Jung called the Freudian unconscious the &quot;personal unconscious.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:16.809" style="s2"> That is the unconscious you have that is connected to your experiences,</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.809" end="00:52:18.630" style="s2"> aware and unaware.</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.630" end="00:52:19.869" style="s2"> That can be very deep.</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.869" end="00:52:26.269" style="s2"> Jung once had a dream (hopefully I remember well) that he and Freud</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.269" end="00:52:32.009" style="s2"> were excavating the basement of a building. And Jung broke through somewhere and found</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.009" end="00:52:34.069" style="s2"> a huge structure underneath.</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.069" end="00:52:35.670" style="s2"> And that is more or less exactly right.</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.670" end="00:52:40.770" style="s2"> So there is the personal unconscious, and below that, in theory,</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.770" end="00:52:42.539" style="s2"> there is what Jung called the &quot;collective unconscious&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.539" end="00:52:45.470" style="s2"> And that&#39;s ... God knows.</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.470" end="00:52:51.380" style="s2"> What it is in part is what makes you human from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.380" end="00:52:52.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:52.380" end="00:52:57.579" style="s2"> You have a specific mode of existence, which is a human mode of existence.</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.580" end="00:53:06.840" style="s2"> I think it was EO Wilson, an important entomologist, who was also at the beginning of sociobiology,</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.840" end="00:53:16.120" style="s2"> a branch of evolutionary psychology ... He studied ants, for a very long time, the social behavior of ants.</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.120" end="00:53:23.040" style="s2"> And he said, &quot;If we could talk to ants, we&#39;d have nothing to say to them.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.060" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2"> He meant ... ants are interested in things that you are not interested in at all.</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:39.140" style="s2"> They don&#39;t get jealous, they don&#39;t fall in love, they don&#39;t have a sexual feeling or behavior, they are not cognitive beings.</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.140" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2"> What the hell are you talking about with an ant?</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:44.860" style="s2"> &quot;How&#39;s wearing that grain of sand?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.860" end="00:53:46.860" style="s2"> An ant doesn&#39;t care about that.</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.860" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s interesting, it&#39;s an astute observation,</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:54:00.120" style="s2"> for it indicates that you cannot communicate with anyone unless you are 99 percent the same.</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.120" end="00:54:06.660" style="s2"> To communicate with someone means sharing a very large set of assumptions.</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.660" end="00:54:14.140" style="s2"> For example, when I say, &quot;I got jealous of a party last week.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.140" end="00:54:18.420" style="s2"> Then you won&#39;t say, &quot;What do you mean by jealous?&quot; That will not be your question.</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.420" end="00:54:23.980" style="s2"> You will ask, &quot;What circumstances triggered that response?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.980" end="00:54:30.500" style="s2"> I don&#39;t have to explain anger. I don&#39;t have to explain playfulness, hunger ... all basic human motivations</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.500" end="00:54:35.060" style="s2"> that you see in a typical adventure movie or romantic comedy.</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.080" end="00:54:37.980" style="s2"> They need no explanation, because we are the same.</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.980" end="00:54:44.320" style="s2"> And that similarity constitutes the essence of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.320" end="00:54:54.040" style="s2"> Jung&#39;s hypothesis was that you are not only biologically structured when it comes to your morphology and physiology,</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.040" end="00:55:00.600" style="s2"> but that, which also extends into your brain structure, and even beyond, into the content of your psyche,</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.600" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2"> or at least in the way your psyche organizes itself over time.</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2"> It seems a hypothesis so self-evident that it seems almost inconceivable that it has been disputed for so long.</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:21.020" style="s2"> But the experimental psychologists were very much influenced by the behaviorists,</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.020" end="00:55:28.380" style="s2"> and the behaviorists postulated, partly ideologically and partly for the sake of scientific simplicity,</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.380" end="00:55:34.060" style="s2"> that people were a blank slate, and that we were nothing more than what we learned.</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.060" end="00:55:42.560" style="s2"> There is a book out called &quot;Human Universals,&quot; unfortunately I can&#39;t remember the name of the writer now ....</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.560" end="00:55:50.820" style="s2"> It&#39;s a sociological / anthropological book, and that person has collected human correspondences.</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.820" end="00:56:00.660" style="s2"> What all people everywhere have in common. We all wear clothes. Sometimes for protection, and in any case for ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.660" end="00:56:05.880" style="s2"> People form couples, people fall in love, the basic emotions are the same.</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.880" end="00:56:12.200" style="s2"> We use fire, that&#39;s important. Other animals cannot.</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.200" end="00:56:20.680" style="s2"> There are literally dozens of universal aspects that people share, and that is part of the structure of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.680" end="00:56:25.360" style="s2"> Anyway, back to the idea of ​​creativity.</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.360" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2"> Your creative act is your attempt to connect the uniqueness of your experience with the uniqueness of your culture,</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:45.960" style="s2"> and the more general phenomena and modes of being that you share with other people.</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.960" end="00:56:54.560" style="s2"> Because you come into the world and have your own perspective, you have access to information that is not accessible to anyone else.</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.560" end="00:57:00.460" style="s2"> To some extent, that can be the basis for your creativity, that information.</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.460" end="00:57:06.440" style="s2"> But to communicate that, which is also part of creativity ...</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.440" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2"> If you are creative without anyone understanding you, then you are more schizophrenic than creative.</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2"> You have free associations, but you cannot produce a coherent story.</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:25.240" style="s2"> You have to integrate that unique information into the cultural knowledge, the cultural narratives, and anchor it in universal human biology,</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.240" end="00:57:27.900" style="s2"> and you can present that as a creative act.</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.900" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2"> That is a possible source of creativity. Now another one.</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.380" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2"> We&#39;ve talked about Piaget. And Piaget said that in order to understand something, you start with physical action.</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:51.320" style="s2"> You represent the world with your body. By sitting in a chair, you represent the chair with your body.</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.320" end="00:57:57.020" style="s2"> By walking through a door, you represent the door with your body. When you grab a glass, you do the same.</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.020" end="00:58:04.260" style="s2"> You tune in, you imitate the world constantly. You map it to your physiological structure.</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.260" end="00:58:09.460" style="s2"> So that you get a feeling ... that&#39;s what understanding means.</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.460" end="00:58:14.740" style="s2"> Because that is a complicated concept to understand. What does it mean to understand something?</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.740" end="00:58:19.320" style="s2"> It means having a grip on something. We don&#39;t use those words for no reason.</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.320" end="00:58:26.120" style="s2"> It means that you are firm in your relationship with it. You can deal with it. Those kind of things.</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.740" end="00:58:34.280" style="s2"> That is the beginning, but you can also imitate. You can imitate yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.280" end="00:58:38.220" style="s2"> You do that when you repeat experiences that had a positive result.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.220" end="00:58:40.280" style="s2"> But you can also imitate other people.</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.280" end="00:58:43.660" style="s2"> But then you think, &quot;Who are those people imitating?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.660" end="00:59:00.380" style="s2"> The answer to that is: we are LED screens, as it were, with continuously flowing imitations of imitations, on our physiological surface.</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.380" end="00:59:09.900" style="s2"> You are the result of a very long evolutionary development, but you are also the result of a very long development of imitation.</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.900" end="00:59:19.380" style="s2"> What you mimic is your culture. You can see your culture as something with a complex personality, the personality of your ancestors.</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.380" end="00:59:23.000" style="s2"> That&#39;s how you can see it. And you imitate that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.000" end="00:59:32.520" style="s2"> That is why we call our laws a &quot;corpus&quot; (body). And you can say that the legislation, especially the English &quot;common law,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.520" end="00:59:40.100" style="s2"> is the articulated representation of imitation customs and rituals of all of society.</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.100" end="00:59:44.560" style="s2"> It is put into full wording. But it was already there.</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.140" end="00:59:57.420" style="s2"> So what you partly derive your creativity material from is by observing the behavior and interaction between all people,</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.420" end="01:00:00.780" style="s2"> which all humans have imitated since the beginning of time.</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.780" end="01:00:05.800" style="s2"> And that is extremely educational. Much more educational than you can ever represent.</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.800" end="01:00:12.040" style="s2"> You know how much information someone can give by raising their eyebrow half an inch.</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.040" end="01:00:18.180" style="s2"> That can indicate irony. It can indicate that a joke is associated with a collection of other jokes that they know you like.</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.180" end="01:00:23.420" style="s2"> It is very complex, you cannot articulate all of that. But somehow you know.</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.420" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2"> You participate in that game.</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.400" end="01:00:32.180" style="s2"> Imagine you embody all of that, insofar as you are a sophisticated player.</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.180" end="01:00:41.240" style="s2"> Then your imagination represents you and the world. That&#39;s an abstraction, because your imagination is not the world.</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.240" end="01:00:43.900" style="s2"> It is a representation of the world.</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.900" end="01:00:51.200" style="s2"> What you can do next ... in the imagination there is all kinds of information about imitation behavior,</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.200" end="01:00:54.520" style="s2"> and thus you can talk about the image.</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.520" end="01:00:57.020" style="s2"> That&#39;s what you do when you interpret a dream.</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.020" end="01:00:59.020" style="s2"> What is your dream doing?</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.020" end="01:01:03.260" style="s2"> Your imagination looks at how you move through the world.</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.260" end="01:01:05.460" style="s2"> And you have your categories, systems, theories, et cetera.</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.460" end="01:01:14.280" style="s2"> And the dream creates a visual representation of what that could mean.</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.280" end="01:01:19.020" style="s2"> In this foreign language, a language loaded with images.</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.020" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2"> It can be completely disjointed, containing only sequential images, but also include incredibly complex and refined full storylines.</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:35.880" style="s2"> This is part of the process in which the information anchored in you and the culture, on a behavioral level,</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.880" end="01:01:40.080" style="s2"> moves up into the imagination, and then appears in the articulated domain.</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.080" end="01:01:44.040" style="s2"> So you have a dream about you. And then you talk about the dream.</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.040" end="01:01:48.940" style="s2"> What are you doing then? You try to translate the images into articulated representations.</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.940" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2"> And that&#39;s also a good way to conceptualize how memory moves from the bottom to the top.</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:02:02.100" style="s2"> Which is interesting ... sometimes you realize, you realize something, or at some point you get an insight,</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.100" end="01:02:06.380" style="s2"> and that comes with a feeling. Some kind of electric charge.</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.380" end="01:02:15.460" style="s2"> I think you get that charge because you simplify something, but also because of the new possibilities that appear as a result of that realization.</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.460" end="01:02:24.740" style="s2"> What seems to be happening is ... there is the behavioral realm, what you embody, and all the things you imitate, it&#39;s very complex ...</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.740" end="01:02:33.420" style="s2"> and above that is the image of it. And you&#39;re trying to get the picture right, but that&#39;s very difficult because this changes, and that&#39;s smooth.</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.420" end="01:02:38.760" style="s2"> You try to get it in order, and above that you try to correctly order your articulated representations.</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.760" end="01:02:42.520" style="s2"> So you can talk about what you know about who you are.</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.520" end="01:02:46.800" style="s2"> And when that all comes together, you think, &quot;I&#39;ve got myself in order.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.800" end="01:02:53.140" style="s2"> But every now and then you will have a hunch, like the woman I told you about who was abused.</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.140" end="01:02:55.900" style="s2"> The insight was, &quot;I was a small child, but so was my brother.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.900" end="01:03:02.080" style="s2"> &quot;Anxious!&quot; All kinds of things that didn&#39;t seem right suddenly fall into place.</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.080" end="01:03:12.700" style="s2"> You get an articulate representation that can summarize all kinds of apparently different and separate image representations.</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.700" end="01:03:15.320" style="s2"> And suddenly it is much clearer how to proceed.</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.320" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2"> Because you know more about who you are and know more about where you are going.</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:26.600" style="s2"> That&#39;s what psychoanalysis is all about. And that is certainly the case with dream analysis.</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.600" end="01:03:28.600" style="s2"> Freud was also a pioneer in that area.</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.600" end="01:03:32.900" style="s2"> Freud thought dreams were wish fulfillment.</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.080" end="01:03:40.540" style="s2"> He thought the function of dreams as wish fulfillment was to protect sleep.</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.540" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2"> For example, maybe you are very thirsty, you go to sleep, and you dream about drinking water.</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:54.360" style="s2"> Those of you who drank too much beer the night before may be familiar with such dreams.</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.360" end="01:03:58.520" style="s2"> So you dream that you are looking for and drinking fountains.</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.520" end="01:04:08.940" style="s2"> And Freud&#39;s interpretation of that was: you must stay asleep, and therefore the dream provides</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.940" end="01:04:17.840" style="s2"> your underlying &quot;id-related&quot; motivation system, such as that which controls thirst, of the fulfillment of its desire.</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.840" end="01:04:21.400" style="s2"> But I think that&#39;s wrong. Though it is strange,</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.400" end="01:04:26.280" style="s2"> because dreams could do different things. But what seems to be happening instead ...</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.289" end="01:04:33.109" style="s2"> I especially realized this when I heard about an investigation into the effects</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.109" end="01:04:37.569" style="s2"> of testosterone, the cycle of testosterone, on female sexual activity.</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.569" end="01:04:44.369" style="s2"> So it goes like this. In women the testosterone level varies during the monthly cycle,</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.369" end="01:04:52.779" style="s2"> and also their desire for sex. What seems to happen when the testosterone increases is not that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.779" end="01:04:59.920" style="s2"> the frequency of sexual acts necessarily increases, but the frequency of sexual fantasies increases.</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.920" end="01:05:05.019" style="s2"> So the hormone drives the fantasies, and the fantasies drive the behavior, something like that.</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.019" end="01:05:10.380" style="s2"> So the dream does not fulfill a wish, what happened ...</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.380" end="01:05:17.260" style="s2"> that&#39;s how the motivation system manifests itself as an action plan.</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.260" end="01:05:22.059" style="s2"> You should look for sources of water when you are thirsty.</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.059" end="01:05:27.140" style="s2"> Your hypothalamus has to communicate with you in some way.</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.140" end="01:05:33.009" style="s2"> He does not take over your behavior, to control you like a robot. He must declare</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.009" end="01:05:38.480" style="s2"> What state you are in, he does that in different ways, and then you direction</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.480" end="01:05:42.229" style="s2"> making solutions move. Through your memories, your skills, and everything connected</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.229" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2"> with successful outcomes of that form in the past.</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.799" end="01:05:52.670" style="s2"> Another thing I have to say about creativity, and this is very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.670" end="01:05:58.009" style="s2"> to understand how people react to psychoanalysis ... I have a lot of creative people</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.009" end="01:06:03.259" style="s2"> among my clients, for various reasons, and some who are not creative. And creativity is</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.259" end="01:06:10.099" style="s2"> a personality trait. Most people are not creative. It is not very common. And some people who are creative</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.099" end="01:06:17.689" style="s2"> are so creative it is incomprehensible. Picasso for example</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.689" end="01:06:28.690" style="s2"> made 65 thousand works of art, three a day for sixty-five years. That man was creative.</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.690" end="01:06:32.650" style="s2"> Many people are not creative, and they are not interested in psychoanalytic ideas.</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.650" end="01:06:36.269" style="s2"> They are not interested in archetypal ideas, they are not really in the throes of stories.</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.269" end="01:06:41.769" style="s2"> So if you happen to ... by the way, an indication for creativity, for openness, is to like fiction.</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.769" end="01:06:48.429" style="s2"> Women like fiction more than men, because women</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.429" end="01:06:54.929" style="s2"> score higher on an aspect of openness than men. And what else? If you like poetry</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.929" end="01:07:00.699" style="s2"> if that gives you an aesthetic experience, if you find music compelling,</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.699" end="01:07:06.279" style="s2"> if you are able to produce things that are creative. If you have a ghost</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.279" end="01:07:12.369" style="s2"> that works associatively. For example, if I said to you, &quot;Write down as many words as possible,</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.369" end="01:07:17.020" style="s2"> the next three minutes, starting with the letter L. &quot;Those who are more creative</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.020" end="01:07:21.479" style="s2"> will come up with more words. So there is also an element of verbal ability.</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.479" end="01:07:28.299" style="s2"> I could say, &quot;How many ways can you use a brick?&quot; And I would give points for that.</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.299" end="01:07:32.979" style="s2"> First for how many possibilities you have come up with, just the number.</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.979" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2"> The nonsensical possibilities, which make no sense, are dropped. And often you need a panel,</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:43.989" style="s2"> to judge that. Because you may say, &quot;You can use it as one thing.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.989" end="01:07:50.199" style="s2"> Uh, no, you don&#39;t get points for that. And then you get a different score for it</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.199" end="01:07:56.299" style="s2"> how unusual your answer was. That&#39;s about originality. And if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.299" end="01:08:02.180" style="s2"> that calculates two dimensions, quantity and originality, based on such an alternative thinking task,</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.180" end="01:08:06.599" style="s2"> as I just described it, you can predict quite well how creative people are.</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.599" end="01:08:10.069" style="s2"> The very creative people seem like one</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.069" end="01:08:14.599" style="s2"> to have a deep source of unconscious ideas that are constantly emerging,</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.599" end="01:08:19.750" style="s2"> and some of those people dream very much. And they have very delicate and complex dreams,</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.750" end="01:08:26.680" style="s2"> and those dreams seem to guide their behavior. And that is very entertaining to watch</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.680" end="01:08:30.720" style="s2"> during psychotherapy. If you find that kind of thing interesting. You may ask:</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.720" end="01:08:35.750" style="s2"> &quot;How do you know if your dream interpretation is correct?&quot; The answer is:</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.750" end="01:08:42.580" style="s2"> how do you know if you have correctly interpreted the last book you read? You do not know,</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.580" end="01:08:47.700" style="s2"> and if you did, you don&#39;t know how.</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.700" end="01:08:51.560" style="s2"> Because many people can read a book and interpret it somewhat differently.</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.560" end="01:08:56.850" style="s2"> You can consider the book as a layered pattern.</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.850" end="01:09:00.940" style="s2"> And the reader too is a layered pattern. And when you put the two together</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.940" end="01:09:05.190" style="s2"> you get a layered pattern made up of the reader and the book, and you will</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.190" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2"> are unique with every reader. But we also have common structures</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:15.251" style="s2"> through which we can communicate about it. So you read the book and it hits you</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.251" end="01:09:18.670" style="s2"> some things hit you, and some things seem right. If you interpret a dream</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.670" end="01:09:24.069" style="s2"> you work with the client on the interpretation.</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.069" end="01:09:30.600" style="s2"> What I usually do is people tell me their dream from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.600" end="01:09:35.500" style="s2"> Freud would say you introduce all kinds of assumptions right away, because they don&#39;t tell you the dream,</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.500" end="01:09:40.359" style="s2"> they tell you the dream as they interpret and remember it.</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.359" end="01:09:44.750" style="s2"> Yes, that is a problem. But you do what you can.</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.750" end="01:09:48.530" style="s2"> I tell people, &quot;Write it down as soon as you can, without thinking too much about it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.530" end="01:09:54.290" style="s2"> Because we don&#39;t want any subsequent edits. Then I listen to it and they tell it</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.290" end="01:09:59.620" style="s2"> again, slowly. Then I listen to a sentence, and I let my ability to associate work,</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.620" end="01:10:04.900" style="s2"> and then I see what that reminds me of, and then I ask the person</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.900" end="01:10:09.710" style="s2"> what it reminds him of. And then we talk about that. Those are the direct associations,</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.710" end="01:10:13.920" style="s2"> the things Freud would call free associations. And you can say that</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:19.380" style="s2"> around every utterance, such as a sentence, there is a collection of potential meanings.</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.380" end="01:10:24.330" style="s2"> These can be direct meanings, strongly related to it,</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.330" end="01:10:30.030" style="s2"> and loose meanings. The client and therapist can continue to exchange thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.030" end="01:10:34.620" style="s2"> until you think, &quot;Okay, it seems to be heading that way.&quot; And you can see it too</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.620" end="01:10:39.480" style="s2"> in relation to the person&#39;s actual experiences, and the rest of the dream,</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.480" end="01:10:44.460" style="s2"> and maybe all the dreams he&#39;s told you before. So it is extremely complex.</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.460" end="01:10:48.650" style="s2"> But people also do that when they listen to a conversation. How do you know if</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.650" end="01:10:55.740" style="s2"> your interpretation of a conversation is correct? There are several ways</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.740" end="01:11:00.370" style="s2"> to approach that, but you&#39;re not sure. There are many different ways</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.370" end="01:11:05.100" style="s2"> to interpret a conversation. That&#39;s why the Postmodernists in one</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.100" end="01:11:09.810" style="s2"> black hole with regard to literature. They realized there is no limit to the amount of manners</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.810" end="01:11:14.830" style="s2"> to interpret a book. But then they took it a step further:</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.830" end="01:11:22.140" style="s2"> &quot;Therefore it has no meaning.&quot; No, incorrect. That&#39;s a simplistic way of thinking.</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.140" end="01:11:27.940" style="s2"> It means that the way the book conveys meaning is very complex,</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.940" end="01:11:32.700" style="s2"> you cannot describe it on the basis of normal, linear rationality. That&#39;s not to say there is no meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.700" end="01:11:37.650" style="s2"> That is so sad. It&#39;s such a sad theory. And it&#39;s dangerous too</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.650" end="01:11:42.130" style="s2"> for it means that nothing has meaning, and that is the most dangerous theory.</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.130" end="01:11:47.710" style="s2"> Either way, you talk to the person about the dream and the dream image, and about</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.710" end="01:11:54.020" style="s2"> what that evokes memories. And you also pay attention to what they say because sometimes ...</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.020" end="01:11:58.760" style="s2"> For example, this happened recently, someone is describing a dream</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.760" end="01:12:02.950" style="s2"> where he&#39;s walking around, and he says, &quot;I&#39;m on the wrong road.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.950" end="01:12:06.780" style="s2"> And you think, &quot;Okay.&quot; Now we know what your dream means because</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.780" end="01:12:12.030" style="s2"> you just said it. &quot;I&#39;m on the wrong track.&quot; That&#39;s a Freudian slip of the tongue.</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.030" end="01:12:16.100" style="s2"> That&#39;s interesting because if you listen to how people tell their dreams, you have to listen to ...</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.100" end="01:12:21.300" style="s2"> it is as if they have two spirits speaking at the same time. One describes the dream,</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.300" end="01:12:25.260" style="s2"> but the other describes his life, and they don&#39;t see the connection.</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.260" end="01:12:29.030" style="s2"> And you point it out, and they say, &quot;Oh, yeah, I didn&#39;t realize I was saying that.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.030" end="01:12:33.540" style="s2"> That&#39;s a Freudian slip of the tongue. What&#39;s happening is ... the right hemisphere of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.540" end="01:12:40.210" style="s2"> is a system that collects images, a kind of system that collects low-resolution patterns,</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.210" end="01:12:45.160" style="s2"> that mainly uses images and tries to create meaningful coherence,</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.160" end="01:12:51.270" style="s2"> but that meaning is vague and comprehensive. And the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.270" end="01:12:56.500" style="s2"> the linguistic hemisphere tries to make clear what that means, but in words.</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.500" end="01:13:01.790" style="s2"> It&#39;s very difficult to make that transition, but that&#39;s why dream analysis works in part.</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.790" end="01:13:06.700" style="s2"> Because you allow the information to move from images</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.700" end="01:13:12.380" style="s2"> to the articulated part of the personality. You move information up the hierarchy of abstraction,</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.380" end="01:13:18.770" style="s2"> to the point where it can be used. I will conclude this discussion of Freud</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.770" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2"> with a description of research that has been carried out recently,</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:31.970" style="s2"> relatively recently, for the past twenty years, by a psychologist at the University of Texas,</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.970" end="01:13:38.450" style="s2"> in Austin, called James Pennebaker. And Pennebaker is a very smart psychologist.</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.450" end="01:13:43.310" style="s2"> Freud had another idea related to therapy. He thought</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.310" end="01:13:46.942" style="s2"> that if you were undergoing therapy and talked about a traumatic event,</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.942" end="01:13:53.850" style="s2"> that you were then healed by &quot;catharsis.&quot; That meant the trauma was linked to a collection of feelings,</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.850" end="01:13:57.680" style="s2"> who were oppressed, but who tried to rise from the depths,</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.680" end="01:14:01.441" style="s2"> and caused all kinds of stress and misery because you tried to stop them. And if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.441" end="01:14:07.590" style="s2"> talking to someone about it and expressing your feelings would help you.</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.590" end="01:14:13.540" style="s2"> Expressing your feelings doesn&#39;t help, by the way. That turns out to be wrong, but</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.540" end="01:14:17.790" style="s2"> it is wrong in an interesting and useful way. Because it is almost right.</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.790" end="01:14:24.020" style="s2"> Pennebaker dropped &quot;undergraduates&quot; for three consecutive days</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.020" end="01:14:29.490" style="s2"> come to the study, and had them write for 15 minutes every day,</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.490" end="01:14:32.941" style="s2"> about the worst thing they had ever done or experienced.</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.941" end="01:14:37.730" style="s2"> Often people are traumatized by something they&#39;ve done, not something they&#39;ve been through.</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.730" end="01:14:42.140" style="s2"> More often, because someone sees themselves doing something terrible,</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.140" end="01:14:47.650" style="s2"> and thinks, &quot;My God, that&#39;s what I did! Who am I?&quot; They have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.650" end="01:14:53.320" style="s2"> and then things start to collapse. Anyway, Pennebaker let them do that,</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.320" end="01:14:56.700" style="s2"> and for the next two weeks they were pretty miserable. That is interesting,</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.700" end="01:15:01.260" style="s2"> because if they only measured the result of that intervention in those two weeks,</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.260" end="01:15:05.850" style="s2"> everyone would have said, &quot;Never write down your traumatic experiences,</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.850" end="01:15:11.100" style="s2"> because that makes it worse. ”But in the six months after that, what happened in particular,</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.100" end="01:15:15.330" style="s2"> was that their physical health improved. They went to the doctor less, they were</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.330" end="01:15:19.180" style="s2"> less often sick, et cetera. That was because their general stress level decreased,</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.180" end="01:15:24.750" style="s2"> for complex reasons that we can talk about later. And Pennebaker, a good scientist, thought:</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.750" end="01:15:29.970" style="s2"> &quot;Okay, catharsis works.&quot; You are venting your trauma, and &quot;poof!&quot; it is solved.</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.970" end="01:15:35.120" style="s2"> But then he thought, &quot;Wait a minute, maybe it&#39;s important how you express it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.120" end="01:15:39.130" style="s2"> So he went back and counted all the words that had to do with emotion,</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.130" end="01:15:44.680" style="s2"> and all words related to understanding and cognition. And he discovered two things:</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.680" end="01:15:50.980" style="s2"> the more words you used, as your story developed,</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.980" end="01:15:55.810" style="s2"> that indicated insight and understanding, the better you were, in the long run.</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.810" end="01:16:01.460" style="s2"> It&#39;s not about expressing your feelings, it&#39;s about expressing</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.460" end="01:16:09.940" style="s2"> your feelings and weaving the memory into a new coherent representation,</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.940" end="01:16:15.750" style="s2"> from which you derive a moral. So what&#39;s the moral of trauma? &quot;Don&#39;t let it happen again!&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.750" end="01:16:20.620" style="s2"> That is the message. And the threat systems will keep bugging you with that,</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.620" end="01:16:25.720" style="s2"> until you fix it. &quot;How did I get into it? How do I keep it from happening in the future?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.720" end="01:16:29.390" style="s2"> That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s your fault, but your fear systems aren&#39;t interested in that.</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.390" end="01:16:34.040" style="s2"> They want to prevent you from falling into the same hole.</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.040" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2"> And the only way to do that is analyze the causal relationships that brought you to that hole,</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.760" end="01:16:42.690" style="s2"> and see if you can change your behavior and attitude,</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.690" end="01:16:49.210" style="s2"> so that it no longer happens, or avoid such situations. One of the two.</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.210" end="01:16:56.640" style="s2"> The &quot;trauma alarm systems&quot; ... once you have an insightful representation,</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.640" end="01:17:01.600" style="s2"> what you are convinced of, they will leave you alone. And that can happen very quickly.</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.600" end="01:17:05.580" style="s2"> Like with nightmares. I cured people from nightmares in one session, no problem.</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.580" end="01:17:12.680" style="s2"> I ask them to conjure up the nightmare in their imagination. Maybe they are being chased.</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.680" end="01:17:18.400" style="s2"> &quot;Okay, imagine they&#39;re after you. You have to visualize it, really visualize it.</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.400" end="01:17:22.020" style="s2"> The more realistic the better. Okay, you&#39;re being chased. How do you feel?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.020" end="01:17:27.310" style="s2"> &quot;I am very tense and scared.&quot; &quot;All right, turn around and see what is chasing you.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.310" end="01:17:32.100" style="s2"> So they do. And then they possibly tell you what it is, but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.100" end="01:17:36.540" style="s2"> they don&#39;t even do that. And then I say, &quot;Before you go to sleep tonight, just before you fall asleep,</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.540" end="01:17:40.710" style="s2"> you are in a hypnagogic state in which images will appear, and then you do. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.710" end="01:17:45.400" style="s2"> So they do that and &quot;poof,&quot; gone nightmare.</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.400" end="01:17:50.870" style="s2"> And that&#39;s because they reprogrammed themselves as ... not as something to be haunted,</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.870" end="01:17:55.610" style="s2"> like a prey, but like something that can turn around,</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.610" end="01:18:02.430" style="s2"> and confront what is haunting them. And that&#39;s the same motive as</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.430" end="01:18:06.770" style="s2"> the hunt for the dragon in the jungian archetypes. Face what you fear and it will heal you.</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.770" end="01:18:11.830" style="s2"> And that is one of the fundamental motives of Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.830" end="01:18:18.710" style="s2"> There is a test on Thursday. I will post representative questions on the internet</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.710" end="01:18:26.630" style="s2"> when I get home after this lecture, probably tonight. The test will take place here and will be multiple choice.</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.630" end="01:18:30.460" style="s2"> It will not be a problem to get it done on time, it is not that big.</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.460" end="01:18:36.220" style="s2"> If you have read the literature and attended the lectures, you will probably be fine. It&#39;s not an insidious test.</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.220" end="01:18:36.720" style="s2"></p>
