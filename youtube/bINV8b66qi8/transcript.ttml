<p begin="00:00:00.770" end="00:00:07.290" style="s2">all right so this is queerness part two</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.069" end="00:00:09.480" style="s2">part of what happens when I encounter</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.290" end="00:00:11.700" style="s2">people that were non-binary especially</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.480" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">this is my language females that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.700" end="00:00:20.970" style="s2">non-binary was that there was this I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">attracted to them it&#39;s put it bluntly I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.970" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">was definitely attracted to them and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:27.029" style="s2">didn&#39;t know whether it was because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:31.349" style="s2">wanted to be them or I wanted to be with</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.029" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">them and it became to the point where it</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.349" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s both of those things</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:38.399" style="s2">it can be both but I had to break from</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:42.030" style="s2">this heteronormative that masculine not</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.399" end="00:00:44.070" style="s2">just with feminine and I realized how</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.030" end="00:00:47.070" style="s2">much of my life as a heterosexual woman</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">I was trying to be something to attract</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.070" end="00:00:52.760" style="s2">a heterosexual man and when I came to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">the realization I was queer and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.760" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">attracted to different genders I gave</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">that up I was like I&#39;m not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">anything besides Who I am and whoever</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:04.189" style="s2">that attracts great and whoever it</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">doesn&#39;t whoever it turns off even better</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.189" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">I love my coming-out story to myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:11.850" style="s2">because I don&#39;t live in closets I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">do closet so once I know I&#39;m something</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.850" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">everybody knows I&#39;m something</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">what Sonny was autistic everyone else I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">want to say was I was queer everyone I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">was a queer but I was watching orange is</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">the new black and there was this really</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">beautiful romantic scene between two of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:30.950" style="s2">the women in it I was like oh do I get</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">to go to prison and have a girlfriend</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.950" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">like you know you are allowed to have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">girlfriend not go to prison like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">about the queerest thought somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">could have you&#39;re queer and and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:48.390" style="s2">was out I was out to myself and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">eventually came out to my family</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">not eventually just like the next time I</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">talked to them I was basically like</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">remember what I came out and like you</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">haven&#39;t tell me I was like oh right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">I guess right now my siblings kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">already knew I was he I was gay before I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:03.979" style="s2">did which probably made it last longer</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:07.190" style="s2">me not knowing because it was like this</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.979" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">I&#39;m not what do you mean no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.190" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">aspect to it but it also I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:16.799" style="s2">had been critical of one of my family</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:20.129" style="s2">members who came out later in life</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.799" end="00:02:21.540" style="s2">because he&#39;s kind of asexual and I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.129" end="00:02:23.219" style="s2">like yeah okay so now you&#39;re gonna not</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.540" end="00:02:25.560" style="s2">date men like you don&#39;t eat you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.219" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">know date women I had a roommate at one</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:30.090" style="s2">point in time who was both poly and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:32.459" style="s2">asexual and I was like you can&#39;t be both</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.090" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">of those things and this is where my</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.459" end="00:02:35.939" style="s2">karma always comes into play because</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:40.250" style="s2">whenever I&#39;m critical of someone else</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.939" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">again becomes my life and so I am both</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.250" end="00:02:48.299" style="s2">coming came out as queer late like</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">mid-30s and I am both demisexual which</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.299" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">is on the asexual spectrum and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">what be Paulie - and I have not in any</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">way actually like physically in the real</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:02:59.359" style="s2">world explored those things because of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:03.060" style="s2">my disability and being a single mom I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.359" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">keep to myself but there isn&#39;t enough of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.060" end="00:03:07.799" style="s2">an incentive as a demisexual to go out</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:09.299" style="s2">I&#39;m perfectly happy being single and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.799" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">would love a partner both of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.299" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">things are simultaneously my body and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">am kind of non-binary gender with like</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:22.799" style="s2">the masculine feminine I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">neither I&#39;m both I don&#39;t know you asked</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.799" end="00:03:27.540" style="s2">me on the day me and I&#39;m attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:31.979" style="s2">people who are also</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.540" end="00:03:35.819" style="s2">non-binary mainly and then also</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.979" end="00:03:37.919" style="s2">masculine and I&#39;m not really attracted</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.819" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">to the feminine but sometimes I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.919" end="00:03:40.979" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s just like who shows up</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">and it&#39;s their energy there&#39;s a cup</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.979" end="00:03:45.239" style="s2">handful of people who are feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:46.709" style="s2">enough like I love you you&#39;re so awesome</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.239" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">and not in a way that I love my friends</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.709" end="00:03:50.699" style="s2">who are also awesome and it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.639" style="s2">it&#39;s just like in the moment not needing</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.699" end="00:03:55.620" style="s2">it to be anything because I came from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.639" end="00:03:57.409" style="s2">very strong like this is how it is these</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.620" end="00:04:01.079" style="s2">are the rules in fact there were rules</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.409" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">that because I wasn&#39;t that I couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.079" end="00:04:04.620" style="s2">gay because yet I didn&#39;t have those same</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:07.470" style="s2">rules for my heterosexuality and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.620" end="00:04:08.909" style="s2">applied to both he&#39;s like oh wait no no</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.470" end="00:04:14.310" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.909" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">and so I both identify as queer and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.310" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">have never kissed a girl and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">know if I well I don&#39;t know if that if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:23.099" style="s2">need to get healthy again if I need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">not have that be stressful in order to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.099" end="00:04:28.139" style="s2">do it I&#39;m just taking it as it goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:29.970" style="s2">and enjoying as I explained when I came</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.139" end="00:04:31.770" style="s2">out like my imaginary boyfriend has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.970" end="00:04:34.620" style="s2">replaced by imaginary girlfriend or an</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.770" end="00:04:37.050" style="s2">imaginary partner like that&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.620" end="00:04:38.370" style="s2">it goes and that like that was part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.050" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">what I was critical about with other</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.370" end="00:04:42.270" style="s2">people isn&#39;t like you can&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:44.819" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually done stuff come on like</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.270" end="00:04:47.250" style="s2">no it&#39;s a it&#39;s an inner world if I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.819" end="00:04:49.080" style="s2">on a deserted island and came to those</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.250" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">realizations it wouldn&#39;t make it less</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.080" end="00:04:52.879" style="s2">real and I&#39;m a little bit on a deserted</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:56.060" style="s2">island in my own life at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.879" end="00:04:58.949" style="s2">online dating doesn&#39;t work for me but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.060" end="00:05:01.110" style="s2">can imagine a online dating that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.949" end="00:05:04.110" style="s2">work and so when we create that I might</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.110" end="00:05:09.210" style="s2">use it and until then I&#39;m kind of good</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.110" end="00:05:11.550" style="s2">I&#39;m good being me and exploring it I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:15.169" style="s2">at calmness and not forcing it but this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.550" end="00:05:15.169" style="s2">was part two of queerness</p>
