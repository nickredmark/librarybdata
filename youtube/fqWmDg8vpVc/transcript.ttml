<p begin="00:00:01.040" end="00:00:06.509" style="s2">so the book I want to share with you</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.210" end="00:00:08.849" style="s2">today is the success of open source by</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.509" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">Steven Weber and this is a book about</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.849" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">the way that open source software arose</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.570" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">within the technology world and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">eventually spread to other domains of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:21.630" style="s2">human activity in different market and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:25.259" style="s2">governmental settings and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">makes this book so helpful for those of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.259" end="00:00:29.310" style="s2">us trying to create a large scale social</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">change is that the rise of open-source</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.310" end="00:00:34.410" style="s2">software is looked at through the lens</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:36.120" style="s2">of what is called political economy so</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.410" end="00:00:38.760" style="s2">Steven Weber at the time of writing this</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.120" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">was a political economy professor and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.760" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">researcher at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">California in Berkeley and what he did</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">that I really loved was he looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">the way that economic theories presume</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">that open source software could never be</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:55.470" style="s2">created and then what was wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:57.710" style="s2">those theories as demonstrated by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.470" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">actual success of open-source software</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.710" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">so when I read this book I had an</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">epiphany on the first page about how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">solve the climate crisis so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">book that really has some potential for</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">deep and cathartic insights the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">for me that really stood out that helped</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:16.950" style="s2">me have an understanding about dealing</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">with climate change was a shift in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.950" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">way that certain legal definitions are</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">used so as a technical point open source</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">software is built on a number of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:29.070" style="s2">different licensing agreements and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:31.140" style="s2">licensing agreements grow out of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.070" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">world of what is called intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">property rights which at a deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">is about the way that we legally</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">recognized ownership who owns what and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">how and so the thing that Steven Weber</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">pointed out on page 1 of this book was</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">that part of the collection of Rights</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">that an owner has is the right to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">exclude others so if I own a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">property then I can put a fence around</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">it and exclude other people from coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">onto my property well in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">that I can exclude people from using</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:02.900" style="s2">something I can create a definition for</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:05.720" style="s2">why and how people can or cannot use</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.900" end="00:02:07.220" style="s2">so what he showed that was really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.720" end="00:02:09.530" style="s2">powerful for me was that open source</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.220" end="00:02:12.410" style="s2">software took this right to exclude and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.530" end="00:02:15.410" style="s2">flipped it on its head by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.410" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">for certain kinds of legal arrangements</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.410" end="00:02:19.970" style="s2">this is where the Creative Commons</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:22.250" style="s2">copyright laws come from for certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.970" end="00:02:24.680" style="s2">legal arrangements it is possible to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.250" end="00:02:26.930" style="s2">that if I can exclude anyone from using</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.680" end="00:02:29.390" style="s2">this and I will exclude anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.930" end="00:02:32.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to share so I will exclude</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.390" end="00:02:35.810" style="s2">those who would exclude and when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.390" end="00:02:38.570" style="s2">take this really powerful bit of legal</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.810" end="00:02:39.890" style="s2">jujitsu to its extreme that you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.570" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">things like the birth of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.890" end="00:02:45.350" style="s2">sharing economy and so what Steven Weber</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:48.470" style="s2">does in this book the success of open</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.350" end="00:02:50.750" style="s2">source as he explains how the economic</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.470" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">transactions work at the level of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.750" end="00:02:53.900" style="s2">society so what happens when people come</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.880" end="00:02:56.360" style="s2">together and try to create something</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.900" end="00:02:59.090" style="s2">really big where ownership is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.360" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">distributed so Wikipedia is an example</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.090" end="00:03:04.190" style="s2">the world owns Wikipedia as an</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">intellectual commons and it is created</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.190" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">by people contributing to it while</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:10.370" style="s2">feeling like no one else is ever going</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:12.440" style="s2">to be able to exclude them or others</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.370" end="00:03:15.140" style="s2">from being able to use the material they</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.440" end="00:03:17.720" style="s2">created together and so the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.140" end="00:03:20.420" style="s2">legal rights of Wikipedia are set up are</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.720" end="00:03:22.580" style="s2">inspired by the legal arrangements for</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.420" end="00:03:24.620" style="s2">open source software so in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.580" end="00:03:27.050" style="s2">by changing the way we think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.620" end="00:03:30.500" style="s2">ownership and collective action to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.050" end="00:03:34.220" style="s2">create really complex socially valuable</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.500" end="00:03:37.190" style="s2">things wikipedia open source software or</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.220" end="00:03:41.390" style="s2">the sharing economy we begin to see how</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.190" end="00:03:42.950" style="s2">we can do a very different approach take</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.390" end="00:03:45.290" style="s2">a very different approach to the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:48.500" style="s2">that we create and share things and stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.290" end="00:03:50.360" style="s2">this hoarding behavior that allows 85</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.500" end="00:03:52.820" style="s2">individuals to have more wealth than the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.360" end="00:03:55.400" style="s2">bottom three billion people see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.820" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">happens because those who own things</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.400" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">could exclude others from having access</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:03.019" style="s2">to them but if we set up a system of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.620" end="00:04:05.330" style="s2">legal arrangements where we exclude</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.019" end="00:04:07.489" style="s2">those who would hoard things then we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.330" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">actually bring that hoarding behavior to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.489" end="00:04:10.550" style="s2">an end and that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:12.890" style="s2">that&#39;s explained and rich</p>
