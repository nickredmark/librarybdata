<p begin="00:00:00.230" end="00:00:05.400" style="s2">hi I&#39;m an Eric Weinstein and welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.000" end="00:00:09.139" style="s2">back to my youtube video channel today</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.400" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting here with a special guest</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.139" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">you may know him from my Twitter feed</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:18.510" style="s2">because I introduced him in 2009 under</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">the pseudonym for y ou but he&#39;s now 13</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.510" end="00:00:24.570" style="s2">years old and I wanted the world to meet</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:26.490" style="s2">my sons my site so thanks for coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">thanks for having me so I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.490" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">what we could best discuss but one thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:32.040" style="s2">that&#39;s exciting to me is that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:34.170" style="s2">understood that you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.040" end="00:00:35.070" style="s2">starting a YouTube channel can you tell</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.170" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">me what&#39;s going into that thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.070" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">apprentice</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">well I think one sort of problem with</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">our generations I think is bound to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:48.030" style="s2">very important generation is that at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">current age of most of our members were</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.030" end="00:00:53.430" style="s2">not particularly verbal or expressive</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">and I think that this is an issue and if</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.430" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">maybe some past generations could sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">of get a better understanding of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">the the newcomers I think that could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:08.100" style="s2">very very helpful to the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.100" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">discussed and talked about and I hope to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:16.590" style="s2">sort of have an outlet to share my</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">thoughts and ideas with the world so</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.590" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">that someone is our in our generation is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">being expressive of what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:26.759" style="s2">through so it&#39;s super interesting let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">rip off of that for a second I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.759" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">what I feel is that I&#39;m learning a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">tremendous amount from you because</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">you&#39;re not shy about expressing not only</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:39.509" style="s2">your ideas but conflicts between the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">ideas as you sort of sort of assemble a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.509" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">perspective why do you suppose it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:47.689" style="s2">that there&#39;s so much interest in what</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">people believe after the Millennials</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.689" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">well I think one thing which is being</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">becoming increasingly more and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">obvious is that this is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">unique time period and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">going to be a very very unique</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">generation and I think for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:11.140" style="s2">the world is not stable at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:14.320" style="s2">right I think we&#39;re in sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.140" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">poorly defined revolution may be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.320" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">similar to the late 60s in the sense or</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:22.090" style="s2">you know there&#39;s certain time periods</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:23.320" style="s2">where no one&#39;s quite sure what to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.090" end="00:02:25.810" style="s2">of the world and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.320" end="00:02:28.270" style="s2">definitely what we&#39;re experiencing at</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.810" end="00:02:31.060" style="s2">the moment can I just ask you a question</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.270" end="00:02:33.460" style="s2">with it yeah so as you know these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.060" end="00:02:34.930" style="s2">your developmental years and if I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.460" end="00:02:38.620" style="s2">take what you&#39;re saying about the late</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.930" end="00:02:41.850" style="s2">60s it&#39;s probably the case that if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.620" end="00:02:44.920" style="s2">were growing up and you were 13 in 1968</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.850" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">your brain was learning about a set of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.920" end="00:02:50.530" style="s2">circumstances that really were very</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:54.370" style="s2">temporary and impertinent and permanent</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.530" end="00:02:56.950" style="s2">do you feel that in some ways this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.370" end="00:03:00.550" style="s2">disadvantageous type to be growing up</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.950" end="00:03:03.010" style="s2">because so much appears to be highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.550" end="00:03:04.870" style="s2">unstable or do you instead have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:08.230" style="s2">of being energized by the instability</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.870" end="00:03:11.290" style="s2">well I think sort of my more general</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.230" end="00:03:14.709" style="s2">take right is it&#39;s nearly impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.290" end="00:03:16.810" style="s2">predict any of this because you know if</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.709" end="00:03:18.730" style="s2">you think for example about technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.810" end="00:03:21.130" style="s2">and how rapidly it&#39;s evolving there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.730" end="00:03:22.750" style="s2">absolutely no way to predict it and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.130" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">predict what the future is going to look</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.750" end="00:03:30.549" style="s2">like and that&#39;s something which does</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:32.980" style="s2">seem to be sort of a definitional part</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.549" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">of this generation and this time period</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.980" end="00:03:37.299" style="s2">and I think as a result of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:40.060" style="s2">very hard to predict sort of how the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.299" end="00:03:42.340" style="s2">figures of our generation will will turn</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.060" end="00:03:45.400" style="s2">out and how some of this stuff could</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.340" end="00:03:47.380" style="s2">benefit us or become a disadvantage and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.400" end="00:03:49.450" style="s2">I think there&#39;s just sort of a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.380" end="00:03:51.640" style="s2">understanding you know on the on the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.450" end="00:03:53.500" style="s2">hand we&#39;re growing up with access to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.640" end="00:03:56.200" style="s2">lot of stuff and I think a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.500" end="00:03:58.420" style="s2">are changing for the better but I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.200" end="00:04:00.040" style="s2">the world is very very divided at least</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.420" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">in America at the moment what are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:05.890" style="s2">seeing as being the major fault lines in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:08.260" style="s2">that division well I think to a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.890" end="00:04:10.090" style="s2">large extent the right has gotten a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.260" end="00:04:12.010" style="s2">crazier and the left has gotten a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.090" end="00:04:14.230" style="s2">crazier and everyone&#39;s being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.010" end="00:04:17.109" style="s2">pick a side so this is something which</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.230" end="00:04:19.989" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty unhappy about and I get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.109" end="00:04:21.760" style="s2">sense that you are too and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.989" end="00:04:23.980" style="s2">think either side really knows what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.760" end="00:04:26.770" style="s2">doing and we&#39;re being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.980" end="00:04:30.010" style="s2">to pick one and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.770" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">really dividing us at the moment you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.010" end="00:04:36.970" style="s2">know I think for example you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:39.850" style="s2">of people are getting categorized and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.970" end="00:04:42.550" style="s2">associated with alright as sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.850" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">boogeyman and you see sort of parallels</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.550" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">of this where people will be associated</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:51.610" style="s2">with very far left figures and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:53.770" style="s2">have a lot more experience with with one</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.610" end="00:04:55.870" style="s2">side of this given that I&#39;ve grown up in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:04:58.630" style="s2">in California in New York which are</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.870" end="00:05:01.270" style="s2">maybe some of the the two most</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.630" end="00:05:04.060" style="s2">democratic states in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.270" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">so I think you know I only have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.060" end="00:05:09.970" style="s2">have one set of experiences but I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not hard to understand what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.970" end="00:05:15.340" style="s2">might be like on that on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:17.620" style="s2">yeah I mean one of my concerns of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.340" end="00:05:19.150" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve never had a situation like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.620" end="00:05:22.860" style="s2">the Trump administration in so many</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.150" end="00:05:25.450" style="s2">different ways and that if this is what</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.860" end="00:05:29.380" style="s2">you think of as one of your earlier</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.450" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">earliest conscious political experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.380" end="00:05:33.960" style="s2">I do wonder what the kind of permanent</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:38.230" style="s2">effect is I don&#39;t think a lot of adults</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.960" end="00:05:41.140" style="s2">thought about what it would be like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.230" end="00:05:43.410" style="s2">have a world in which we don&#39;t even seem</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.140" end="00:05:45.610" style="s2">to agree whether the president was</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.410" end="00:05:48.790" style="s2">democratically elected because of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.610" end="00:05:52.660" style="s2">allegations of Russian vote tampering</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.790" end="00:05:54.730" style="s2">whether people view various behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.660" end="00:05:56.860" style="s2">but the president is so unbecoming as to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.730" end="00:05:59.230" style="s2">make him unfit for office or whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.860" end="00:06:02.620" style="s2">other people see him is the only person</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.230" end="00:06:06.100" style="s2">capable of running the gauntlet and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.620" end="00:06:09.100" style="s2">standing up for reasonable national</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.100" end="00:06:12.120" style="s2">interests that have been demonized as if</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.100" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">they were jingoistic out-of-control</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.120" end="00:06:17.110" style="s2">ultra-nationalism so that&#39;s a very I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:20.770" style="s2">mean even for me that&#39;s pretty confusing</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.110" end="00:06:24.010" style="s2">Mike one of my questions would be does</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:26.890" style="s2">your study of the past give you more</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.010" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">perspective on this Wow</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.890" end="00:06:34.390" style="s2">I think to an extent but it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">hard to try to compare and match our</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.390" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">generation to anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:42.030" style="s2">you know previous I think you know one</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:45.000" style="s2">thing one example I gave which was late</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.030" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">60s which I think is similar but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.000" end="00:06:50.940" style="s2">of the ways in which the world changed</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:53.070" style="s2">were sort of dissimilar so I remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.940" end="00:06:56.790" style="s2">you know when I was younger I&#39;ve the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.070" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">memory of mom telling me you know I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.790" end="00:07:00.780" style="s2">happy you weren&#39;t growing up when when</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.310" end="00:07:02.480" style="s2">some of the really nasty stuff was</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.780" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">coming out about Bill Clinton I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.480" end="00:07:07.560" style="s2">absolutely no idea you know how I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:10.590" style="s2">have dealt with with news and parenting</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.560" end="00:07:12.990" style="s2">a child you know during that presidency</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.590" end="00:07:15.150" style="s2">and I sort of accepted it and then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.990" end="00:07:17.580" style="s2">know a few years later here we are and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.150" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know one thing I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.580" end="00:07:21.630" style="s2">old enough to sort of try to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">of this as well as you know anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.630" end="00:07:26.790" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:29.310" style="s2">difficult and I think one of the really</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.790" end="00:07:33.090" style="s2">positive things which is eventually</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.310" end="00:07:35.000" style="s2">going to be seen more positively even</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.090" end="00:07:38.310" style="s2">though it&#39;s causing maybe a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.000" end="00:07:40.770" style="s2">distress at the moment is that with</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.310" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">however crazy things are at least people</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.770" end="00:07:45.740" style="s2">are talking about the issues it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:48.960" style="s2">which we&#39;re sort of you know hidden</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.740" end="00:07:50.910" style="s2">until recent years and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">that will be an advantage for our</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.910" end="00:07:56.850" style="s2">generation because there&#39;s nothing too</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:07:58.260" style="s2">taboo or far-fetched to be discussed and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.850" end="00:08:01.229" style="s2">I think we&#39;re going to get sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.260" end="00:08:03.030" style="s2">very complex understanding of the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.229" end="00:08:05.640" style="s2">and a lot is going to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.030" end="00:08:06.930" style="s2">uncovered for us so I think that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.640" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2">of one of the famines that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.930" end="00:08:13.020" style="s2">received growing up in this really</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:16.710" style="s2">really confusing era so that at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.020" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">things are under discussion right do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.710" end="00:08:22.860" style="s2">have any sense of whether you&#39;re turning</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">to the past or to the present for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.860" end="00:08:29.040" style="s2">thinker&#39;s that mean the most you were</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:31.590" style="s2">some of the some of the voices in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.040" end="00:08:34.440" style="s2">political sphere that matter the most to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.590" end="00:08:36.570" style="s2">you well I think because I&#39;ve grown up</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.440" end="00:08:39.930" style="s2">in a household with you and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:41.969" style="s2">a very very sort of strong presence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.930" end="00:08:44.219" style="s2">my understanding of the world I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.969" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">think my views are exactly the same as</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.219" end="00:08:47.880" style="s2">as yours I know there are places we</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:48.329" style="s2">disagree but I thank you and your</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.880" end="00:08:51.709" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.329" end="00:08:54.929" style="s2">have have played sort of in a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.709" end="00:08:59.309" style="s2">impactful role and in how I viewed the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.929" end="00:09:01.829" style="s2">world and I think sort of the same for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.309" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">Mom and I think I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.829" end="00:09:06.989" style="s2">think anyone&#39;s politics and our family</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">is exactly the same so it&#39;s good because</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.989" end="00:09:10.499" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten that sort of a spectrum even</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:12.239" style="s2">in my own home</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.499" end="00:09:14.429" style="s2">well I think that your mom you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.239" end="00:09:17.399" style="s2">referring to Pia Milani at the Institute</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.429" end="00:09:22.199" style="s2">for new economic thinking is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.399" end="00:09:24.629" style="s2">most sophisticated voices that really is</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.199" end="00:09:28.439" style="s2">connected to I would say the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.629" end="00:09:33.649" style="s2">responsible version of the analytic left</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.439" end="00:09:37.379" style="s2">from yesteryear and I think that where I</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.649" end="00:09:40.889" style="s2">how do you see where I contribute</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.379" end="00:09:43.670" style="s2">differently Wow I think she is as you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.889" end="00:09:49.290" style="s2">would sort of if you sort of seated a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.670" end="00:09:51.089" style="s2">very traditional leftist right and I see</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.290" end="00:09:53.970" style="s2">you as sort of being a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.089" end="00:09:59.269" style="s2">of a renegade and you&#39;re trying to pick</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.970" end="00:10:02.100" style="s2">your own path right and I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.269" end="00:10:04.499" style="s2">my mother has played a lot of stability</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.100" end="00:10:07.939" style="s2">and some of my political views but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.499" end="00:10:10.949" style="s2">think their views which I&#39;m I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.939" end="00:10:11.459" style="s2">choosing not to hold many of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.949" end="00:10:13.589" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.459" end="00:10:17.429" style="s2">because I feel like some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.589" end="00:10:18.869" style="s2">that hold them now have gone so well</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.429" end="00:10:20.939" style="s2">this is across the line</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.869" end="00:10:23.489" style="s2">this is this this is this frustration</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.939" end="00:10:25.860" style="s2">that both you and I have that you want</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.489" end="00:10:28.980" style="s2">to sign up for something that seems 80%</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.860" end="00:10:31.589" style="s2">reasonable but that there&#39;s 20 percent I</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.980" end="00:10:34.350" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call it 8020 what would you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.589" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">call it now I don&#39;t know I think making</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.350" end="00:10:40.799" style="s2">up statistics is always hard I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:43.350" style="s2">give you numbers but I really feel like</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.799" end="00:10:45.959" style="s2">the world has done a lot crazier than</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.350" end="00:10:48.509" style="s2">that and I think you know especially</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.959" end="00:10:51.809" style="s2">with a lot of the people I&#39;ve grown up</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.509" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">with as as part of my generation and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.809" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">where I&#39;ve grown up with it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:59.579" style="s2">far in one direction yeah that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:01.610" style="s2">hard to try to have nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.579" end="00:11:03.940" style="s2">conversations with people</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.610" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">and and I and I think that&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.940" end="00:11:08.269" style="s2">that&#39;s been really difficult you know on</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:10.490" style="s2">one hand a lot of people are talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.269" end="00:11:13.610" style="s2">about a lot of things but then within</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.490" end="00:11:16.940" style="s2">sort of a network and an environment</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.610" end="00:11:20.180" style="s2">there&#39;s just there&#39;s no room for for</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.940" end="00:11:22.220" style="s2">discussion between the two teams and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.180" end="00:11:24.529" style="s2">think that that&#39;s been really hard</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.220" end="00:11:26.329" style="s2">because everything is so polish so this</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.529" end="00:11:29.540" style="s2">is really interesting so in essence</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.329" end="00:11:33.470" style="s2">rather than left versus right you would</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.540" end="00:11:35.180" style="s2">prefer a nuanced group in a none turn on</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.470" end="00:11:36.910" style="s2">nuanced group and you would feel I</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.180" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">assume that you see yourself as being</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.910" end="00:11:42.230" style="s2">more to the left than the writers that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:44.870" style="s2">presumptuous probably and once again I</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.230" end="00:11:47.390" style="s2">think a lot of these things are still</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.870" end="00:11:50.390" style="s2">very flexible in me so I&#39;m trying not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.390" end="00:11:52.610" style="s2">call myself either left or right but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.390" end="00:11:55.940" style="s2">don&#39;t mind looking at it on a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.610" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">what look I tried for a while enough to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.940" end="00:12:02.540" style="s2">use the spectrum but the language just</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:04.220" style="s2">became almost a necessity given that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.540" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">have two parties and people get very</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.220" end="00:12:08.839" style="s2">confined I think that&#39;s unintentional I</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:11.870" style="s2">think in many ways the media is trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.839" end="00:12:13.370" style="s2">to starve us for a vocabulary which will</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.870" end="00:12:15.410" style="s2">really allow us to talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.370" end="00:12:17.060" style="s2">things in an attempt for different</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.410" end="00:12:17.630" style="s2">outlets to sort of preserve their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.060" end="00:12:21.170" style="s2">rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.630" end="00:12:23.420" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.170" end="00:12:29.269" style="s2">that there&#39;s no real language to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.420" end="00:12:33.290" style="s2">sort of a center of the spectrum so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.269" end="00:12:35.709" style="s2">can we hope for in terms of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.290" end="00:12:39.470" style="s2">color that everybody&#39;s looking for on</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.709" end="00:12:42.709" style="s2">what might be termed Generation Z you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.470" end="00:12:44.899" style="s2">need you mean my EQ panel or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.709" end="00:12:47.540" style="s2">generation that follows Gen Y the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.899" end="00:12:49.910" style="s2">followed Gen X yeah yeah so to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.540" end="00:12:52.370" style="s2">or thinking of starting a YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.910" end="00:12:54.199" style="s2">channel title of generations a one</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.370" end="00:12:56.630" style="s2">because my name is Zev and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.199" end="00:12:58.760" style="s2">that that was that was really a hook but</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.630" end="00:13:00.260" style="s2">also because that&#39;s probably one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.760" end="00:13:03.949" style="s2">things I&#39;ll be discussing which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.260" end="00:13:06.860" style="s2">Generation Z as its titled which is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.949" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">followed the Millennials so you know I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.860" end="00:13:10.250" style="s2">like to try to get that out there I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:12.310" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to plug too much on your on</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.250" end="00:13:16.280" style="s2">your video show but</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.310" end="00:13:19.280" style="s2">subscribe now to generation Z yeah are</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.280" end="00:13:20.660" style="s2">you doing that button active won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.280" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">the first time you&#39;ve manipulated be</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.660" end="00:13:25.730" style="s2">effectively now do you have any closing</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:27.770" style="s2">thoughts about what is like to follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.730" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">the Millennials and what you see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.770" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">principle differences between</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">generations and the Millennials as being</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:39.470" style="s2">well I mean I think it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:41.660" style="s2">unclear still but you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.470" end="00:13:43.550" style="s2">Millennials are holding increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.660" end="00:13:45.080" style="s2">more power over the world because</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.550" end="00:13:47.840" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of the closest to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.080" end="00:13:49.850" style="s2">understanding our generation so if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.840" end="00:13:52.580" style="s2">look at you know the people that create</p>
