<p begin="00:00:01.190" end="00:00:05.850" style="s2">hi Michael thanks so much for making</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.689" end="00:00:07.109" style="s2">time for this conversation and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.850" end="00:00:10.050" style="s2">actually had a couple of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.109" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">recently that we got so carried away</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.050" end="00:00:15.389" style="s2">with that we didn&#39;t really hit the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">record button but I just would love to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:20.820" style="s2">start as I usually do in this series</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">with rather than me introducing you I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.820" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">got I&#39;ve mentioned your work in my book</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:28.500" style="s2">and I have been excited by by your work</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">ever since I first found out about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.500" end="00:00:39.210" style="s2">and and see you as one of the real</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:42.860" style="s2">pioneers of trying to include biomimetic</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.210" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">thinking but also at the system&#39;s level</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.860" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">how do we learn from ecosystems into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">projects you work with in your</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">architectural firm so um over to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">with how did you get to do the work</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">you&#39;re doing today and tell me a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">bit about you your story yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">thanks very much for involving me in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">this Daniel it&#39;s always a pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:07.159" style="s2">talking to you so you know in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">it goes back to when I was a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.159" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">how passionate about three things design</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:14.790" style="s2">biology in the environment and at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:17.189" style="s2">stage I couldn&#39;t see how those things</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">fit together I thought about studying</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.189" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">biology it&#39;s university but I didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">there was a creative side to it so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">left that behind studied architecture</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">and then it was really when I joined</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">Grimshaw age 32 work on the Eden Project</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">from the early stages that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">realized that there was a way to bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">together those three strands of design</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">biology in the environment and then my</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">understanding of the subject moved on in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">a really transformative way when I went</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">on a five-day course at Schumaker</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">college and that was led by Janine</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">Benyus and Amory Lovins and I learned</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">more in those five days than the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">previous ten years of going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">conferences and listening to architects</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">talk about her level and so I I led a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">lot of the projects that were pushing</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">pushing sustainable and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:14.040" style="s2">ideas Grimshaw</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:16.860" style="s2">and I came to conclusion that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.040" end="00:02:19.950" style="s2">to set up my own company so that I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.860" end="00:02:21.900" style="s2">focus exclusively on this area and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:25.890" style="s2">also try a new way of working as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.900" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">architect I had a feeling that you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.890" end="00:02:30.600" style="s2">architects tend to be rather reactive</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">you generally as an architect you wait</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.600" end="00:02:34.170" style="s2">for a client to come along sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">get a very good one as we did on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.170" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">Eaton project but more often than not</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">you get a client that says they want a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:43.019" style="s2">sustainable building but then often</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">they&#39;ve already chosen the sites which</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.019" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">is not ideal sometimes they&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:49.739" style="s2">got a team that&#39;s not ideal and and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:53.069" style="s2">from that point on you&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.739" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">make the best out of a compromise and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.069" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">felt there an opportunity for a new way</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">of working there was a bit more like say</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">where product designer works where you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">have an idealized notion of what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">project is you develop it up to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">certain point and then when you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">what he did what it is and what it can</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">do back into wish you find the client</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:14.190" style="s2">and by doing that my hope was that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">could overcome some of the obstacles to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.190" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">to faster progress and there were a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:22.500" style="s2">number of projects we did like when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">say we I&#39;m talking about my company</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.500" end="00:03:26.220" style="s2">exploration so it&#39;s me and quite a range</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:28.980" style="s2">of colleagues and it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.220" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">collaborative process I really enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.980" end="00:03:37.609" style="s2">working with a Polymathic team so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:37.609" style="s2">not from the school of thought that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.120" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">has this of Architects is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">iconic super designer and the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2">the team is just there to realize the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:49.410" style="s2">beautiful vision it&#39;s not like that at</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.850" end="00:03:51.810" style="s2">all I actually see the role of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.410" end="00:03:54.690" style="s2">architect much more like Benjamin Zander</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.810" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">talks about the role of a conductor he</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.690" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">says that the conductor doesn&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">sound but relies instead for his or her</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:05.480" style="s2">power on making other people powerful</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:09.739" style="s2">and unifying that into a cohesive result</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.480" end="00:04:12.590" style="s2">and so we found we&#39;ve worked on a number</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.739" end="00:04:15.020" style="s2">of projects similar to the process I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.590" end="00:04:17.209" style="s2">described where we initiated them at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.020" end="00:04:19.940" style="s2">Sahara forest projects is one such</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.209" end="00:04:21.950" style="s2">example and back to that and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.940" end="00:04:23.930" style="s2">also worked on projects where we do have</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.950" end="00:04:26.440" style="s2">a client from the beginning and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.930" end="00:04:29.450" style="s2">generally that&#39;s been a client that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.440" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">wants to really go beyond conventional</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.450" end="00:04:34.970" style="s2">sustainability when I said that what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:37.580" style="s2">mean is going beyond simply mitigating</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.970" end="00:04:40.550" style="s2">negatives we&#39;ve just seen way too much</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.580" end="00:04:42.500" style="s2">of that and in a way we&#39;ve had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.550" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">30 years of mitigating negatives and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:48.770" style="s2">that it hasn&#39;t got us anywhere near to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:51.200" style="s2">where we really need to get you so for</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.770" end="00:04:53.450" style="s2">instance we did design for an office</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.200" end="00:04:57.260" style="s2">building with a client called dr. Ralph</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.450" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2">Bell and either a very high-performing</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.260" end="00:05:01.580" style="s2">sustainable building and became more and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:05.450" style="s2">more interest in the idea of using</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.580" end="00:05:07.070" style="s2">biomimicry to go one step further or all</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.450" end="00:05:09.080" style="s2">the different aspects of the projects</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.070" end="00:05:13.190" style="s2">and we showed how we could achieve a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.080" end="00:05:15.410" style="s2">huge saving in physical resources huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.190" end="00:05:17.720" style="s2">saving in energy as well as making it a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.410" end="00:05:19.780" style="s2">much better working around for people in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.720" end="00:05:22.669" style="s2">terms of their health and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.780" end="00:05:24.820" style="s2">briefly because what I find</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.669" end="00:05:29.090" style="s2">distinguishes you from a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.820" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">biomimetic architects is that um when</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.090" end="00:05:33.140" style="s2">you when you kind of take the the rule</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:35.210" style="s2">book of biomimicry there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.140" end="00:05:39.169" style="s2">there&#39;s three levels of mimicry you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.210" end="00:05:41.810" style="s2">mimic form process or you do ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.169" end="00:05:44.419" style="s2">level biomimicry and I feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.810" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">you&#39;re one of the few who really works</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.419" end="00:05:53.169" style="s2">on but with biomimicry much more in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.770" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">terms of patterns of flow and energy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.169" end="00:05:57.560" style="s2">regulating climate like so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:00.940" style="s2">project from the Eden Project and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.560" end="00:06:05.030" style="s2">Sahara forest project aren&#39;t just about</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.940" end="00:06:07.160" style="s2">creating a beautiful structure that has</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.030" end="00:06:10.669" style="s2">a biomimetic form but they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.160" end="00:06:13.550" style="s2">about increasing the potential in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.669" end="00:06:16.039" style="s2">place to do things that otherwise that</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.550" end="00:06:19.249" style="s2">place might might not be the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.039" end="00:06:23.479" style="s2">location for like regulating climate and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.249" end="00:06:27.649" style="s2">one&#39;s for EM homed in on that a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.479" end="00:06:30.759" style="s2">bit with it I really like the way you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.649" end="00:06:34.399" style="s2">describe it in your book how on earth is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.759" end="00:06:37.909" style="s2">an amazingly complex arrangement of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.399" end="00:06:41.389" style="s2">nested systems there&#39;s systems of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.909" end="00:06:44.929" style="s2">cellular level we are a system as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.389" end="00:06:46.699" style="s2">organism and as we now know only 10% of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.929" end="00:06:49.609" style="s2">our cells or human cells the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.699" end="00:06:53.029" style="s2">microbial and we have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.609" end="00:06:56.839" style="s2">with a broader ecosystem and that exists</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.029" end="00:06:59.389" style="s2">at local levels regional levels and all</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.009" end="00:07:46.949" style="s2">look at the potential of the place</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:15.180" style="s2">is and how that forms an essential</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.310" end="00:08:56.310" style="s2">ecosystem very much alignment yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.750" end="00:08:59.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve used that kind of thinking on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.310" end="00:09:01.290" style="s2">number of projects more risk than one</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.670" end="00:09:03.029" style="s2">than the Sarah Forest project is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.290" end="00:09:05.850" style="s2">scheme we designed for client in India</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.029" end="00:09:09.089" style="s2">for a zero-waste zero-carbon textile</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.850" end="00:09:11.790" style="s2">factory and that was really challenging</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.089" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">because textiles as an industry uses</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.790" end="00:09:17.180" style="s2">huge quantities of energy with turn and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">also those tend not to be particularly</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.180" end="00:09:22.019" style="s2">enjoyable working environments and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:23.339" style="s2">working with this behind we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.019" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">show that we could get all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.339" end="00:09:28.890" style="s2">zero carbon and close loop on water zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:32.070" style="s2">solid waste and grace to fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.890" end="00:09:35.370" style="s2">working environment for people and one</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.070" end="00:09:37.649" style="s2">very important part of that was using</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:40.890" style="s2">forms of biological remediation for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.649" end="00:09:43.230" style="s2">water so we had a water expert and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.890" end="00:09:46.980" style="s2">green chemist involved and by designing</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.230" end="00:09:48.990" style="s2">out all the toxic chemicals to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.980" end="00:09:51.329" style="s2">system it then made it much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.990" end="00:09:52.590" style="s2">feasible to use biological forms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.329" end="00:09:55.620" style="s2">treatment for that water</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.590" end="00:09:57.690" style="s2">and very deliberately we put these these</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.620" end="00:10:00.450" style="s2">biological treatment ponds all the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.690" end="00:10:02.850" style="s2">and down the middle of the factory there</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.450" end="00:10:05.460" style="s2">were two - you pass the factory and down</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.850" end="00:10:07.860" style="s2">the middle they would police have read</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.460" end="00:10:09.960" style="s2">bad water treatment systems so we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.860" end="00:10:13.020" style="s2">actually getting a secondary benefit</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.960" end="00:10:14.790" style="s2">because we had big picture windows all</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.020" end="00:10:16.680" style="s2">the way down and that meant that from</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.790" end="00:10:19.320" style="s2">any part of the factory people look out</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.680" end="00:10:22.080" style="s2">and get a view of nature with all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.320" end="00:10:27.090" style="s2">psychological benefits that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.080" end="00:10:29.340" style="s2">Gibbs as well as in sorry just reminded</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.090" end="00:10:31.980" style="s2">me have you come across the work of an</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.340" end="00:10:33.870" style="s2">architect Chris Galvin and we used to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.980" end="00:10:39.030" style="s2">work for therapy and terraces bright</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.870" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">green there&#39;s because he I think was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.030" end="00:10:44.700" style="s2">lead on when they wrote a report on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:47.340" style="s2">economics of Biophilia and ensured how</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.700" end="00:10:49.710" style="s2">what you just described for the factory</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.340" end="00:10:52.950" style="s2">they were mainly looking at hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.710" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">how you can actually get a financial</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.950" end="00:10:56.790" style="s2">benefit in terms of how people work how</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:59.940" style="s2">quickly their Hospital turns over and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.790" end="00:11:05.070" style="s2">heals people if there&#39;s a lot of direct</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.940" end="00:11:07.110" style="s2">visual access to life yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.070" end="00:11:09.150" style="s2">classic study I think it was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.110" end="00:11:11.580" style="s2">hospital in Pittsburgh and there was one</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.150" end="00:11:13.530" style="s2">award where all of patients were</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.580" end="00:11:15.990" style="s2">recovering from the same operation so it</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.530" end="00:11:21.990" style="s2">was a perfect controlled experiment off</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.990" end="00:11:25.170" style="s2">the beds had a view across our roads to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.990" end="00:11:28.140" style="s2">a blank wall and the other half had a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.170" end="00:11:31.110" style="s2">view to a plant each courtyard with nice</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.140" end="00:11:32.820" style="s2">vegetation and so on and the people with</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.110" end="00:11:35.340" style="s2">the view of nature recovered eight</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.820" end="00:11:37.410" style="s2">percent more quickly and and the really</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.340" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">dramatic difference was how much less</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.410" end="00:11:42.950" style="s2">they needed in terms of pain-relieving</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:45.960" style="s2">drugs fifty percent less family and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.950" end="00:11:48.360" style="s2">quite apart from the amazing human</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.960" end="00:11:51.080" style="s2">benefits of that approach I think think</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.360" end="00:11:54.709" style="s2">of the economic benefits of treating one</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.080" end="00:11:56.269" style="s2">8% more quickly yeah that ought to by</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.709" end="00:11:59.930" style="s2">now be standard practice for all</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.269" end="00:12:02.149" style="s2">hospitals and yeah it&#39;s a continuing</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.930" end="00:12:04.810" style="s2">frustration for me and I&#39;m guessing for</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.149" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">you as well what&#39;s some of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.810" end="00:12:11.450" style="s2">benefits is so obvious and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:13.940" style="s2">stuck in a very very sort of slow slowly</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.450" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">evolving economic paradigm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.940" end="00:12:20.149" style="s2">reluctant to see at the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:23.089" style="s2">because I&#39;m sure maybe nobody has done</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.149" end="00:12:25.750" style="s2">that kind of research yet but in a if</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.089" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">you have to go and work in a factory</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.750" end="00:12:31.490" style="s2">assembly line environment if it feels a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.100" style="s2">bit more like a forest and a little less</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.490" end="00:12:37.010" style="s2">like an inhumane machine that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.100" end="00:12:39.290" style="s2">just been plugged into and I&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.010" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">a people will go there with a different</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.290" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">motivation probably work differently but</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:46.310" style="s2">also most likely have less sick days and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">and and actually be more efficient so it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.310" end="00:12:51.589" style="s2">very often once you dare to think more</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:53.930" style="s2">holistically about these things then</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.589" end="00:12:56.630" style="s2">there are health and economic benefits</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.930" end="00:13:03.589" style="s2">that previously weren&#39;t figured into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.630" end="00:13:07.399" style="s2">economics of it yeah absolutely so in</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.589" end="00:13:09.670" style="s2">terms of the the Eden Project like what</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.399" end="00:13:15.640" style="s2">is your thought on because right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.670" end="00:13:20.329" style="s2">this post covered 19 a lot of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.640" end="00:13:23.060" style="s2">maybe we should have in our move towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.329" end="00:13:26.570" style="s2">globalizing and creating a globalised</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.060" end="00:13:29.089" style="s2">supply system paid more attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.570" end="00:13:32.510" style="s2">fact that certain things are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.089" end="00:13:35.149" style="s2">sensible to be able to supply to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.510" end="00:13:38.209" style="s2">population at a more regional or local</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.149" end="00:13:40.130" style="s2">level because you never know when there</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.209" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">might be a disruption to supply lines</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.130" end="00:13:44.449" style="s2">and and so there&#39;s a lot more talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:48.709" style="s2">food sovereignty a lot more people going</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.449" end="00:13:53.589" style="s2">back to growing food and and this these</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.709" end="00:13:56.560" style="s2">technologies that enable that use either</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.589" end="00:14:00.470" style="s2">artificial shells like the domes or</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.560" end="00:14:02.839" style="s2">thermo flywheels with with water hot</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.470" end="00:14:03.830" style="s2">water cool water storage that regulates</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.140" end="00:14:12.500" style="s2">these these artificial and slightly</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.990" end="00:14:17.660" style="s2">artificial environments but but using</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.500" end="00:14:21.130" style="s2">good physics and and not a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.660" end="00:14:23.480" style="s2">to create the enabling conditions for</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.160" end="00:14:36.290" style="s2">far the potential that we could achieve</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.620" end="00:14:39.470" style="s2">in the future and you think though if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.290" end="00:14:41.930" style="s2">want to create a climate resilient world</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.470" end="00:14:44.690" style="s2">where communities have food sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.930" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">is might play a much bigger role in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.690" end="00:14:53.870" style="s2">future a lot of strands to that question</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.120" end="00:14:55.190" style="s2">I mean in some ways the most of one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.870" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">the most basic definitions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.190" end="00:15:02.150" style="s2">architecture is about modifying the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">climates to create a more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.150" end="00:15:08.210" style="s2">conducive internal environments and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">there are some actually very good</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.210" end="00:15:12.140" style="s2">examples of how that happens in biology</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:14.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a plant called the Himalayan</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.140" end="00:15:16.460" style="s2">rhubarb lives in there Himalayas and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.750" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit like an artificial greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.460" end="00:15:23.560" style="s2">it has these semi-transparent leaves and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:27.620" style="s2">it creates warmer conditions within its</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.560" end="00:15:30.830" style="s2">underneath its leaves that allowed it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.620" end="00:15:32.780" style="s2">become quite dominant and by far the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.830" end="00:15:35.840" style="s2">largest plants in its particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.780" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">ecosystem just just by modifying the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.840" end="00:15:41.510" style="s2">environment and slightly so I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">there&#39;s huge potential for creating</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.510" end="00:15:47.630" style="s2">growing environments that improve our</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.540" end="00:15:49.970" style="s2">food growing capabilities and yes there</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.630" end="00:15:52.370" style="s2">is a very strong case for real</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.970" end="00:15:54.760" style="s2">localizing or region release from</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.370" end="00:15:59.210" style="s2">regionalizing and some of our our food</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.760" end="00:16:02.470" style="s2">supply chains and I&#39;ve met some people</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.210" end="00:16:06.080" style="s2">who had a bridle at the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.470" end="00:16:09.260" style="s2">localizing because it feels somehow</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.080" end="00:16:10.730" style="s2">constraining but I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.260" end="00:16:13.130" style="s2">important to distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.730" end="00:16:14.900" style="s2">different types of resources and the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.130" end="00:16:16.640" style="s2">I put it is that we need to localize our</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.900" end="00:16:19.220" style="s2">physical resources and globalize our</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.640" end="00:16:22.389" style="s2">intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.220" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s all about becoming</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.389" end="00:16:28.970" style="s2">parochial is it&#39;s just sanity you know</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.970" end="00:16:35.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve got and show how we can do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.459" end="00:16:42.050" style="s2">with huge improvements in the efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.660" end="00:16:44.360" style="s2">of the way we use resources and actually</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:08.369" style="s2">recently I I was advising a national</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.369" end="00:18:14.940" style="s2">they asked me to try and describe you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.769" end="00:18:17.340" style="s2">know why is this important and the way I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.940" end="00:18:20.489" style="s2">presented to to them was well let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.340" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">a lettuce just coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.489" end="00:18:27.720" style="s2">supermarket let&#39;s see where that comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:29.489" style="s2">from and the NPK nitrogen phosphorus and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.720" end="00:18:31.529" style="s2">potassium fertilizer that will have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.489" end="00:18:33.239" style="s2">used to grow it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.529" end="00:18:35.309" style="s2">well the phosphorus would have probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.239" end="00:18:37.859" style="s2">come from Morocco the nitrogen would</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.309" end="00:18:41.070" style="s2">probably come from Qatar Joseon would</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.859" end="00:18:44.039" style="s2">probably come from China those would</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.070" end="00:18:46.200" style="s2">have all come together to the nearest</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.629" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">but it&#39;d have been air freighted from</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.340" end="00:19:10.169" style="s2">out of landfill space and because of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.389" end="00:19:18.269" style="s2">and if you think of the molecules in</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.690" end="00:19:20.340" style="s2">that lettuce they will traveled thirty</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.269" end="00:19:25.169" style="s2">thousand kilometres and then they would</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.340" end="00:19:27.330" style="s2">end up as ash it&#39;s just an absurd way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.169" end="00:19:30.119" style="s2">doing things and such a long supply</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.330" end="00:19:33.269" style="s2">chain it makes it nearly impossible to</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.309" end="00:19:39.929" style="s2">localize that you could actually close</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.259" end="00:22:33.049" style="s2">Biden Meadows and it reminded me of how</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.480" end="00:22:35.809" style="s2">to bring about change and in that essay</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.049" end="00:22:40.539" style="s2">as you know but for the benefit of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.809" end="00:22:42.740" style="s2">listeners and what she argues is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.539" end="00:22:45.080" style="s2">there are different places to intervene</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.740" end="00:22:48.110" style="s2">in a system and some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.080" end="00:22:49.519" style="s2">we think are often inferential are</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.110" end="00:22:52.190" style="s2">actually well down her list of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.519" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">priorities and right at the top is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.190" end="00:22:58.730" style="s2">changing the paradigm or mindset out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.039" end="00:23:02.710" style="s2">which the system behavior emerges and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.730" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">I decided to do two things I started</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.710" end="00:23:08.899" style="s2">work on a new book with Sarah Akaka</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:11.779" style="s2">provisional title for that is paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.899" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">shifts for planetary emergency and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.779" end="00:23:15.830" style="s2">I met up with an old friend of mine an</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:18.350" style="s2">architect called Steve Tompkins for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.830" end="00:23:20.389" style="s2">rather gloomy drinking the pub to talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.350" end="00:23:23.240" style="s2">about what can we do about this and out</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.389" end="00:23:27.259" style="s2">of that came the idea of getting a group</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.240" end="00:23:29.629" style="s2">of architects together to make a joint</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.259" end="00:23:31.490" style="s2">declaration and as time went on it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.629" end="00:23:34.610" style="s2">became obvious that the thing to do was</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.490" end="00:23:36.700" style="s2">to make that a declaration of climate</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.610" end="00:23:39.110" style="s2">University emergency</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.700" end="00:23:40.879" style="s2">and that was because a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.110" end="00:23:43.369" style="s2">organizations had started doing that so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.879" end="00:23:47.090" style="s2">a lot of local authorities that time</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.369" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">recently declared an emergency so we did</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.090" end="00:23:55.129" style="s2">that and it was fantastic to see how</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:57.409" style="s2">rapidly that was taken up so within the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.129" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">first two days of launching we had 200</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.409" end="00:24:02.029" style="s2">practices in the UK signed up to an 11</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.840" end="00:24:04.639" style="s2">point declaration and those declaration</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.029" end="00:24:06.679" style="s2">points they were also based on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.639" end="00:24:09.499" style="s2">of paradigm shifts so really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.679" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">do something substantially different to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.499" end="00:24:14.179" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been attempting for the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:18.200" style="s2">30 years and we actually just passed the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.179" end="00:24:20.509" style="s2">one-year mock on the 30th of May that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.200" end="00:24:26.450" style="s2">was the one-year mark since we launched</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.509" end="00:24:29.029" style="s2">just past 5,000 companies wide in 22</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.450" end="00:24:33.639" style="s2">different countries so that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.029" end="00:24:37.669" style="s2">really energizing and exciting and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.639" end="00:24:40.070" style="s2">holding in coordination meetings with</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.669" end="00:24:44.570" style="s2">people in like 15 different time zones</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.070" end="00:24:46.549" style="s2">sharing ideas how we can really make a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.570" end="00:24:50.289" style="s2">difference and what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.549" end="00:24:52.879" style="s2">is to use the kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.289" end="00:24:54.860" style="s2">influence and momentum of all these</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.879" end="00:24:58.220" style="s2">signatories to bring about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.860" end="00:24:59.960" style="s2">tipping point that we need to make it</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.220" end="00:25:02.779" style="s2">much easier to implement these things on</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.960" end="00:25:06.289" style="s2">projects I from my own experience that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.779" end="00:25:09.110" style="s2">is really quite tough to try and achieve</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.289" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">the degree of system change and scale of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.110" end="00:25:17.779" style="s2">an individual project and by doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.559" end="00:25:21.139" style="s2">by getting all these people together and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.779" end="00:25:24.710" style="s2">use that collective influence we hope we</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.139" end="00:25:27.409" style="s2">can bring back points here in the UK and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.710" end="00:25:30.019" style="s2">hopefully elsewhere as well how do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.409" end="00:25:31.730" style="s2">see I mean that because all of those</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.019" end="00:25:35.119" style="s2">architects those five dollars and firms</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.730" end="00:25:37.909" style="s2">are caught and many of them I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.119" end="00:25:41.149" style="s2">without wanting to offend them I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.909" end="00:25:43.249" style="s2">as exploration and leading edges your</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.149" end="00:25:45.320" style="s2">company is but they still also try to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.249" end="00:25:47.480" style="s2">push the boundaries and their fields and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.320" end="00:25:49.110" style="s2">they&#39;re still running to exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.480" end="00:25:51.210" style="s2">wall you&#39;ve described of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.110" end="00:25:55.530" style="s2">and wonderful ideas but the market isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.210" end="00:25:57.000" style="s2">quite ready for you for it yet and I get</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.530" end="00:25:59.309" style="s2">the same conversations we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.000" end="00:26:02.250" style="s2">inspired leaders of larger</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.309" end="00:26:05.940" style="s2">multinationals who really want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.250" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">the move into like they turn their</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.940" end="00:26:11.190" style="s2">companies into regenerative companies if</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:14.010" style="s2">they&#39;re privately owned they often have</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.190" end="00:26:15.540" style="s2">quite a lot of leeway to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.010" end="00:26:18.570" style="s2">things but if they&#39;re publicly owned</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.540" end="00:26:21.299" style="s2">they actually very often stuck in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.570" end="00:26:25.410" style="s2">system where the imagine of what they</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.299" end="00:26:30.740" style="s2">can do is limited and so how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.410" end="00:26:32.850" style="s2">a movement such as that actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.740" end="00:26:37.620" style="s2">reaching into transforming the entire</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.850" end="00:26:39.240" style="s2">building sector and and saying that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.620" end="00:26:40.980" style="s2">immediately thinking of people like</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.240" end="00:26:47.340" style="s2">Jason McClendon the living building</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.980" end="00:26:51.570" style="s2">Institute or Jason twill I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.340" end="00:26:53.370" style="s2">have you met him no he is he&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.570" end="00:26:54.870" style="s2">person who worked a lot with the Living</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.370" end="00:26:57.960" style="s2">Building Institute he&#39;s now in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.870" end="00:27:00.090" style="s2">he&#39;s about to move to Dubai and he&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.960" end="00:27:01.950" style="s2">many years been trying to transform not</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.090" end="00:27:04.860" style="s2">as an architect but with the large</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.950" end="00:27:08.250" style="s2">building constructing companies the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.860" end="00:27:10.860" style="s2">field of the built environment and who</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.250" end="00:27:13.140" style="s2">do you see as allies in this systemic</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.860" end="00:27:15.510" style="s2">transformation how do you make that link</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.140" end="00:27:21.150" style="s2">from 5,000 firm saying we really would</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.510" end="00:27:26.070" style="s2">like to do different practice and we we</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.150" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">need to shift the clients mmm there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.070" end="00:27:31.710" style="s2">another question with so many strands to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:33.890" style="s2">it so one of the chapters that Sarah and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:38.520" style="s2">I working on in our book is about</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.890" end="00:27:42.990" style="s2">maximization of agency and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.520" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">be perhaps almost universal as a human</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.990" end="00:27:47.970" style="s2">tendency to to minimize our agency and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:49.410" style="s2">think well I&#39;m only an architect and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.970" end="00:27:51.299" style="s2">there&#39;s only a certain land I can do and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.410" end="00:27:53.400" style="s2">so I certainly see a lot of that even</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.299" end="00:27:56.010" style="s2">amongst really quite senior influential</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.400" end="00:27:58.050" style="s2">architects and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.010" end="00:28:00.180" style="s2">I see the same thing with companies who</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.050" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">say well you know weird answerable to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.180" end="00:28:04.380" style="s2">our shareholders and we have to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:06.900" style="s2">good quickly returns and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.380" end="00:28:08.730" style="s2">there&#39;s not much we can do and then I</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.900" end="00:28:10.710" style="s2">see it from the media as well saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.730" end="00:28:12.510" style="s2">well you know we have to create the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.710" end="00:28:14.820" style="s2">stories or programs that people will</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.510" end="00:28:16.980" style="s2">watch and the advertisers will tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.820" end="00:28:21.500" style="s2">and so on and and so it&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.980" end="00:28:23.580" style="s2">vicious cycle of agency minimization and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.500" end="00:28:25.230" style="s2">the more we do that the more it</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:27.900" style="s2">encourages other people to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.230" end="00:28:30.510" style="s2">their agency but the good news is is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.900" end="00:28:33.540" style="s2">that if you flip that the same is true</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.510" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">if we choose to maximize our agency in</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.540" end="00:28:37.260" style="s2">half can have the same sort of viral</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">effects on others encouraging everyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.260" end="00:28:42.210" style="s2">to to maximize their agency and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:43.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see we need to do now when</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.210" end="00:28:46.740" style="s2">we come up against some kind of obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.680" end="00:28:49.410" style="s2">that&#39;s perhaps slightly higher up in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.740" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">chain of influence it&#39;s not enough to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.410" end="00:28:53.130" style="s2">just say well you know I&#39;ve done as much</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:58.650" style="s2">as I can we need to see how we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.130" end="00:29:01.020" style="s2">overcome that obstacle as an example of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.650" end="00:29:03.540" style="s2">what I mean I gave a talk recently at a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.020" end="00:29:05.160" style="s2">conference about energy disruptors and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.540" end="00:29:08.730" style="s2">there was one of the very senior members</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.160" end="00:29:10.710" style="s2">of shell they&#39;re saying well you know we</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.730" end="00:29:14.190" style="s2">have to compete in a commercial</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.710" end="00:29:16.410" style="s2">environment and I&#39;m pushing I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.190" end="00:29:18.030" style="s2">a chance to speak to Marx but if I had</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.410" end="00:29:21.000" style="s2">done I would have said to him we&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.030" end="00:29:23.700" style="s2">I think things have changed you know you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.000" end="00:29:26.220" style="s2">need to now change the commercial</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.700" end="00:29:29.430" style="s2">environment you could perfectly well get</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.220" end="00:29:32.130" style="s2">together with the four other major oil</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.430" end="00:29:35.510" style="s2">companies and say look if we can run as</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.130" end="00:29:37.890" style="s2">we are our kids will despise us for our</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.510" end="00:29:39.180" style="s2">lack of courage you know because we knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.890" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">what was coming we need to change this</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.180" end="00:29:44.580" style="s2">so if we work together we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:46.560" style="s2">change their commercial environment and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.580" end="00:29:48.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard from some people working in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.560" end="00:29:50.100" style="s2">the oil industry that there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.290" end="00:30:09.570" style="s2">because now so many different</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.570" end="00:30:14.369" style="s2">have declared a climate emergency</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.139" end="00:30:17.129" style="s2">increasingly we&#39;re gonna find projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.369" end="00:30:21.570" style="s2">where the architects the whole design</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.129" end="00:30:24.029" style="s2">team the client organization and the</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.489" end="00:30:30.570" style="s2">emergency and that ought to be an</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.409" end="00:30:33.179" style="s2">opportunity to really raise the level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.570" end="00:30:35.759" style="s2">ambition and all work to see how you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.179" end="00:30:37.830" style="s2">maximize the potential yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.759" end="00:30:43.799" style="s2">Lincoln with engineers declare and all</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.830" end="00:30:47.220" style="s2">the other yes yeah well exactly so on in</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.799" end="00:30:49.529" style="s2">the UK now we have architects structural</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.220" end="00:30:52.109" style="s2">engineers to play civil engineers Claire</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.529" end="00:30:54.929" style="s2">M&amp;E engineers to player project managers</p>

<p begin="00:30:54.929" end="00:31:01.099" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a separate organization</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.669" end="00:31:04.769" style="s2">with I think 22 of the largest</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.099" end="00:31:07.169" style="s2">developers who declare emergency so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.769" end="00:31:10.820" style="s2">definitely part of a growing movement it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.169" end="00:31:14.779" style="s2">reminds me of like last week of speaking</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.820" end="00:31:19.289" style="s2">with people from Borland&#39;s and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.779" end="00:31:22.859" style="s2">touched on how sometimes there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.289" end="00:31:26.429" style="s2">discrepancy between the conversation you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.859" end="00:31:28.289" style="s2">can have with the individuals in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.429" end="00:31:30.659" style="s2">companies if they if you talk to them as</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.289" end="00:31:34.229" style="s2">individuals over the tea break or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.659" end="00:31:36.989" style="s2">lunch and the roles people then play in</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.229" end="00:31:38.909" style="s2">their professional environments and I in</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.989" end="00:31:41.940" style="s2">that conversation I was reminded of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.909" end="00:31:44.700" style="s2">situation that I had with a consultancy</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.940" end="00:31:49.289" style="s2">client where that was really stuck to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.700" end="00:31:52.200" style="s2">were working on a future exhibition of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.289" end="00:31:54.299" style="s2">museum with a lot of bright people in</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.200" end="00:31:59.009" style="s2">the room but the future that they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.299" end="00:32:01.799" style="s2">projecting was a garish kind of sci-fi</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.009" end="00:32:05.729" style="s2">future of everything done by technology</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.799" end="00:32:08.580" style="s2">and then when you had conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.729" end="00:32:10.470" style="s2">them and over the tea break and asked</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.580" end="00:32:12.029" style="s2">them would you want your children to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.470" end="00:32:16.499" style="s2">grow up in that future there were a hell</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.029" end="00:32:18.779" style="s2">no but-but-but-but in their professional</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.499" end="00:32:21.179" style="s2">roles they felt that they were at their</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.779" end="00:32:23.460" style="s2">brightest and most brigands they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.179" end="00:32:25.500" style="s2">working for whatever space Asian</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.460" end="00:32:30.169" style="s2">seasoned and large technological firms</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.500" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">and they just had to push this this</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.169" end="00:32:38.940" style="s2">Technol dystopia as a techno utopia and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:41.549" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t what they actually wanted for</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.940" end="00:32:42.659" style="s2">their own lives and in that experience I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.549" end="00:32:44.520" style="s2">came up with this I still haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.659" end="00:32:49.409" style="s2">written the essay the title for an essay</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.520" end="00:32:51.539" style="s2">and values schizophrenia and I I feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.409" end="00:32:54.149" style="s2">we&#39;re very often the professional roles</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.539" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">people are held in in the playing field</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.149" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">that is still rigged towards the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">degenerative system you create this</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:05.130" style="s2">value schizophrenia but where we and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:07.980" style="s2">that and reminds me of the famous</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.130" end="00:33:12.179" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller quote in the end only</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.980" end="00:33:15.390" style="s2">integrity is going to count so if if we</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.390" end="00:33:21.029" style="s2">step into clearly saying I&#39;m not gonna</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.029" end="00:33:25.559" style="s2">gonna speak to the real transformative</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:27.299" style="s2">values that I actually hold when I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.559" end="00:33:30.870" style="s2">of the future that I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.299" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">co-create and name these these these</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.870" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">idiosyncrasies inconsistencies but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:41.070" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a tricky one to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:42.990" style="s2">still stay in a job wonderful to hear</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.070" end="00:33:45.990" style="s2">that that there is so much movement now</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.990" end="00:33:48.659" style="s2">in throughout the entire spectrum of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.990" end="00:33:51.210" style="s2">built environment and is it is it mainly</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.659" end="00:33:52.380" style="s2">uko do you feel that this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.210" end="00:33:54.450" style="s2">popping up in lots of other countries</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.380" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">now as well I mean you said 22 countries</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.450" end="00:34:00.179" style="s2">but is it that the buzzes mainly in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:03.750" style="s2">UK with so-and-so declares or do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.179" end="00:34:05.429" style="s2">find that it&#39;s big going global uh well</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.750" end="00:34:08.669" style="s2">I mean they they&#39;re very active in</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.429" end="00:34:09.780" style="s2">Australia and portions the size of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.669" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">population they&#39;ve got way more</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.780" end="00:34:16.619" style="s2">signatures than we have ana de is also</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:21.030" style="s2">really active and I&#39;m just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.619" end="00:34:22.860" style="s2">the architects declare and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.030" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">hey my impression is that there&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.860" end="00:34:28.770" style="s2">a lot going on in France moment as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:32.360" style="s2">we wanted to be quite inspiring city</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:35.940" style="s2">mayors like Anne Hidalgo and and so on</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.360" end="00:34:39.030" style="s2">the Netherlands this is also pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.940" end="00:34:40.740" style="s2">active excellent so it is a globally</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.030" end="00:34:43.260" style="s2">growing movement that&#39;s really good to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.740" end="00:34:45.300" style="s2">hear the there&#39;s a couple of things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.260" end="00:34:49.770" style="s2">I&#39;d still wanted to get to one one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.300" end="00:34:51.570" style="s2">them is an update on what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.770" end="00:34:53.970" style="s2">with the Sahara forest project because</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.570" end="00:34:56.129" style="s2">like I included it in my book I still</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.970" end="00:34:59.130" style="s2">use it in slideshows but I&#39;m I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.129" end="00:35:01.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen that the prototype has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.130" end="00:35:06.270" style="s2">built there isn&#39;t a physical</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.640" end="00:35:09.510" style="s2">installation that runs yes we built a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.270" end="00:35:11.790" style="s2">prototype in Qatar that was open the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.510" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">Emir of Qatar during their 2012 i&#39;ma</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.790" end="00:35:18.900" style="s2">change talks mmm and so that worked</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:21.300" style="s2">extremely well we managed to grow</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.900" end="00:35:22.920" style="s2">cucumbers throughout the summer with</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.300" end="00:35:25.770" style="s2">half the amount of fresh water of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.920" end="00:35:27.660" style="s2">conventional approaches and we used that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.770" end="00:35:29.550" style="s2">opportunity to really test all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.660" end="00:35:33.240" style="s2">different elements of the system and to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.550" end="00:35:34.620" style="s2">monitor the regenerative benefits and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.240" end="00:35:37.170" style="s2">had hopes that we were going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.620" end="00:35:41.940" style="s2">to go straight through to commercial</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.170" end="00:35:44.970" style="s2">scale up in an but disappointing he odd</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.940" end="00:35:47.430" style="s2">joint venture partner it was joint</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.970" end="00:35:49.890" style="s2">venture with a Norwegian fertilizer</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.430" end="00:35:52.020" style="s2">company and the Qatar fertilizer company</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.890" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">and the Norwegians were absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.020" end="00:35:55.770" style="s2">delighted with its stake as a fertilizer</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:58.350" style="s2">company decided it wasn&#39;t close enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.770" end="00:35:59.940" style="s2">to their core business and so they</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.350" end="00:36:02.940" style="s2">decided not to proceed which was</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.940" end="00:36:06.150" style="s2">disappointing because you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.940" end="00:36:11.310" style="s2">do anything in castle without a joint</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.150" end="00:36:13.290" style="s2">venture katarina partner so after quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.310" end="00:36:15.720" style="s2">a bit of work trying to find an</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.290" end="00:36:18.450" style="s2">alternative there we we decided we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.720" end="00:36:21.510" style="s2">gonna have to relocate that&#39;s to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.450" end="00:36:28.370" style="s2">so we built a version in Jordan that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.510" end="00:36:30.030" style="s2">three times the size and that&#39;s des</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.370" end="00:36:31.610" style="s2">operating</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.030" end="00:36:36.780" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.610" end="00:36:41.610" style="s2">they there was a deal with a company to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.780" end="00:36:45.270" style="s2">supply veg register and vegetables to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.610" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">them so so you know it&#39;s is proceeding</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.270" end="00:36:51.300" style="s2">and but it&#39;s still quite tough you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:54.619" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t be as difficult as this</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.300" end="00:36:58.050" style="s2">really to realize projects like that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.619" end="00:36:59.970" style="s2">that that&#39;s partly because there are a</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.050" end="00:37:01.830" style="s2">lot of benefits that come out of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.970" end="00:37:03.600" style="s2">present like that&#39;s secondary benefits</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.830" end="00:37:06.630" style="s2">that aren&#39;t really accounted for in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.600" end="00:37:08.460" style="s2">conventional so you know we were eight</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.630" end="00:37:09.540" style="s2">we&#39;ve showed on the cat&#39;s-eye version we</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.460" end="00:37:11.520" style="s2">were able to achieve a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.540" end="00:37:15.600" style="s2">substantial regenerative benefit in</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.520" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">terms of the amount of plants and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.600" end="00:37:19.700" style="s2">animals that it returns to the sites and</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:21.960" style="s2">we were able to stabilize things ground</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.700" end="00:37:26.430" style="s2">sequester kind of a carbon into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.960" end="00:37:29.720" style="s2">soils and so on and yeah most of those</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.430" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">things are quite difficult to monetize</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.720" end="00:37:37.530" style="s2">return maybe but that&#39;s what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:40.440" style="s2">do if you&#39;re to compete with a very sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.530" end="00:37:43.080" style="s2">of hard commercial environment food</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.440" end="00:37:47.190" style="s2">growing I mean in that particular case I</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.080" end="00:37:49.260" style="s2">always felt that there for me when I saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.190" end="00:37:51.780" style="s2">the involvement of the large fertilizer</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.260" end="00:37:54.420" style="s2">companies and initially there was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.780" end="00:37:56.760" style="s2">little bit of a alarm going off and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.420" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">I sort of thought of it in in the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.760" end="00:38:02.520" style="s2">that I made sense of it for myself was</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:08.609" style="s2">that at the scale that it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.520" end="00:38:10.500" style="s2">envisioned of really bringing back micro</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.609" end="00:38:12.869" style="s2">climates in it like restoring the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.500" end="00:38:15.180" style="s2">hydrological cycle by bringing back</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.869" end="00:38:17.940" style="s2">trees around the coastal fringes of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.180" end="00:38:22.740" style="s2">Sahara and using that that technology</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.940" end="00:38:25.710" style="s2">then it&#39;s it&#39;s part of the transition to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.740" end="00:38:28.530" style="s2">use into external inputs to get it going</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.710" end="00:38:32.369" style="s2">but well once it it&#39;s that establishes</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.530" end="00:38:34.140" style="s2">itself it actually creates a cycle that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.369" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">but is much more localized in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.140" end="00:38:39.530" style="s2">nutrient flows and then you look and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:43.140" style="s2">into that part of it the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.530" end="00:38:44.049" style="s2">exporting fertilizers to feed the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.140" end="00:38:46.949" style="s2">like in</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.049" end="00:38:49.809" style="s2">fertilizers to feed the system yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.949" end="00:38:52.029" style="s2">I&#39;d recognize there are some tensions</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.809" end="00:38:53.499" style="s2">there but the the couple didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.029" end="00:38:56.529" style="s2">Asian company we were working with Yarra</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.499" end="00:38:58.089" style="s2">they they kind of Rican sieved of their</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.529" end="00:39:00.130" style="s2">company quite a few years ago now so</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.089" end="00:39:03.009" style="s2">that it was no longer just about</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.130" end="00:39:04.809" style="s2">manufacturing fertilizers they have</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.009" end="00:39:07.989" style="s2">rebranded themselves as experts in crop</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.809" end="00:39:10.709" style="s2">nutrition so they were very interested</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.989" end="00:39:13.420" style="s2">in some of the approaches that we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.709" end="00:39:16.359" style="s2">experimenting with that would use far</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.420" end="00:39:21.579" style="s2">less synthetic fertilizer so looking at</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.359" end="00:39:26.890" style="s2">biochar and even using seaweed to form</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.579" end="00:39:30.009" style="s2">mechanic fertilizers in stolen and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.890" end="00:39:33.239" style="s2">know for them their main interest was</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.009" end="00:39:36.489" style="s2">that they they&#39;re concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.239" end="00:39:39.429" style="s2">growth of desertification and they see</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.489" end="00:39:43.929" style="s2">potential for some use of fertilizers in</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.429" end="00:39:45.099" style="s2">reversing desertification and we were we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.929" end="00:39:47.170" style="s2">were trying to lead them more in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.099" end="00:39:52.239" style="s2">direction of organic fertilizers things</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.170" end="00:39:55.150" style="s2">in that effort well that&#39;s that&#39;s so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.239" end="00:39:56.799" style="s2">aligned with that kind of way of working</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.150" end="00:40:00.130" style="s2">of saying sometimes you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.799" end="00:40:02.829" style="s2">engage and you have to push people in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.130" end="00:40:07.739" style="s2">the process as you walk with them rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.829" end="00:40:11.589" style="s2">than say no you&#39;re doing it wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.739" end="00:40:14.499" style="s2">until you are perfect don&#39;t talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.589" end="00:40:19.539" style="s2">but it is always a fine line to decide</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.499" end="00:40:22.449" style="s2">where where to have that sort of weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.539" end="00:40:24.549" style="s2">still incremental improvements but</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.449" end="00:40:26.259" style="s2">possibly incremental improvements that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.549" end="00:40:27.999" style="s2">then create the conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.259" end="00:40:30.789" style="s2">transformative change for an entire</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.999" end="00:40:34.839" style="s2">industry to happen and in that place we</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.789" end="00:40:38.309" style="s2">need these these imperfect but catalytic</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.839" end="00:40:40.630" style="s2">projects well that&#39;s exactly yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.309" end="00:40:44.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve occasionally worked with companies</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.630" end="00:40:46.869" style="s2">that have a poor historical record and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.130" end="00:40:49.299" style="s2">makes the difference for me whether I</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.869" end="00:40:51.489" style="s2">will work with them or not is whether</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.299" end="00:40:53.829" style="s2">I&#39;m convinced that they are really</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.489" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">committed to transformative change if</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.829" end="00:41:00.150" style="s2">they are then happy to work with them</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:41:01.380" style="s2">this census if if I don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.150" end="00:41:03.979" style="s2">really committed and they&#39;re just doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.380" end="00:41:06.559" style="s2">it for Anna greenwashing then sorry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.979" end="00:41:09.720" style="s2">not gonna get involved</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.559" end="00:41:11.190" style="s2">before we end because you mentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.720" end="00:41:15.059" style="s2">side sentence the book you&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.190" end="00:41:18.329" style="s2">with Sarah I would love to you both your</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.059" end="00:41:21.089" style="s2">first book biomimicry an architecture</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.329" end="00:41:23.130" style="s2">and the book you&#39;re writing right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.089" end="00:41:26.940" style="s2">tell me a little bit more about those</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.130" end="00:41:29.249" style="s2">books sure so I&#39;m in McLean architecture</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.940" end="00:41:30.989" style="s2">I was commissioned to write that by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.249" end="00:41:33.749" style="s2">our apiary the Royal Institute of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.989" end="00:41:35.759" style="s2">British Architects and that was such a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.749" end="00:41:37.769" style="s2">pleasure you know it&#39;s like forcing</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.759" end="00:41:40.130" style="s2">myself to write a detailed manifesto for</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.769" end="00:41:43.410" style="s2">what I want to do with my company</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.130" end="00:41:47.339" style="s2">getting to meet and talk to a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.410" end="00:41:49.979" style="s2">best experts from around the world so</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.339" end="00:41:54.210" style="s2">that was a really useful process for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.979" end="00:41:56.670" style="s2">and this new one well with we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.210" end="00:41:58.710" style="s2">in the writing process at the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.670" end="00:42:01.019" style="s2">not sure when it&#39;s going to be published</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.710" end="00:42:04.710" style="s2">but each chapter is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.019" end="00:42:06.719" style="s2">describing a paradigm shift so the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.710" end="00:42:09.089" style="s2">one is about shift from sustainable to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.719" end="00:42:11.849" style="s2">regenerative and then we&#39;re going to go</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.089" end="00:42:14.940" style="s2">on to looking at how we need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.849" end="00:42:17.130" style="s2">radically transform our view of the rest</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.940" end="00:42:19.170" style="s2">of the living world and this is picking</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.130" end="00:42:21.420" style="s2">up on some of the work from</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.170" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">philosophically freya Matthews and also</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.420" end="00:42:26.999" style="s2">Jeremy Lent I particularly enjoyed his</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.630" end="00:42:30.299" style="s2">book instincts in which she&#39;s Sheridan</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.999" end="00:42:33.180" style="s2">if we carry on with a metaphor of nature</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.299" end="00:42:34.529" style="s2">something to be conquered then we sit</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.180" end="00:42:37.859" style="s2">there as trouble and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.529" end="00:42:40.229" style="s2">transform that as so that we see</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.859" end="00:42:41.759" style="s2">ourselves as part of a web of life</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.229" end="00:42:44.849" style="s2">support systems and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.759" end="00:42:49.769" style="s2">integrate yourselves insulin then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.849" end="00:42:52.349" style="s2">go on to to talk but transforming cities</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.769" end="00:42:54.599" style="s2">and rethinking our relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.349" end="00:43:00.329" style="s2">time and trying to think over longer</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.599" end="00:43:01.799" style="s2">time scales and we&#39;ll be looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.329" end="00:43:03.960" style="s2">whole issue of sort of growth and D</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.799" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">growth and our arguments will be that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.960" end="00:43:09.659" style="s2">what we need to head for is is actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:12.209" style="s2">a state of dynamic equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.659" end="00:43:14.339" style="s2">so I&#39;m not convinced by the framing of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.209" end="00:43:17.249" style="s2">the D growth pieces I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.339" end="00:43:19.649" style="s2">saying is great but the framing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.249" end="00:43:23.089" style="s2">problematic and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.649" end="00:43:26.759" style="s2">more likely to succeed if we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.089" end="00:43:29.009" style="s2">dynamic equilibrium dad does you have in</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.759" end="00:43:30.929" style="s2">biology systems with high levels of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.009" end="00:43:34.699" style="s2">growth decay and renewal existing</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.929" end="00:43:38.869" style="s2">balance and then we finished the book</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.699" end="00:43:41.969" style="s2">with a chapter about agency so this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.869" end="00:43:44.130" style="s2">about neither being impossible sorry</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.969" end="00:43:47.819" style="s2">neither being an optimist or a pessimist</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.130" end="00:43:52.799" style="s2">but instead being a possible issed that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.819" end="00:43:55.709" style="s2">maximizes their agency yes so those six</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.799" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">paradigm shifts we see is as crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.709" end="00:44:01.529" style="s2">really addressing the stain of emotions</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:04.309" style="s2">have you come across the quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.529" end="00:44:07.159" style="s2">years back I think it was in 2009 and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.309" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">Hazel Henderson and Fritjof Capra got</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.159" end="00:44:11.880" style="s2">commissioned by I think it was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:13.409" style="s2">British Institute for Chartered</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.880" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">Accountants or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.409" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">to write a in internal like a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:25.739" style="s2">monograph and that was called</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:28.019" style="s2">qualitative growth and they in it they</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.739" end="00:44:29.849" style="s2">distinguished again because I have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.019" end="00:44:32.429" style="s2">same sort of as a biologist and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.849" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">ecologist and Earth System scientists I</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.429" end="00:44:40.709" style="s2">feel uncomfortable with notions of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:42.839" style="s2">growth is bad and D growth but then of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.709" end="00:44:45.059" style="s2">course I understand enough about the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.839" end="00:44:47.669" style="s2">dysfunctionality of the current economic</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.059" end="00:44:49.319" style="s2">system and monetary system that I know</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.669" end="00:44:53.479" style="s2">that that kind of growth is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.319" end="00:44:56.819" style="s2">and and so so for me it&#39;s not it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.479" end="00:44:59.639" style="s2">redeeming growth as a word so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.819" end="00:45:01.619" style="s2">become a dirty word and by putting this</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.639" end="00:45:04.199" style="s2">qualitative growth in you you actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.619" end="00:45:05.819" style="s2">make like in in nature you things start</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.199" end="00:45:07.949" style="s2">growing exponentially normally</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.819" end="00:45:09.630" style="s2">populations and then eventually they</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.949" end="00:45:12.599" style="s2">have that inflection point and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.630" end="00:45:14.459" style="s2">shift from the logistic from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.599" end="00:45:19.049" style="s2">exponential curve to the logistic curve</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.459" end="00:45:21.389" style="s2">and and once they do that past the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.049" end="00:45:23.130" style="s2">inflection point the the journey is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.389" end="00:45:25.200" style="s2">qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.130" end="00:45:29.130" style="s2">like Justin you in our lines we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.200" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">growing in terms of dimensions some time</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.130" end="00:45:34.080" style="s2">ago but but then then you learn stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:37.170" style="s2">and you build relationships and you you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.080" end="00:45:39.660" style="s2">build tacit knowledge and experience and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.170" end="00:45:42.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the qualitative growth and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.660" end="00:45:46.020" style="s2">it fits well with with dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.420" end="00:45:50.360" style="s2">equilibrium which almost even more like</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.020" end="00:45:54.810" style="s2">bringing in the the adaptive cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.360" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">ecosystems change reminds us that there</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.810" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">will be phases where it&#39;s rapid growth</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:00.830" style="s2">and there will be phases where it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:03.869" style="s2">dissolution of structures and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.830" end="00:46:05.820" style="s2">negative growth but overall you need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.869" end="00:46:08.280" style="s2">keep them in an equilibrium and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.820" end="00:46:10.710" style="s2">buffer is through the panarchy that they</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.280" end="00:46:13.020" style="s2">it happens at different scales in</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.710" end="00:46:16.320" style="s2">different places at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.020" end="00:46:18.210" style="s2">then overall you create the equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.320" end="00:46:21.150" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s at least how our natural</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.210" end="00:46:23.750" style="s2">systems work oh yes well you you write</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.150" end="00:46:27.590" style="s2">about it very eloquently in your book</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.750" end="00:46:30.690" style="s2">and yes I&#39;m with you on that so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.590" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">wonderful and this has been been a joy</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.690" end="00:46:35.820" style="s2">to explore and I hope we have more</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:38.430" style="s2">opportunities to work together and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.820" end="00:46:41.400" style="s2">explore put putting our years together</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.430" end="00:46:43.020" style="s2">and also into practice let&#39;s see what we</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.400" end="00:46:44.970" style="s2">can dream up here on my yoga because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.020" end="00:46:50.119" style="s2">increasingly wanting to create projects</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.970" end="00:46:55.650" style="s2">where I live but I still sensed it</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.119" end="00:46:58.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge opportunity to work with</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.650" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">islands as models for by a regional</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.740" end="00:47:06.210" style="s2">change and a lot of these whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:07.830" style="s2">talking cities like like habit JIRA they</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.210" end="00:47:11.010" style="s2">wrote this lovely book on on</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.830" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">regenerative cities and friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.010" end="00:47:17.640" style="s2">alone through the Finland fellows and</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:19.260" style="s2">and again what he pointed out very early</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.640" end="00:47:21.960" style="s2">on when he did the footprint of London</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.260" end="00:47:23.760" style="s2">is is that if you want to transform</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.960" end="00:47:26.490" style="s2">cities you have to transform them within</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.760" end="00:47:28.980" style="s2">their region and we don&#39;t have good</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.490" end="00:47:31.590" style="s2">models of that yet but my hope here at</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.980" end="00:47:33.630" style="s2">the moment this is an invitation for</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.590" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">faster to collaborate is is that here in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.630" end="00:47:39.460" style="s2">Majorca</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:42.369" style="s2">having had a real shock to the main</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.460" end="00:47:44.500" style="s2">industry through all that 19 that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.369" end="00:47:47.349" style="s2">think sits deep enough that now people</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.500" end="00:47:49.420" style="s2">will hear the warning that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.349" end="00:47:51.730" style="s2">giving for 10 years of well you need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.420" end="00:47:55.780" style="s2">prepare for the times when tourism isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.730" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">as strong anymore now so you pray you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.780" end="00:48:00.190" style="s2">ready when the contraction happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:02.859" style="s2">rather than try to maximize profits</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.190" end="00:48:04.510" style="s2">until the very last moment and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.859" end="00:48:07.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s arrived in people and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.510" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a real possibility to explore</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.500" end="00:48:13.960" style="s2">how to turn a half a million people city</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:17.650" style="s2">in a million people region into in turn</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.960" end="00:48:19.780" style="s2">new direction islands are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.650" end="00:48:22.990" style="s2">because it&#39;s very obvious where the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.780" end="00:48:25.750" style="s2">physical limits are that&#39;s not always so</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.990" end="00:48:29.020" style="s2">clear with River City it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.750" end="00:48:31.300" style="s2">larger region so so yeah and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.020" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">in a pleasure to to work with you on</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.300" end="00:48:34.660" style="s2">something and thank you so much for</p>
