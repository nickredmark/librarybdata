<p begin="00:02:48.360" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">thinking so with World War two we add</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">the bomb and so then we had the period</p>

<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:09.380" style="s2">and fantasy being about nuclear</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.380" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">we had the Cold War and we had these</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.580" end="00:03:26.330" style="s2">beings were inherently a threat but then</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:29.400" style="s2">we had the period of global anarchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.330" end="00:03:33.959" style="s2">which was the collapse of legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.400" end="00:03:37.230" style="s2">authority and a decentralization such</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.959" end="00:03:39.570" style="s2">that the most dangerous actors are not</p>

<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:59.250" style="s2">worldview and by story that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.780" end="00:04:01.890" style="s2">have things like terrorism or those who</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.250" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">would rig the financial system to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.890" end="00:04:06.329" style="s2">collapse and then set up legislation to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">let them benefit from it as we saw a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.329" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">years ago on the positive side we see</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:14.730" style="s2">new forms of struggle and new forms at</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:17.190" style="s2">social justice and we see outpouring of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.730" end="00:04:20.370" style="s2">sympathy and compassion every time</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.190" end="00:04:22.200" style="s2">there&#39;s visible hardship when there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.370" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">hurricanes and earthquakes</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.200" end="00:04:27.420" style="s2">they&#39;re natural disasters of various</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:30.510" style="s2">kinds there are Wars and bombings and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.420" end="00:04:34.250" style="s2">the things like what happened in Paris</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.510" end="00:04:39.170" style="s2">recently or what&#39;s happening in Syria</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.250" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">living through this time one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.170" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">we can see is that the world is changing</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">more quickly image or actual the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:55.250" style="s2">is more complex than we humans are</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:59.190" style="s2">equipped to handle so we don&#39;t naturally</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.250" end="00:05:02.010" style="s2">see the world as emerging decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.190" end="00:05:05.580" style="s2">complexity we don&#39;t naturally see the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.010" end="00:05:08.090" style="s2">world as being systemically caused we</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.580" end="00:05:11.940" style="s2">don&#39;t naturally see the world as being</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.090" end="00:05:16.440" style="s2">accelerating and we don&#39;t naturally see</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:19.410" style="s2">exponential rates of change and yet that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.440" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">is what is happening it can be seen</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.410" end="00:05:25.640" style="s2">there are ways to see it there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">to learn to see it there is now an</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.640" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">abundance of knowledge in a way we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">too much knowledge meaning it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.560" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">than we know how to handle individually</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:42.630" style="s2">or at the level of our institutions</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:46.290" style="s2">we&#39;re now about 400 years into a period</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.630" end="00:05:49.560" style="s2">of analytic reductionism which means</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.290" end="00:05:52.070" style="s2">that we take real world holistic things</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.560" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">and we break them into artificials</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.070" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">simplistic parts because we can manage</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:05:59.670" style="s2">the simplicity of those parts so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:01.980" style="s2">divide the world into chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.670" end="00:06:06.120" style="s2">physics and biology psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.980" end="00:06:07.920" style="s2">anthropology sociology we divide the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.120" end="00:06:10.410" style="s2">world into categories so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.920" end="00:06:13.080" style="s2">make sense of it but in putting the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.410" end="00:06:15.540" style="s2">pieces together again we find that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.080" end="00:06:17.190" style="s2">have the problem of Humpty Dumpty we</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.540" end="00:06:20.790" style="s2">can&#39;t easily put the pieces back</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.190" end="00:06:25.020" style="s2">together again into our institutions</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.790" end="00:06:27.300" style="s2">having evolved mostly in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.020" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">this four-year 400-year trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.300" end="00:06:32.730" style="s2">analytic reductionism just the right of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:35.040" style="s2">the rise of modernity the rise of</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.580" end="00:06:43.560" style="s2">largely a Western phenomenon although</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.320" end="00:06:48.470" style="s2">it&#39;s been exported to the world and now</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.560" end="00:06:53.700" style="s2">we need synthesis we need holism we need</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.470" end="00:06:56.610" style="s2">inclusion we need participation and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.700" end="00:07:00.540" style="s2">now we need to depend on parts of this</p>
