<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">have an incredible conversation together</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">because</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">sounds fun cool so the first place that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">i&#39;d love to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">is the origin story which</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve dug into a little bit of yours</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">just from</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">certain podcasts that you&#39;ve given and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">have to say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">you have a very unique and novel</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">upbringing comparatively</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">to you know most people&#39;s upbringing i</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">and so maybe you could just share some</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">of your your background</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">and the upbringing you had</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">uh sure so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">novel upbringing uh i&#39;m imagining you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">mean i was uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">i was homeschooled growing up and i was</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">homeschooled by</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">uh really thoughtful parents who uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">had ideas about educational philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">uh childbearing and human naturalization</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">could work</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">and want to experiment on their kids</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">which was cool</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">and so our home school was set up</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">with no curriculum at all no fixed</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">curriculum so we did no</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">social studies math english etc</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">that were curriculum-based the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">instead which</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">is become more popular recently with uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">unschooling um the approach that we had</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">was so a little different</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">it was to expose us to as much as</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">possible to see what we were interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">in and then facilitate those interests</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">as fully as possible and so topics that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">i didn&#39;t express</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">interest in i never really learned and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">i i didn&#39;t learn much about</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">american history as a child because it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an area where my interest was</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">naturally peaked</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">and i never learned state capitals and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">et cetera my i didn&#39;t learn much in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">way of spelling my handwriting never got</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">legible</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">um but i did go deep in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">uh most of the sciences very early and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">then most of the philosophic traditions</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">and in many areas of activism and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">was kind of the braid</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">that all my interests fit into and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">the kind of uh educational philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">was that kids are intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">curious that there was evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">benefit to being curious being</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">fascinated and that if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">facilitate their fascination not only do</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">they become</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">uh masterful at things because they put</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">a lot of cycles</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">of earnest attention and energy because</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:12.720" style="s2">they&#39;re intrinsically motivated</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">but their interest in life continues to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">develop passion life is developed that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">when you don&#39;t facilitate kids interests</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">and you try to force them to do shit</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">that they&#39;re not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">that&#39;s how you kind of break people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">interests in life and they just want a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">bad job and watch tv</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">and so that ended up being true</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">uh in my case and um</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">one of the things that was real</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">interesting was since i didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">specific subjects there was no division</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">biology chemistry physics philosophy so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">an inquiry into the nature of something</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">and asking</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">why that is enough times usually led you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">know a trip around the universe asking</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">questions about why plants grew that led</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">soil biology that led to microbiology</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">that led to understanding what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">minerals were and how they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">formed in supernovas and that meant uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">you know astrophysics and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">cosmology got into</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">uh relativity and modern physics and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">know et cetera so</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">uh that led to not only kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">study across a lot of areas but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">relationship between those areas so</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">interdisciplinary science</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:22.800" style="s2">but more than that system science and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">the deeper philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.800" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">why does universe work the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">does across</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">all of those different domains which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">where the underpinning was really in</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">a philosophic system so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">little bit about the background and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">uh you know my dad was largely</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">uh interested in science and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">so i got a lot of support there my mom</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">was interested in the arts and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">humanities and activism</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:49.519" style="s2">and so as far as exposure goes she took</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">me to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">work with greenpeace and peta and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">embassy international and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">those kinds of things early and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">the impulse was from earliest on i can</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">remember and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">i see this impulse in all the kids that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.720" style="s2">i interact with and it&#39;ll express in</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">totally unique ways and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.720" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">my brother expressed very differently</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">but but the impulse was the same was to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:13.519" style="s2">understand the nature of the reality we</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">to understand what is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">meaningful and to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">how we can uniquely contribute to it in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">the way that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">you know most meaningful for us</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">childhood part</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:35.920" style="s2">and who are some of your mentors</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">that you paid attention to during your</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.920" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">upbringing and as your curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">fascination</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">on all these different subject matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">grew</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">who are some of the people that come</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that kind of come to your mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">immediately that played a big</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">role in your your kind of fascination</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">there were people that i actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">physically met who were mentors</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">but early on the kind of deepest</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">influences were</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">just the uh the philosophers scientists</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">teachers that i was fascinated by and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">got to be the basis of my curriculum so</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">first name that comes to mind is being</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">the probably the most significant early</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">intellectual influence for me was about</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">mr fuller</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">and as one of my dad&#39;s great heroes uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">bucky&#39;s work was my probably most common</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">early bedtime story as a kid even</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">before i was verbal and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">things is it&#39;s like as hard as it might</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">seem for us as adults to learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">a new language and especially a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:42.560" style="s2">different language say mandarin</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">uh baby who grows up hearing it learns</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">it no problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">well in the same way if we grow up</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">hearing the kinds of words that are in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">children&#39;s books we&#39;ll learn those if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">grow up hearing different kinds of words</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">we&#39;ll learn those</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">just as easily and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">you know my early words had a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:03.199" style="s2">with synergetic geometry and integrity</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">and because that&#39;s what i was exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.199" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">and um so above mr fuller</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">and design science and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">looking at how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">design technology that is both modeled</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">after how nature works and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">intentionally works</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">in in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">complex adaptive systems core part of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">early childhood development and then a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">systems thinkers advance in popularized</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">systems thinking so frichoff capra</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">irvin laszlo the people who developed</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">came in was</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">cosmos and carl sagan</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:56.079" style="s2">that and um you know in the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">traditions were very deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.079" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">for me so i</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">got to live in the in fairfield iowa in</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">one of the people that brought eastern</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">west he was a meaningful early influence</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">and that then led to lots of eastern</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">um western philosophy came a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">after that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:31.360" style="s2">and then you know the great activists</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">gandhi was a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.360" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">and profound early influence</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.959" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">are many many examples but uh i was i</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">was fortunate to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.199" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">have examples of great role models</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:48.839" style="s2">yeah i really and i really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">what you&#39;re sharing about the natural</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">curiosity and fascination that children</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">have with</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">learning and one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">really feel like i&#39;ve been a voice for</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">just in the subtle realms of my work</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">maybe when i go off on tangents or</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">something or i&#39;m working with parents</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">in particular i tend to really</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">focus in on a child&#39;s innate well not</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:13.679" style="s2">even just children but people&#39;s innate</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">tendencies what are they naturally</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.679" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">gravitating towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">and if they are given i guess i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">know the permission slip or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">given encouragement to pursue those</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">their intrinsic genius starts to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">come about where</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">you know for example our our industrial</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">education system doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">foster that type of environment right</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just kind of rinse repeat memorize</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">um and you know focus on the end result</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.919" style="s2">being a grade on your paper</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">and so i feel as though this</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">conversation is really important</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">and just for just to maybe plant a seed</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">in people&#39;s mind that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">that whatever whatever we&#39;re naturally</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">about is is leading us towards our</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">intrinsic genius does that does that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">sound about right to you yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">to just kind of um piggyback on that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">so the extension beyond childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">homeschool for me was</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">when i started college and again i was</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">well facilitated so i was fortunate to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">get to uh start college in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">young um i had no intention of getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">degrees and i had no idea what i planned</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">doing with any of the knowledge and kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">of vocation sense i knew i was</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">understanding reality and being</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">empowered by that to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">help shape civilization but i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.600" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">know what that looked like yet i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">know enough so</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">i got into mathematics and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">i was just passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">understanding how these</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">maximally abstracted principles of order</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">and relationship work</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">and so i just dove into mathematics and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">you know had all math classes at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">and my you know my parents</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">did ask you so do you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">i just i wasn&#39;t thinking that way at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">that there was deep innate fascination</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">for me and understanding this and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">at a certain point uh i</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">by no means understood all that one</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">could understand in mathematics which</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t even possible but uh but i got to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">a place where i</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">understood math well enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">that what the impulse that was driving</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.039" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">me there had found a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">completion it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">uh it wasn&#39;t actually just to work in</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">math it was to understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">how to think through induction and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">deduction and formal logic and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">uh you know et cetera to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">language that the sciences operated in</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:50.160" style="s2">and as soon as that happened my</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">attention moved my fascination was in</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.160" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">physics and then all of my attention was</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">just kind of deep diving and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">it moved to uh vedantic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">moved to medicine and moved to ecology</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">some people could think that that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">lack of focus and it was so clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:08.720" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.720" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">following a kind of natural process</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">that i wasn&#39;t crystal clear on i knew</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">was trending towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:19.919" style="s2">accumulating the skills and capacities</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">and insights</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.919" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">necessary to do what was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">mine to do even though i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">exactly what that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">but pretty much as soon as an area would</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">reach a completion of what i needed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">do with it in my opinion moved to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">next thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">until there was an adequate body of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">capacities that i could</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">actually put together what was really</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">mine to do which had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">whole systems design at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">civilization how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">uh fundamentally redesign the core</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:48.760" style="s2">axioms of civilization was a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.760" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">post-capitalism look like that has</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.000" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">uh incentives that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">don&#39;t externalize harm what is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">future of governance that has adequate</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.039" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">decision-making capacity to the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">decisions that we have to make in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">future look like as a future</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">infrastructure look like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">my focus was a whole system civilization</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">design and even though i intuited that i</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have said that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">but it actually needed the skills of all</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">of those things that i worked in</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">so there was a deeper than conscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">process guiding that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">it was pretty much what my fascination</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.480" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">was and so being allowed to follow that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">was a gift</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">that i uh wish for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">yeah yeah very well explained and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">what i wish for everyone too and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">funny what you mentioned about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">the hopscotching model of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">self-interest based education because</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">when i look back on my life it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">the same thing i was raised as a martial</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">artist</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">which caused me to be intimately exposed</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">eastern philosophy and and many</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">different modalities in that world and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">you know the last i would say eight or</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">nine years i&#39;ve been more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">science and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">learning the language of science or</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">different formats of science</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">um for example where growing up that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">wasn&#39;t something that i was interested</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">in so in my i naturally didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">proclivity towards it so therefore i</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t apply myself</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">and teachers probably assumed that um i</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">don&#39;t think i was ever assumed like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">dumb i was just like maybe i was assumed</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">just really bored or like all i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:29.679" style="s2">to do was</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:31.200" style="s2">go on a track and field and run or work</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.679" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">out or something</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.200" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">um however i do realize though as i got</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">older the link between this subject</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">matter being different forms of science</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">and things that i previously was not</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">interested in the link between that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">my purpose</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">now had been created therefore</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">you know that now there&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">natural proclivity to apply myself</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">because now i see how that matches up</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">with what i believe that i&#39;m here to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">on the earth so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s really fascinating um</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">and i want to use this as a segway i</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">really love what you&#39;re sharing i want</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">to use this as a segue to go into some</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">of the principles that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">share in some of your talks to further</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">expand upon</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:19.039" style="s2">just kind of what what your philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">or the philosophy that i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.039" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">working from is about</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">so maybe we can give the audience a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">basic foundational understanding on</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">your perspectives around the principles</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">of emergence and omni consideration</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">sure uh great topics</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">omni consideration is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">as inclusive a word</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">as i can think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">for uh if we have to kind of bring it to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.080" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">a single word core value or guiding</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">principle</p>

<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">could get which is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">think about everything that is affected</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">and impacted by an</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">any decision and how do we care so how</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">do we care about it</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">and then think through the actual</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">and factor the well-being of everything</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">why would that even be relevant well</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">it&#39;s relevant when</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">we recognize the first step of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">is when we recognize that we live in</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">there there really is no such thing as a</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">is no such thing as others where however</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">their quality of life is being affected</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">it&#39;s leading to their patterns of</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t have much technology</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a different set of rules in that</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:27.279" style="s2">it was possible to have win lose games</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a good idea but it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">possible and we did that so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">resource issues one tribe could kill</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">another tribe to have access to the</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">and you know that that could work when</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">you get to the level of</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">you know it went from we have conflict</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">uh if we can&#39;t figure it out we&#39;ll kill</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">each other and we&#39;re using stones</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">and then we&#39;re using spears then we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">and the wars are not winnable when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">cutting down</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">trees unrenewably but there&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">that many of us will came down with an</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">axe it&#39;s one thing when we&#39;re slashing</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">burning an acre a second it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve got the resource per capita</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">utilization we have now</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">times seven billion people the same way</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">well at the expense of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">means now</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">the life support system of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">can&#39;t continue to support us and we</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">other means unwinnable wars</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve basically got a level of power</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">that has obsoleted when we lose games</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">being possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2">anymore they&#39;re not even possible so now</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">we can continue to try</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.559" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">and have lose-lose gains or we have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">switch to fundamentally win-win games</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">which are not</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">zero sum which are fundamentally</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">and this is just a totally different uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">set of behavioral mechanics set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">thought processes</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">dynamics so omni consider it you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">part of the driver is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">we actually don&#39;t continue as a species</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">without moving into omni consideration</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">the welfare of the ocean so we continue</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">agriculture in a way that has nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">runoff lead to growing dead zones in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">oceans</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">and continue to do carbon emissions in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">way that leads to ocean acidification</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">and warming kills the coral</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t keep existing right if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">continue to do fishing in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">overfishes</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">the populations and so this is a key</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">is we are used to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">in modern times and the west</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">thinking of ourselves as individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">so i can think of me as if that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">separateable</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">concept and that i can think about my</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">own success</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">uh separate from the success of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">well it&#39;s important to get that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">actually a nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">concept it seems like it&#39;s a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:08.559" style="s2">but the only reason that i can think</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">about me at all is because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.559" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">biosphere that allows me to exist</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">and i just have to take that for granted</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">and say well of course there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">biosphere let&#39;s talk about me</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">if there&#39;s no biosphere there&#39;s no meat</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">right so without</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">oxygen i don&#39;t mean much without the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">plants that make the oxygen i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">much without the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">soil microbes that make the plants</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">possible make the oxygen without all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">the people that have come before me that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.399" style="s2">have created the technology that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">utilized that created the language that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.399" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">creates the linguistic structure of</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">thought through which i think and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">the me that i think of as me wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">exist at all and so i get</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">i&#39;m actually not separate from all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">that i&#39;m not an individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:49.919" style="s2">i&#39;m an emergent property of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">and as soon as i get that i am i as an</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.919" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">individual is actually just a bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">thought that is a misnomer right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">not understanding the dynamics well</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:00.559" style="s2">then the idea of separate interest just</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">becomes nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.559" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">because if i don&#39;t exist without plants</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">me damaging plants to advantage my</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make that much sense right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">especially as we get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve damaged plants enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">that we are close to tipping points of</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">being an existential idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">and so um omni consideration</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.480" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">is actually requisite</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">for our continued survival as a species</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">this is this is a big deal you know we</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:34.960" style="s2">think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">jesus or buddha like characters that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.960" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">would say kind of had this omni</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">character welfare of all sentient beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">but they were extreme outliers as we</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">move to the place</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">where exponential technology is</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">the impact that all humans can have and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s increasing it exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">how can we continue to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">exponentially more</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.559" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">impact without having exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">better choice making</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">and continue to make it or we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">and so we are our choice making being</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">omnipotent</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">which would be the result of it being</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">omni consider it right thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">if we consider a process could lead to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">omnipositive results</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">in a world that is this uh</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">and with this much scope of impact</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">that is actually the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">continue making it so</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:29.840" style="s2">this is a big deal because what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">saying is in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.840" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">in the face of population and in the</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">it&#39;s as if you know we can use the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">metaphor that we are merging into having</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">the power of gods</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">well the power of gods you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">better have the wisdom and the love and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">the discernment of gods or you</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">and so exponential technology</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">necessitates</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">that omni-considerate humans</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">become the new normal in the next very</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just a consciousness upgrade that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">that ripples throughout the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:44.840" style="s2">um which is this omni consideration</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.840" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">versus this self-consideration this this</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">self-centric model in which and which i</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">think we&#39;ve largely been conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">with right because when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">you know as a biological symbiotic kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">of organism</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">um the the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">uh what&#39;s the word i&#39;m trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">it&#39;s the program or the tendency is</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">cooperation right it&#39;s not competition</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not survival of the fittest it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">adaptability and cooperation so</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">naturally we want to work together</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:21.840" style="s2">naturally we want</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">we want the best welfare for all</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.840" end="00:32:25.600" style="s2">for for everyone and all creatures</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">however it just seems to me that we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">been culturally conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">to focus on ourself because of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">illusion or</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">maybe not so much the illusion in some</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">cases of scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s think about the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">of how we got here and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">radically oversimplify it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">to just share one of the causal through</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">lines</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">so say we go to uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:55.919" style="s2">shortly after the plow and agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">and early civilizations and they they</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.919" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">differentiated in different ways as we</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">would see people do and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">you know cultures do today we&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">and for whatever reasons environmental</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">reasons and etc</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">you had some cultures that were more</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">focused</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">on the arts and the humanities and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">spiritual traditions and less focused on</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">um militaries and expanding their</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">territory and you had other ones that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">were focused on the other side of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">and you can imagine it was a natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">gradient of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">possibilities for a number of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">and so we see</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.840" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">uh history of uh you know we see</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">archaeology of matrifocal</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">matriarchal societies that had less</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">violence that were more peace-loving as</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">a result they invested less in their</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">militaries and more in their arts</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:44.799" style="s2">and then whenever a militarized culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.720" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">met a more peaceful culture they killed</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">the peaceful culture and took their</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">and became and then applied their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">to their increased militarized capacity</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">and continued on and then when a couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">violent militarized cultures met the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">more successful one on a battlefield won</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:01.919" style="s2">and again assimilated the stuff of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">other ones and continued and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">there was a natural selection that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">occurred</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">but it was a natural selection of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">dominance capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">one in war and one and economic</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">competition and again economic</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">competition ended up meaning</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">uh how quickly we could extract</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">resources from the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">regardless of how whether they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">regenerating or not</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">and so we&#39;d have more economic capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">if we could pull</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">uh grains out even if it was divert</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:32.000" style="s2">diverse desertifying soil or if we could</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">pull out coal or oil depending upon the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:36.000" style="s2">time period we were at</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">and so what that means is because nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.000" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a balance sheet the better</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">that we raped the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">externalized harm to it the more</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">industrious we were and so the better</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">competed in the free market and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">better we competed at war the better we</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">did in that way</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">so there was this kind of natural</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">selection of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">effective cooperation of an in-group in</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">its competition with all-out group which</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">meant</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">its effective dominance capacity</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">we can see how we got here that way</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">but that wasn&#39;t a conscious selection</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">of what is actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">enduringly sustainable and viable or</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">that was true good and beautiful into</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">it was a unconscious selection</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">of what had dominance capacity</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">now and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">as we continue where our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">extract resources from the environment</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:36.079" style="s2">has hit tipping points of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">moving past peak resource on a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.079" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">key resources</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">we can&#39;t continue with that success</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">strategy we&#39;re almost out of the ability</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">to do that with many</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:45.920" style="s2">areas which means you&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">exponential curve up and then you hit a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">cliff and then it drops off</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">um you know we went from half a billion</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">people for</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">all of hominid history before the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">industrial revolution and the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">revolution&#39;s ability to extract</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">resources from the earth much faster</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">you know almost 7.2 billion people in</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">the blink of an eye</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">and that population increase was not</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">renewable resource utilization but</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">extraction of planetary savings accounts</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">and so again you when you hit the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">tipping point then you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">uh extreme drop off and we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">there or you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">some fundamental civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">restructuring which we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:34.000" style="s2">and so you know that has been the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">selection criteria</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.000" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.760" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">resource extraction or harm</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">externalization to the environment like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve done and we can&#39;t continue to win</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">wars where our technological capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">military</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">is too big for any war to be winnable</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">and so what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">how we&#39;ve dealt with these things for</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:55.440" style="s2">all of civilization since agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">till now</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.440" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">is not a way we can continue to deal</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">with it so we&#39;re looking at a phase</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">shift for civilization that is deeper</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">than anything we have in all of recorded</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">and this is a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">this is a big deal for us to get one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">the things that&#39;s so interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">when we think about evolution as this</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">kind of algorithmic process of what ends</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">up being adaptive now in an environment</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">but that leads to increased orderly</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">we get the orderly complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">prefrontal courtesies in humans and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">now with all the information we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">where we actually have the capacity with</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">abstraction to think about things like</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">evolution itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">and where it&#39;s trending and have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:38.720" style="s2">capacity for omni consideration</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:41.760" style="s2">where rather than just being part of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.720" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">big evolutionary dynamic we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.760" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">choose to participate with the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">of the whole we can become stewards of</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">the evolution of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">and not just focus on what&#39;s adapted now</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">but what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">a true and good and beautiful feature</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">that we&#39;re interested in creating</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">and i would say this is one way to think</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">about the phase shift</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">is a phase shift from unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:04.800" style="s2">algorithmic evolution of what&#39;s adapted</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">now based on dominance</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.800" end="00:38:11.280" style="s2">to a conscious evolution</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">mediated by conscious agents</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">that factors a forecasted future of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">true the good and the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">for everyone right that&#39;s normally</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">considerate and sustainable regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">and so evolution itself is evolving to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">being a more consciously agentically</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">mediated process where we become</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">stewards of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">i think this is a key way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">about the phase transition</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">right now yeah yeah absolutely i</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">um what comes to mind is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">the famous book the holographic universe</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">did you ever read that book by michael</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">tabbit</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">talbot yeah what do you what do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">think about that idea because</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">everything i hear i kind of maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">because i have my own cognitive bias</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">because i&#39;m i&#39;m redirecting certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">concepts back into a holographic</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">when i hear things like emergence when i</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:05.520" style="s2">hear macro and micro when i hear omni</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">consideration which to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.520" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">translates into the fact that our</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">thoughts words and deeds affect the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">um here&#39;s what what&#39;s your you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">what&#39;s your perspective on that whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:26.079" style="s2">there are patterns of self-similarity</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">at all scales uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">holograms are one way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">self-similarity</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">uh and fractals are another way</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">um things like the constructal law or</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">looking at you know branching dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a cardiovascular system or</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">a river network or</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">a tree root network so we see patterns</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">kind of similar structures</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">across scale and across areas because</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">they have to do with deep structures and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">so as far as this goes we look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">a holographic on the scale of what is in</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">the highest good of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">a person and what&#39;s in the highest good</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">all people and what&#39;s in the highest</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">good of all life when you factor all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">feedback loops will always be the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">it might seem like it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">benefit yourself at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">somebody else or the expense of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">future self</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">that&#39;s only because you&#39;re not factoring</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">some of the cause and effect feedback</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">loops of wherever you externalize</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">harm actually as you continue to follow</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">where that harm goes will come back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">affect you right</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">when you factor all of it it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">like you know cancer cells</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">start having their own agency</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">their own kind of process of growth and</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">be decoupled from their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">with all the other cells around them and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">then that result</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">the body then they die too</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.640" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">and so it actually doesn&#39;t end up being</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">and right now we can think about humans</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">is it just about plant-based versus</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">animal-based uh no of course not the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">argument that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">if people are eating uh sustainably</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">grown</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">organic mixed farm uh animal protein</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">compared to conventional agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">you know plant-based food that is you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">know pouring glyphosate into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">atmosphere and destroying uh ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">for row crop</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">then arguably the animal agriculture is</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">both more</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">you know sustainable and actually maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">even kills less net animals than what it</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">took to make that agricultural space</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">this is totally true</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">is it uh true that for some people being</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">is easier with certain animal products</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">in their diet</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">this is definitely true for many people</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">uh being vegetarian is actually easier</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">to be healthy</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">um but for some people for various</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:37.359" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">uh whether it has to do with um amino</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">acids</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">fatty acids uh heme iron uh etc some</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">people actually have a much harder time</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">being healthy on a vegetarian especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">vegan diet especially if they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">how well</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">and so then we deal with the ethics of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">their own kind of suffering so</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">i just want to say that i think the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">topic is really</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.119" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">important and warrants uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">nuance in its handling i think there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">core axioms of the whole conversation</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">because i think um manufactured meat</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">generated meat is going to be a</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">uh where we</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:25.839" style="s2">that they feel that they need it or for</p>

<p begin="00:45:25.839" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">want to eat uh animal protein</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:33.359" style="s2">would have the ability to do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">without the environmental implications</p>

<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">per kilo of meat generated is actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">profoundly low</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot of work to do to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">dial in the micro nutrition of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">but the combination of that with better</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">movement dynamics so i would say there</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">are ethically deep questions here</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">and they are being explored and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">should be explored so other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:03.760" style="s2">decide that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">don&#39;t eat any animal products at all or</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.760" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">they will eat</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">non-kale animal products so they&#39;ll eat</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">kill things below the certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">nervous system development they feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">good with and you ask questions like</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">well what about fungus fungus isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">plant or an animal what about</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">you know or they decide that they are</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">comfortable with mammals so long as they</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:22.720" style="s2">hunt them or wherever they decide to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">thinking through it and feeling through</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:29.440" style="s2">it deeply for their</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">own ethical alignment is key</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">and um i don&#39;t think anyone can think</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">and feel through it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">and decide that they feel good about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">ethics of factory farms</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:44.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t that&#39;s possible um</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">and as far as the ethics goes while</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of nuance to it</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">i think the pie slice theorem is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">really good place to start</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">right which is and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to be uh cutting</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">something in half and sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.359" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">generally the rule of thumb goes i cut</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:02.319" style="s2">it in half and you pick or you cut it in</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">half and i pick but</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">not i cut it in half and then i pick</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">because then i&#39;ll i&#39;ll cut it unevenly</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">and take the big cell</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">right so the question is would would i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">would i trade places and a part of an</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">ethical</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">relationship is that both sides are</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">benefit again a win-win</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">dynamic that we&#39;d be happy to trade</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">places because we actually feel good</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">the experience of both sides of any</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">interaction so we have to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">when i think into the sentient</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">experience of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">animal and the way that i&#39;m relating</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">would i trade places and do i feel okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">my effect on their sentient experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">uh we could do a whole podcast to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">deeper but i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:46.839" style="s2">asking that question earnestly is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">starting point i&#39;d encourage for</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.839" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">yeah i i really i really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">perspective i was recently</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:58.800" style="s2">on a podcast where someone was asking me</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">a very similar question</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.800" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">just my ethics around plant-based diets</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">and vegan and vegetarianism</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">and as he was talking two quotes came to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:12.319" style="s2">mind that really encapsulated my</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">general perspective one of them was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">ahimsa quote from the the aems</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">the eight limbs of yoga philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:22.880" style="s2">and which is basically do no harm to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">others and do no harm to our self and a</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.880" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">that quote is actually taken out of</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">context it&#39;s just do no harm to others</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">but it also has followed up with do no</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">harm to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:35.599" style="s2">which i think is part of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">sharing is that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.599" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">consideration</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">for loving others loving other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:43.839" style="s2">and loving ourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">enough to make sure that we are covering</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.839" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">our bases making sure that we cover</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">our blind spots as a sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">biological</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">organism so we&#39;re healthy and vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">um and then the other quote that came up</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">was by the the great alchemist</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">paracelsus</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:05.280" style="s2">who said that everything is poison</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:06.559" style="s2">everything is panacea it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.280" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">dosage</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.559" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">so that quote came up for me because i</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">said you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">if someone chooses to consume</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">meat and flesh products and animal</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">products that&#39;s their own</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">that&#39;s part of their own riddle you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">nutrition is largely a riddle</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">so you know i feel like a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">really has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">dosage you know in terms of uh meat</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">products my personal philosophy is if</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">somebody is going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">let&#39;s make that a condiment instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">main course let&#39;s do it therapeutically</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">instead of with with gluttony</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.119" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">if if one factor is particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">first quote that you shared</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">and they say okay my goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">reduce unnecessary suffering and harm</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:02.800" style="s2">to all life me and other life and to</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">optimize quality of life for me and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.800" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">other life</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">and then how do i make decisions aligned</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">if i can be vibrantly healthy</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">on just plant matter and i have good</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">reason to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">less suffering happens as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">just eating plant matter than eating</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:25.520" style="s2">plant</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">and animal matter because</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.520" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">more evolved complexity in animals than</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">plants nervous system you know more</p>

<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">response also means more capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.440" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">and the animal was eating however many</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">plants they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">uh you know in terms of the agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">feed to get there in the first place so</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:48.559" style="s2">you know if you bring up the argument</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:49.760" style="s2">about what about the sanctions of plants</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.559" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve done more</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">plant damage by moving the plants</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">through animals so</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:52:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty easy argument to make if</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">if if one can</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.880" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">not eat animal products and do well</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:11.359" style="s2">then it seems ethically</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">necessary to do so if one</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.359" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">does not know how to eat only plant</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">and do well and so where if they only</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.680" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">ate plant products they would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">and they would meaning they&#39;d have uh</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">mean carte blanche eat as much fat</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">refined meat as you want</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">there is a lack of nuance that i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">is pretty common where hardcore vegan is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">an easy position</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">and i eat meat is an easy position</p>

<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">um you know from the most humane</p>

<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">for the sake of time and um we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">down a few little rabbit holes which</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">have been cool</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">and i want to create the container</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">for the rest of this interview to dive</p>

<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">kind of this idea around neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">actually before we dive into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">particular product that you helped</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">formulate which i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">is absolutely brilliant and very</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">sophisticated which is why i wanted one</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">of the reasons i want to bring you on is</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:53.200" style="s2">share the details of it um as we get</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">into that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.200" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">can you share with us your interest in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">quote unquote neuro</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">hacking as it&#39;s popularly called</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">yeah so neural hack for us</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">really means uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">optimizing neurologic function and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:15.599" style="s2">optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">mind brain interface capabilities so</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.599" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">we think of biohacking generally meaning</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">any way of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">increasing function of the biologic</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">system and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">you know biohacking could really just be</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.839" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">um good health care</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">and good well-being i think part of why</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">the term hacking has caught on and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:39.920" style="s2">hacker ethos</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">is the hacker ethos was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.920" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">counter authoritarianism right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:45.119" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">authoritarianism in the medical</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.119" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">establishment process that</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">because of its inability to address</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">complex illness and the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">suffered from it while still having you</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">know uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">authorities hold a lot of rain on what</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">they think uh people shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:05.280" style="s2">as well as its inability to you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.200" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">really help people optimize there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.280" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">um the the hacking wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">nature is the mainframe and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">hack it as we want to work with nature</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:18.839" style="s2">but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">we are working um around</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.839" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">establishment i think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">reasons that the term caught on another</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">idea was that somebody could hack a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">computer system without understanding</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">all of the computer system they just had</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">to understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">ways of getting in which ended up</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">meaning a lot less information to still</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">a lot of capability so uh i think one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:40.400" style="s2">the other ideas in biohacking</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">and consciousness hacking all those</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.400" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">terms was</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">uh the the least amount of input</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">necessary to create meaningful output</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:53.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s i don&#39;t mean to interrupt but</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">i&#39;m just glad you said it that way</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">because my pet peeve</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">is about the last the least amount of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">effort to get the most amount of output</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">so i&#39;m glad you phrased it that way</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">your pet peeve is thinking that way no</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">my pet peeve is</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">other people using the term hacking like</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">bio hacking or business hacking or</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">life hacking as a way to get as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:18.720" style="s2">put in the least amount of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:20.000" style="s2">effort to get the most amount of results</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.720" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.000" end="00:56:23.040" style="s2">you know i think tim ferriss kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.040" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">did more than anybody at first to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">popularize that idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:29.920" style="s2">productivity hacking life hacking with</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">the four-hour work week and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.920" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">hey can i</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">automate a lifestyle for myself with uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">not as much time and then can i apply</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">that to body and other things and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:43.119" style="s2">idea of the pareto principle of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">there is a relatively small subset of</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">all the things one could do in a space</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">that can lead to much of the results of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">the space and let&#39;s start there</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a good principle now if there&#39;s 20</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">of the stuff you can do that will lead</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">to 80 of the results if you really care</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:57:00.079" style="s2">about the area you&#39;re not happy with 80</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">of the results and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.079" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">you know when you think about just</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:05.520" style="s2">increased</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:06.799" style="s2">leverage right where less input can</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.520" end="00:57:08.400" style="s2">create more output that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.799" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">necessarily mean you continue to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.400" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">lessons but it might mean you just start</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">exponentially more output because you</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">care more and you continue to invest a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">lot with just higher leverage strategies</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.119" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">right so neural hacking</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">you know why it&#39;s interesting for us</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">what is interesting for</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.720" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">me is when i looked at all of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.359" end="00:57:33.280" style="s2">dynamics in the world that we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">affect at a macro level</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">looked at war and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:43.359" style="s2">religious differences and violence and</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">biodiversity loss and you know etc</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.359" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">it was pretty easy to see that</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">one of the common denominators across</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">all those issues in different sectors</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">was that they were all being mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">and that in order to change any of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">we had to change human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">at scale and that all the solutions we</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">needed were going to be brought about by</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:11.119" style="s2">or they weren&#39;t right and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">what are all the things that influence</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.119" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">human behavior to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">directly cause harm to indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:20.960" style="s2">externalize harm</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">to uh work on solutions to work on</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:24.000" style="s2">solutions effectively</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">right like what are all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.000" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">influence those capacities and those</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">predispositions</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:31.760" style="s2">well it&#39;s the social systems do</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">economics and what you incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.760" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">has a huge effect the environment and</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.880" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">definition of self another has a huge</p>

<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">all like that but our physiology has a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.799" end="00:58:48.960" style="s2">huge effect</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.680" end="00:58:51.680" style="s2">and that was the part that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.960" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">address here uh we&#39;re used to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.680" end="00:58:55.359" style="s2">of kind of a nature nurture divide where</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:56.319" style="s2">nature is assumed to mean something like</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.359" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">genetics</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.319" end="00:59:02.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s fairly unchangeable and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">nurture equals other stuff but this is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.079" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">of course very outdated way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:09.319" style="s2">about it um</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:11.119" style="s2">are genetics mostly selected for</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.319" end="00:59:14.720" style="s2">neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">we don&#39;t run fast like cheetahs we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">fly like birds we don&#39;t swim very well</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">like fish we don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">many special capacities that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">physiologically built in but we can make</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:26.000" style="s2">tools that do any of those things better</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:28.559" style="s2">than specialists</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.000" end="00:59:30.160" style="s2">right we can again with our tools go</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.559" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">faster than cheetahs fly faster than</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.160" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">birds go deeper underwater than whales</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:37.040" style="s2">etc the strings of a gorilla is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">compared to that of a hydraulic press</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">and so we selected for the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">do abstraction and develop tools and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:45.280" style="s2">extend ourselves to those tools but that</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">tools those tools meant we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.280" end="00:59:47.839" style="s2">change our environment rapidly which</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:50.079" style="s2">meant</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.839" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">if we had fixed wiring when we were</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.079" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">adapted to our evolutionary environment</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">we would be unadapted to the new worlds</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:57.200" style="s2">that we&#39;d create so we had to</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="00:59:58.799" style="s2">have very little hardwiring so that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.200" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">could softwire to the new environments</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.799" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">creating which is why we&#39;re pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:06.079" style="s2">useless for the first year of our life</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">compared to a gorilla that can do stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.079" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">in the first five minutes a horse that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:12.799" style="s2">up and walking in the first few minutes</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:15.200" style="s2">is because we&#39;re born very neonos</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.799" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">we have a very long developmental period</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.200" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">because rather than have hardwired</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">behaviors we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:23.119" style="s2">uh radical plasticity for firm wiring</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">what is going to be adaptive to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.119" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">environment that we&#39;re born into and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">then we have continued neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">throughout life so basically evolution</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:33.280" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">only being able to change our behavior</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.280" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">through natural selection through</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:37.040" style="s2">breeding over a long period of time is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">very slow</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.040" end="01:00:40.799" style="s2">so we&#39;re evolving a creature that can</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">change its behavior radically just by</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.799" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">software updates</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">mimetics right which are mediated by you</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">neural coding and you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">neuroplasticity</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:53.200" style="s2">so genetics are genetics selected for</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">mimetics</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.200" end="01:00:57.200" style="s2">so rather than having genetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:59.400" style="s2">predispositions for really good or</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.200" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">really shitty behavior we have genetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.400" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">predispositions to be memetically</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">susceptible to whatever our conditioning</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">um and so mostly we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">conditioning</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:16.000" style="s2">but and i&#39;m stating that to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">the idea that we have evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.000" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">biology predispositions that just</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">inexorably suck</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t believe is well supported</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">but we can say that physiology uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">does affect patterns of human experience</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">and human behavior not even so much at</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">the level of genetics we could get into</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">that but at the level of just whether or</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">not the physiology is in tune</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">right so if hormones are out of balance</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">life is very different than if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">in balance brain chemistry is out of</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very different and so almost</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">everyone has experienced their</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.880" end="01:01:50.799" style="s2">physiology</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">being out of balance in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.799" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">affected their psyche affected their</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:56.640" style="s2">affected their cognition and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:01:58.319" style="s2">going to think of it as</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.640" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">when an instrument is out of tune you</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.319" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">kind of can&#39;t play anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:03.680" style="s2">on it no matter if you know how to play</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.039" end="01:02:06.480" style="s2">well or not</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.680" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">it sounds good so before we look at</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.480" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">upgrading our system right</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">making them get our guitar a better</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">guitar we just look at getting it in</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:15.240" style="s2">tune first</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:16.400" style="s2">we see there&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.240" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">predisposition</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.400" end="01:02:20.559" style="s2">for shitty behavior that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">untuned physiologies</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.559" end="01:02:25.000" style="s2">that is neurochemical imbalances</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:30.480" style="s2">hormonal imbalances</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.000" end="01:02:30.480" style="s2">microbiome imbalances etc that lead to</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:35.839" style="s2">less system resilience less emotional</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">resilience</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.839" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">less impulse control because when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:41.039" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">things we care about psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.039" end="01:02:46.799" style="s2">empathy perspective taking</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">complex thinking problem solving</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.799" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">impulse control etc those are all</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">mediated over certain neural circuits</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">involving certain neurochemistry and</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:02:57.839" style="s2">those can be physiologically up or down</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:00.319" style="s2">regulated</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.839" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">so neural hacking was interesting for us</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.319" end="01:03:04.640" style="s2">to say how can we</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:05.920" style="s2">take a more complex approach to how we</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.640" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.920" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">tuning the organism complex system</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:15.520" style="s2">science multifactorial etc</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.000" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">so that we can both decrease unnecessary</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.520" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">at the human level increase quality of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">life at the human level but also</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:23.119" style="s2">increase the capacity for and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:26.319" style="s2">predisposition for</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.119" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">that human becoming uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.319" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">an asset on nature&#39;s balance sheet</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">rather than liability</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">and how does how does qualia fit into</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.119" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.359" end="01:03:43.200" style="s2">yeah so quality is the first product</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.599" end="01:03:44.799" style="s2">that we have actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.200" end="01:03:47.520" style="s2">brought to market that&#39;s for sale we</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.799" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">have quite a few other products both</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.520" end="01:03:50.319" style="s2">additional versions of quality and</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">completely different products with</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.319" end="01:03:54.559" style="s2">different goals that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.480" end="01:03:56.160" style="s2">in various phases of development and</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">will come out</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.160" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">soon uh the reason why we started with</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:04.559" style="s2">qualia is</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">uh one</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.559" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">it was it&#39;s a familiar delivery</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.720" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.760" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">taking pills is much more familiar to</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.000" end="01:04:14.319" style="s2">people uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:16.240" style="s2">than strapping on eeg units or using</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.319" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">transcranial stimulation so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.240" end="01:04:19.200" style="s2">low barrier to entry in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">familiarity</p>

<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take very much will there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.880" end="01:04:29.440" style="s2">not much behavioral</p>

<p begin="01:04:29.440" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">that it has the capacity to not only</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:34.559" style="s2">have the effect that it has but it has</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.839" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">the effect of</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.559" end="01:04:37.680" style="s2">increasing one&#39;s capacity to do the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">other things that are harder to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.680" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">because of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:45.599" style="s2">its effect on uh motivational chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:46.400" style="s2">and so uh those were all reasons why we</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.599" end="01:04:49.200" style="s2">saw it as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.400" end="01:04:51.359" style="s2">as a meaningful starting place um and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.200" end="01:04:54.559" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.359" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">the desire to be productive is high for</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.559" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">everyone the demand</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">is high from you know just your life and</p>

<p begin="01:05:01.039" end="01:05:04.079" style="s2">view and from the point of view of if</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.480" end="01:05:05.839" style="s2">you&#39;re tuned into the world scenario and</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.079" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">you realize how much needs to</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.839" end="01:05:09.599" style="s2">happen there&#39;s a major demand to be you</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:13.520" style="s2">know creative and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.599" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">productive in shifting things uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.520" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">well we have more challenges to</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:20.960" style="s2">attention span from</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">more distractions and so we see</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.960" end="01:05:24.720" style="s2">increased you know maybe not in your</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.520" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">audience but we</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.720" end="01:05:28.720" style="s2">in in wide audiences increase adderall</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:31.200" style="s2">use increased</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.720" end="01:05:33.280" style="s2">smart brain five hour energy etc your</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.200" end="01:05:37.280" style="s2">group is probably doing adaptogens</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.280" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">um but uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.280" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">we wanted to see if we could make</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:44.720" style="s2">something that had a much</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">wider set of positive effects than</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.720" end="01:05:50.480" style="s2">those single molecule solutions had and</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">that had lastingly positive rather than</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.480" end="01:05:56.160" style="s2">lastingly negative effects because</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">you know single molecule pharmacological</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.160" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">usually psychostimulants will have an</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:03.200" style="s2">effect but it&#39;s usually quite narrow</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">right your adderall is going to affect</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.200" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">presynaptic</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">dopamine increase it&#39;s going to increase</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:12.400" style="s2">focus and concentration</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.480" end="01:06:15.760" style="s2">and drive but it&#39;s going to decrease</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.400" end="01:06:19.440" style="s2">uh task switching working memory</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.760" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">and oftentimes empathy um</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.440" end="01:06:26.640" style="s2">and then it&#39;s gonna override</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:28.640" style="s2">your and imbalance your own endogenous</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.640" end="01:06:30.559" style="s2">dopamine regulatory system which leads</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:32.799" style="s2">to down regulation independence we</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.559" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">wanted to see could we</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.799" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">increase concentration and focus so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:39.280" style="s2">could be highly focused</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.960" end="01:06:40.799" style="s2">while increasing task switching so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.280" end="01:06:42.480" style="s2">could move between tasks as needed</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.799" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">better simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.480" end="01:06:45.839" style="s2">while increasing long-term memory</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">short-term memory working memory speed</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.839" end="01:06:49.119" style="s2">of memory</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">and increasing analytic capability and</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.119" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">synthetic capability simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:57.119" style="s2">etc so how do we increase</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:07:00.160" style="s2">the capacity of all of those meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.119" end="01:07:03.359" style="s2">subjective experiences and cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.160" end="01:07:05.200" style="s2">capacities that go into creative</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.359" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">productive flow states where</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.200" end="01:07:09.760" style="s2">where uh you know cognition is uh fully</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:12.880" style="s2">available accessible</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:16.559" style="s2">and um that&#39;s to start by just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.880" end="01:07:17.039" style="s2">modeling what are all the capacities and</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.559" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.039" end="01:07:21.520" style="s2">that are desired and then we model what</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">what are the underlying physiologic</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.520" end="01:07:25.599" style="s2">mechanisms that mediate each of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:26.720" style="s2">what are the chemistries that affect</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">those mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.720" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">and then what are the chemistries that</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:31.839" style="s2">are generally well tolerated</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">whose effect on other systems is also</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.839" end="01:07:35.359" style="s2">positive and where we get positive</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:36.880" style="s2">synergies between</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.359" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">the chemistries and then that was the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.880" end="01:07:40.640" style="s2">beginning of our formulation process</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">and then you know many many cycles of</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.640" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">iteration to get to where it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.920" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">and what what are what are some of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.799" end="01:07:50.559" style="s2">the effects that you&#39;ve seen across the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:52.480" style="s2">board with people i mean i could easily</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.559" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">give my experience but i&#39;m i&#39;m about a</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.480" end="01:07:57.359" style="s2">month into it right now</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:07:58.240" style="s2">and i&#39;m just curious from your your</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.359" end="01:08:01.599" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.240" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">as the core formulator and also</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.599" end="01:08:05.760" style="s2">receiving testimonials from other people</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:07.359" style="s2">and also doing it yourself i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.760" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">like what what across the board do you</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.359" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">see is the most common</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">um enhancements or effects</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:19.759" style="s2">so first uh i will</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:21.040" style="s2">say for this podcast you know our</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.759" end="01:08:24.480" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.040" end="01:08:28.319" style="s2">medical disclaimer um of course</p>

<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:01.679" style="s2">things that people have reported so as</p>

<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:09.199" style="s2">people have reported um</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.839" end="01:09:11.199" style="s2">increased total working memory how many</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.199" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">things they can simultaneously hold and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.199" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">actually make good sense of</p>

<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:23.120" style="s2">like they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.759" end="01:09:26.239" style="s2">catch it that they actually have</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.120" end="01:09:28.080" style="s2">you know meaningfully increased verbal</p>

<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">uh a lot uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:51.199" style="s2">increased emotional resilience and drive</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:52.640" style="s2">both for the things they really love</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.199" end="01:09:54.480" style="s2">right things that people are motivated</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.640" end="01:09:56.640" style="s2">to do where they can actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.480" end="01:09:59.040" style="s2">stay on task for a much longer period of</p>

<p begin="01:10:09.360" end="01:10:12.800" style="s2">we didn&#39;t expect that we&#39;ve had so many</p>

<p begin="01:10:12.800" end="01:10:15.679" style="s2">they actually did their taxes and</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:17.040" style="s2">cleaned their desk and finish their</p>

<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:22.320" style="s2">because rather than it being an odious</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.400" end="01:10:24.000" style="s2">process they were able to just focus and</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.320" end="01:10:26.159" style="s2">and not have any drama about it so good</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.000" end="01:10:29.120" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.159" end="01:10:31.840" style="s2">decreased internal sense of drama was</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.120" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">also one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.840" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean emotional blunting</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">people still said they</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">you know would cry at inspiring things</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">and feel happy and grateful and feel sad</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:43.360" style="s2">when there was something</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:45.040" style="s2">real to feel sad about but they were</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.360" end="01:10:46.080" style="s2">making up less stories because they were</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">just thinking</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.080" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">so the bullshit thinking that led to a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.320" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">bunch of emotional reactions about what</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.080" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">decreased um and</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">uh increased vividness of dreams lucid</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:00.159" style="s2">dreams</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">now there&#39;s a lot of people that have</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.159" end="01:11:03.520" style="s2">claimed things for their medical</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:05.440" style="s2">conditions people with</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.520" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">you know many interesting medical</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.440" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">conditions have said</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:11.600" style="s2">that their conditions were meaningfully</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">decreased or gone but</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.600" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">again that&#39;s way outside the scope of</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">anything we&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.520" style="s2">talk about um and</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">you know it&#39;s important to say we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.520" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">make quality up to</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">uh cure conditions we did make it for</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">well people who are seeking optimization</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:32.400" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:34.719" style="s2">this would have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.400" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">wider scope of optimization than other</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.719" end="01:11:38.719" style="s2">solutions that were available</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:40.400" style="s2">and with less long-term negatives and</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.719" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">hopefully even long-term positives and</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.400" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">for people who have been</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:45.760" style="s2">using uh the product for a long time and</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">then used it</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.760" end="01:11:48.960" style="s2">and stopped taking it for a while and</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:50.719" style="s2">tracked their baseline</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.960" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">the report of long-term positives has</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.719" end="01:11:54.400" style="s2">continued</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:55.840" style="s2">that is a really important distinction</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.400" end="01:11:59.199" style="s2">isn&#39;t it because typically</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.840" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">in a supplement um it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.199" end="01:12:02.239" style="s2">it is something that we have to continue</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:04.719" style="s2">to take</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.239" end="01:12:07.199" style="s2">in order to derive the effects however</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.719" end="01:12:09.440" style="s2">in something like this the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.199" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">i guess the intention or maybe just the</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.440" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">side effect that has been noticed is</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:16.239" style="s2">that even when somebody stops taking it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:17.040" style="s2">their baseline resilience or their</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.239" end="01:12:20.640" style="s2">baseline</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:22.239" style="s2">cognition elevates to a new level where</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.640" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to keep taking it yet</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.239" end="01:12:26.800" style="s2">they&#39;re better off for</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:27.920" style="s2">taking it yeah and again we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:29.440" style="s2">the kind of research where we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.920" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">quantify that yet though we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.440" end="01:12:33.920" style="s2">early stages of gathering it</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:35.120" style="s2">um and we will have that you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.920" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">not too distant future we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.120" end="01:12:40.320" style="s2">excited about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">but in a dynamic system where you</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.320" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">continue to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:47.040" style="s2">lots of system inputs we don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:47.040" style="s2">any effect to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.199" end="01:12:51.440" style="s2">you know permanent just like exercise</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t meditation isn&#39;t someone to</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.440" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">meditate for a bunch of years and if</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:55.120" style="s2">they stop they can start getting more</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">stressed out</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.120" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">but as much of an effect as if someone</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:12:59.760" style="s2">has exercise they have really good</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:01.120" style="s2">fitness</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.760" end="01:13:03.040" style="s2">a few months later they&#39;re still in</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.120" end="01:13:03.760" style="s2">different shape than someone who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.040" end="01:13:06.400" style="s2">exercise</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.760" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">we were looking for a similar effect to</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.400" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">that which is if you have an upregulated</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:13.040" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:14.320" style="s2">uh there should be continuance of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.040" end="01:13:17.199" style="s2">up regulation</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.320" end="01:13:18.239" style="s2">until there is you know too much that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.199" end="01:13:19.600" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.239" end="01:13:21.440" style="s2">down regulating it and it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.600" end="01:13:22.880" style="s2">continued support right</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">through a couple mechanisms our</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.880" end="01:13:26.880" style="s2">intention was that if people were</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:29.199" style="s2">operating at increased efficiency</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.880" end="01:13:30.320" style="s2">continuously over a long period of time</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.199" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">that there would be</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.320" end="01:13:33.679" style="s2">actual new rewiring neuroplastic</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:36.960" style="s2">rewiring</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.679" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">along that state as baseline and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.960" end="01:13:40.400" style="s2">that we have a lot of chemistry that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:42.880" style="s2">focused on supporting</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.400" end="01:13:44.159" style="s2">endogenous processes of neurogenesis and</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.880" end="01:13:47.199" style="s2">synaptogenesis</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.159" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">so neural structuring processes so you</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.199" end="01:13:49.840" style="s2">don&#39;t feel those right away the things</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:51.760" style="s2">that you feel right away are things that</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.840" end="01:13:56.239" style="s2">are affecting neurotransmission</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.760" end="01:13:59.840" style="s2">but for longer term effects we looked at</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.239" end="01:14:01.520" style="s2">specifically chemicals that support</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.840" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">development of new synaptic structures</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.520" end="01:14:05.600" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:07.520" style="s2">new you know neurite formation and new</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.600" end="01:14:08.640" style="s2">progenitor stem cell neuron formation</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.520" end="01:14:10.640" style="s2">differentiation</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.640" end="01:14:13.760" style="s2">so that those endogenous processes could</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.640" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">happen in an upregulated fashion</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.760" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you could get not just</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:19.120" style="s2">chemical changes but structural changes</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:22.400" style="s2">where the structural changes</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:22.800" style="s2">uh you know would have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.400" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.800" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">more enduring</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.560" end="01:14:30.560" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a my my brain just went in</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.800" end="01:14:33.920" style="s2">a whole bunch of different directions</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.560" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">um however we don&#39;t have time for that</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.920" end="01:14:39.199" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:40.080" style="s2">so whoo okay so with all that said and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.199" end="01:14:42.719" style="s2">think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.080" end="01:14:44.080" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve already taken a huge we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.719" end="01:14:46.320" style="s2">taken everybody on</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.080" end="01:14:48.080" style="s2">a few different rabbit holes into some</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.320" end="01:14:49.760" style="s2">very um</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.080" end="01:14:51.679" style="s2">some very in-depth territory and</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.760" end="01:14:53.440" style="s2">especially this last part and i just</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.679" end="01:14:56.560" style="s2">want to i just want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.440" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">maybe add to this in and if if</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.560" end="01:14:59.840" style="s2">anybody if anything went over anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:02.480" style="s2">head i really</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.840" end="01:15:04.159" style="s2">invite everybody to continue to research</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.480" end="01:15:05.840" style="s2">maybe continue to listen to this</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.159" end="01:15:07.679" style="s2">interview and listen to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.840" end="01:15:10.480" style="s2">daniel&#39;s other interviews</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.679" end="01:15:11.520" style="s2">and content free content on youtube</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.480" end="01:15:14.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.520" end="01:15:15.679" style="s2">this man is obviously what i would call</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.159" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">a polymath which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.679" end="01:15:19.760" style="s2">um one of my colleagues john d martini</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:21.679" style="s2">who i had on the show recently</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.760" end="01:15:23.760" style="s2">he&#39;s obviously one and it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.679" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">somebody who has gained a certain level</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.760" end="01:15:27.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:30.159" style="s2">mastery in multiple disciplines</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.760" end="01:15:32.159" style="s2">and which is one of the reasons not only</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.159" end="01:15:32.719" style="s2">you fascinate me so much because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.159" end="01:15:35.199" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.719" end="01:15:37.199" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to optimize within myself</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.199" end="01:15:38.800" style="s2">because i have so many interests</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.199" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s just something that i have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.800" end="01:15:44.239" style="s2">great deal of respect for because</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:47.360" style="s2">i know the type of work and devotion</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.239" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2">to your craft it takes to really</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.360" end="01:15:51.120" style="s2">to really weed through all the</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.800" end="01:15:52.880" style="s2">distinctions and nuances to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.120" end="01:15:55.120" style="s2">critically think</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:57.360" style="s2">and extrapolate information the way that</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.120" end="01:15:59.840" style="s2">you do so for everyone listening</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">um you just continue to investigate</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.840" end="01:16:03.440" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.800" end="01:16:05.360" style="s2">and i really encourage everybody to</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.440" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">actually go to</p>
