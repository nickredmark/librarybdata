<p begin="00:01:29.400" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">about Jordan before he set out to save</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:35.430" style="s2">the world from itself Jordan was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">successful tech exec and tech investor</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.430" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">today is the chairman and co-founder of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">neuro hacker collective a nootropics</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">try huh well that is a quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.130" end="00:01:53.909" style="s2">groundbreaking you&#39;re a tough guy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">sell yeah exactly right old school</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.909" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">pretty much but I&#39;ll give you a report</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">on how it did yes I&#39;m the neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">website Jordan said something I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">which sort of sums up where he&#39;s at and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:08.039" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna read it and we&#39;ll go from</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.469" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">there as Jordan said Humanity in them is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.039" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">in the midst of a world historical</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:13.660" style="s2">transition which will likely kill all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:17.110" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.660" end="00:02:20.650" style="s2">Mad Max but just might end up in a truly</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.110" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">amazing future see Star Trek getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.650" end="00:02:25.030" style="s2">there is gonna require many things of us</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:27.880" style="s2">notably a significant upgrade of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.030" end="00:02:31.420" style="s2">individual and collective capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.880" end="00:02:33.610" style="s2">thought and action that&#39;s I think a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.420" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">really great way to sum up Jordans view</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.610" end="00:02:37.690" style="s2">of the world and those are his words</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.920" end="00:02:39.430" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk very briefly about how the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.690" end="00:02:41.050" style="s2">world could kill us but we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.430" end="00:02:43.030" style="s2">spend most of our time today I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.050" end="00:02:45.580" style="s2">about how to get past that and on to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.030" end="00:02:47.860" style="s2">better world so where are we what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.580" end="00:02:49.660" style="s2">happening in the world of game a where</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.860" end="00:02:53.140" style="s2">is the status quo headed if something</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.660" end="00:02:53.770" style="s2">isn&#39;t done okay well I think to make it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.140" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">quick</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.770" end="00:02:58.090" style="s2">right cuz we all you know spent a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:03:00.310" style="s2">previous podcast I think do me a deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.090" end="00:03:02.050" style="s2">dive on like a meta theory that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.310" end="00:03:03.610" style="s2">describes why this would be the case but</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.050" end="00:03:04.750" style="s2">one way that I&#39;ve thought about it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.610" end="00:03:07.810" style="s2">over the past is something along the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.750" end="00:03:09.640" style="s2">lines of in the context of Game a which</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.810" end="00:03:12.990" style="s2">is to say in the context of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.640" end="00:03:15.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve done civilization things forever</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.990" end="00:03:18.100" style="s2">the very first time that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.100" end="00:03:20.620" style="s2">found ourselves in a situation where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.100" end="00:03:22.660" style="s2">way that we ordinarily deal with things</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.620" end="00:03:24.280" style="s2">at the civilizational level ie at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.660" end="00:03:25.690" style="s2">end of the day if people really really</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.280" end="00:03:27.850" style="s2">don&#39;t agree on something they just fight</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.690" end="00:03:29.830" style="s2">it out it could actually be really bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.850" end="00:03:31.780" style="s2">like truly truly catastrophic was right</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.830" end="00:03:34.390" style="s2">after world war two so we suddenly found</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.780" end="00:03:36.340" style="s2">ourselves in this existential awareness</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.390" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">of oh like we actually have to do a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.340" end="00:03:39.250" style="s2">whole new thing we have to really be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:42.850" style="s2">good at something in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.250" end="00:03:44.110" style="s2">direction of peace because now if if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.850" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">people who are nuclear powers start</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.110" end="00:03:48.580" style="s2">throwing nukes around it could end</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:50.050" style="s2">everything and you know you in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.580" end="00:03:52.270" style="s2">generation were the first generation to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.050" end="00:03:54.580" style="s2">be developing in that consciousness the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.270" end="00:03:56.980" style="s2">consciousness of war is not merely bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.580" end="00:03:58.780" style="s2">and war is not merely you know destroys</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.980" end="00:04:00.820" style="s2">cities and nations but actually could</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.780" end="00:04:03.580" style="s2">kill everybody it was a big deal or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.820" end="00:04:05.890" style="s2">massive impact yeah I very much remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.580" end="00:04:08.020" style="s2">the duck-and-cover drills during the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.890" end="00:04:09.970" style="s2">Cuban Missile Crisis I think I was in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.020" end="00:04:11.800" style="s2">third grade of course it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.970" end="00:04:13.239" style="s2"> and wishful thinking since we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.800" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">were seven miles from the White House</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.239" end="00:04:17.380" style="s2">but nonetheless for the baby boomer</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:19.419" style="s2">generation the fact that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.380" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">thought there was a goodly chance we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.419" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">be blown up before we grown up it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.180" end="00:04:25.990" style="s2">significant part of who we were yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:27.320" style="s2">exactly and that that that way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.990" end="00:04:29.090" style="s2">deciding imploded before we growed up</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.320" end="00:04:32.210" style="s2">it and we really had to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.090" end="00:04:34.280" style="s2">to grow up as as a species pretty darn</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.210" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">quickly and we did right we&#39;ve so far at</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.280" end="00:04:36.980" style="s2">least have dodged that bullet and if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:38.480" style="s2">look at the history of it we actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.980" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">did dodged the bullet there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.480" end="00:04:42.650" style="s2">points where we got awfully close but</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:44.840" style="s2">and this is I think is a key insight is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.650" end="00:04:46.520" style="s2">that one of the drivers one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.840" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">things is that the deep deep code of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.520" end="00:04:54.730" style="s2">game a is an increase in technological</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:56.810" style="s2">capability and always in a context of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.730" end="00:04:58.610" style="s2">competition but what my friend Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.810" end="00:05:01.130" style="s2">would refer to as a rival risk game</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.610" end="00:05:03.380" style="s2">theory and so what that means is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.130" end="00:05:05.000" style="s2">gotten a lot better at all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.380" end="00:05:08.510" style="s2">things but among those things is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.000" end="00:05:10.280" style="s2">destroying stuff and what happens now is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.510" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">this the footprint of the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.280" end="00:05:14.480" style="s2">which we have to grow up continues to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:17.210" style="s2">have to accelerate at a pace that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.480" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">equal to our capacity to blow up and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.210" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">now we can look at things like say</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:26.210" style="s2">CRISPR which makes possible both in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:27.770" style="s2">terms of impact and in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.210" end="00:05:30.200" style="s2">number of people who can deliver that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.770" end="00:05:33.140" style="s2">impact the the risk risk footprint that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.200" end="00:05:35.780" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at biological style</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.140" end="00:05:39.670" style="s2">warfare that you know makes the scares</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.780" end="00:05:41.930" style="s2">of the 70s look well your depressant or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.670" end="00:05:44.600" style="s2">inadequate to the reality and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.930" end="00:05:47.210" style="s2">technology of gene editing is now</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.600" end="00:05:49.220" style="s2">crossing a threshold where large</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.210" end="00:05:51.800" style="s2">criminal enterprises will have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.220" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">capacity to do things that only the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.800" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">United States and the Soviet Union could</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.450" end="00:08:45.860" style="s2">cases right in the AI case this way the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.969" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">story is often told is it well if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.860" end="00:08:49.820" style="s2">don&#39;t get there before the Chinese were</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:51.589" style="s2"> right and so therefore people cut</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.820" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">corners don&#39;t don&#39;t do what they should</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:09:00.830" style="s2">nearing the end of its cycle which is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.540" end="00:09:02.390" style="s2">certainly seems to me that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.830" end="00:09:05.060" style="s2">reaching the limits or perhaps have</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.390" end="00:09:07.460" style="s2">already exceeded the limits of the long</p>

<p begin="00:09:12.350" end="00:09:16.940" style="s2">know that our population will peak at 10</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">or 11 billion and that more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.940" end="00:09:21.320" style="s2">more people are moving up the lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:23.210" style="s2">curve I do a closer to Western society</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.320" end="00:09:24.890" style="s2">oh it&#39;s it so it seems that even if we</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.890" end="00:09:28.940" style="s2">theoretical traps we&#39;re caught in</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.190" end="00:09:34.850" style="s2">own just drives over the cliff yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.470" end="00:09:36.290" style="s2">from my perspective that&#39;s that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.850" end="00:09:39.710" style="s2">or less the same thing but through a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.290" end="00:09:41.150" style="s2">different lens so when we say blow up we</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.710" end="00:09:44.060" style="s2">could talk about blow up in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.150" end="00:09:46.100" style="s2">like TNT who could also talk about it in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.060" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">the sense of you know puttin toxins into</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.100" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">the water supply they were we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:51.620" style="s2">breaking the feedback loops that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">maintained the homeostatic equilibrium</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.290" end="00:10:02.650" style="s2">so if you think what the logical you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.030" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">just said exactly as lifestyle is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.650" end="00:10:08.840" style="s2">cybernetically enhanced by technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:11.270" style="s2">we&#39;re outputting externalities into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.840" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">environment that are more and more the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.270" end="00:10:16.910" style="s2">magnitude just continues to increase and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">as more and more people are enabled by</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.910" end="00:10:21.740" style="s2">that technological footprint we just</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">have more energy and resources that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.740" end="00:10:27.620" style="s2">enable work it would be alive there</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:30.110" style="s2">creating more externalities blowing up</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.620" end="00:10:32.990" style="s2">and now the micro micro corrosion or</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.110" end="00:10:34.990" style="s2">toxicity and also as more and more of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.990" end="00:10:37.730" style="s2">those people are themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.990" end="00:10:39.850" style="s2">participating in more technology they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.770" end="00:10:48.770" style="s2">right so you can can in fact should look</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.660" end="00:10:50.690" style="s2">at it through both those lenses and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.770" end="00:10:54.020" style="s2">think those are kind of the same machine</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.690" end="00:10:57.970" style="s2">that&#39;s delivering the same impact and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.020" end="00:11:00.680" style="s2">leads to the conclusion that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.970" end="00:11:02.630" style="s2">unconscious drive and this game</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.680" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">theoretic drive if I don&#39;t do it then</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.630" end="00:11:07.010" style="s2">I&#39;m just I&#39;m not helping anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">because everybody else is or even worse</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.010" end="00:11:11.750" style="s2">I&#39;m losing</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">uh leads to the conclusion that it ends</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.750" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">like the game just has a finite point</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:16.370" style="s2">again Daniel&#39;s language I think is quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:18.200" style="s2">nice is that it&#39;s if you just run the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.370" end="00:11:19.670" style="s2">logic forward it&#39;s just you know put out</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.200" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">the model you see this crossover point</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.670" end="00:11:23.480" style="s2">through multiple different possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:26.060" style="s2">vectors but it&#39;s an extra balloon self</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.480" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">terminating Daniel also had a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.060" end="00:11:29.450" style="s2">line I don&#39;t think I got the words quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:31.430" style="s2">right but it was pretty close that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:11:36.110" end="00:11:39.080" style="s2">piece to it because I think this is or</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.250" end="00:11:41.660" style="s2">this is very salient and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.080" end="00:11:44.779" style="s2">important to grasp because you know we</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.470" end="00:13:32.980" style="s2">that gets us to the end of okay it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.359" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">least reasonably plausible that this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.980" end="00:13:37.089" style="s2">story ends badly and maybe even in not</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:38.199" style="s2">too long as you start looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.089" end="00:13:40.149" style="s2">numbers and see how they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.199" end="00:13:42.850" style="s2">evolving that then leads to the okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.149" end="00:13:44.230" style="s2">well what that what might else we do yep</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.850" end="00:13:46.989" style="s2">let me guys one last thing before we</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.230" end="00:13:48.759" style="s2">transition out that last bit about sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.989" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">making I&#39;ve come to start calling the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.759" end="00:13:53.379" style="s2">autoimmune disease on sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:55.239" style="s2">because essentially it&#39;s the tools we</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.379" end="00:13:57.639" style="s2">could be using for sense making that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.239" end="00:14:00.309" style="s2">have turned upon themselves just the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.639" end="00:14:01.809" style="s2">the an autoimmune disease our immune</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.309" end="00:14:03.489" style="s2">system which is supposed to protect us</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.809" end="00:14:05.559" style="s2">from disease actually becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.489" end="00:14:07.569" style="s2">disease you know diseases like lupus</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.559" end="00:14:09.100" style="s2">being a classic example I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.569" end="00:14:10.509" style="s2">reasonable model to say that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.100" end="00:14:12.040" style="s2">happening to our sense-making is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.509" end="00:14:14.049" style="s2">literally an autoimmune disease where</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.040" end="00:14:15.669" style="s2">the tools of sense-making have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.049" end="00:14:18.279" style="s2">turned on themselves in a diseased</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.669" end="00:14:19.689" style="s2">fashion but with that note it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.279" end="00:14:22.389" style="s2">move on so we don&#39;t spend all of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.689" end="00:14:24.309" style="s2">time talking about game a you and I and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.389" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">many folks we know call a possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.309" end="00:14:29.169" style="s2">better world or a trajectory towards a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:31.359" style="s2">better world game B and for those people</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.169" end="00:14:32.949" style="s2">out listening to the podcast who are</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.359" end="00:14:34.149" style="s2">interested in going beyond what we</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.949" end="00:14:36.239" style="s2">talked about today there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.149" end="00:14:38.949" style="s2">resources that are starting to become</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.239" end="00:14:41.410" style="s2">available on the Nets about game B</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.949" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a game B Facebook group a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.059" end="00:14:54.039" style="s2">really cool Google Doc with pointers to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.149" end="00:14:56.289" style="s2">lots of things about game B excerpts</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.039" end="00:14:58.119" style="s2">from podcasts really a cool thing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.289" end="00:15:00.609" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna put a link of that up on the</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.059" end="00:15:10.889" style="s2">let&#39;s go talk about Game B but just</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.730" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">before we do that I&#39;m gonna put a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.889" end="00:15:16.899" style="s2">warning or a flavor or something and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:19.689" style="s2">this again something you said game B is</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.899" end="00:15:22.029" style="s2">notoriously difficult to think and talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.689" end="00:15:24.279" style="s2">about for the very good reason that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.029" end="00:15:26.859" style="s2">you were using the conceptual structures</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.279" end="00:15:29.379" style="s2">that came out of game a to do so you may</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.859" end="00:15:32.049" style="s2">well be poisoning the well nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.379" end="00:15:34.799" style="s2">can you try and give us a reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.049" end="00:15:34.799" style="s2">succinctly</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.230" end="00:15:39.880" style="s2">yeah sure one of the ways that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.690" end="00:15:42.310" style="s2">noticed it seems to work in navigating</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.880" end="00:15:46.090" style="s2">the problem you just brought up is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.310" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">almost do a sort of parallax perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.090" end="00:15:53.740" style="s2">like try several different succinct</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:55.630" style="s2">constructions and then notice that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.740" end="00:15:57.430" style="s2">there&#39;s something about them that is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.630" end="00:15:59.470" style="s2">same thing and then you can say okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.430" end="00:16:01.090" style="s2">that in that direction so it&#39;s not any</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.470" end="00:16:03.160" style="s2">one of them but if you think about all</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.090" end="00:16:05.650" style="s2">of them and you kind of say hmm what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.160" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">the union of these feel like then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.650" end="00:16:08.890" style="s2">getting in the right direction so for</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:13.420" style="s2">example one of the constructions that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.890" end="00:16:16.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve put out is game B is building or</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.420" end="00:16:19.710" style="s2">developing capacity to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.060" end="00:16:22.960" style="s2">complexity without resorting to</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.710" end="00:16:24.700" style="s2">complicated systems obviously invoking</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.960" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">concepts like complexity and complicated</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.700" end="00:16:29.830" style="s2">to use that phrase but if those land in</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:32.200" style="s2">any way that&#39;s a nice pointer that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.830" end="00:16:34.290" style="s2">say okay we need that we need to figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.200" end="00:16:37.300" style="s2">out how to build an approach or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.290" end="00:16:39.780" style="s2">skillfulness in ourselves as as people</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.300" end="00:16:43.060" style="s2">individuals and groups to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.780" end="00:16:44.950" style="s2">respond to complexity and notice by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.060" end="00:16:46.270" style="s2">way we can actually now think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.950" end="00:16:47.560" style="s2">multiple different kinds of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.270" end="00:16:49.420" style="s2">there&#39;s natural complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.560" end="00:16:51.490" style="s2">natural environment and there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.420" end="00:16:53.470" style="s2">anthro pokum plex to the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.490" end="00:16:55.840" style="s2">people and possibly even techno</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.470" end="00:16:57.430" style="s2">complexity the complexity of the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.840" end="00:16:59.140" style="s2">that people can create technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.430" end="00:17:00.460" style="s2">changes the state of possibility in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.140" end="00:17:03.130" style="s2">national environment and these may be</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.460" end="00:17:06.850" style="s2">ontological different but to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.130" end="00:17:09.820" style="s2">complexity without resorting this is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.850" end="00:17:11.589" style="s2">obligate or knee-jerk requirement to use</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.820" end="00:17:14.020" style="s2">a complicated approach that&#39;s what game</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.589" end="00:17:16.630" style="s2">B is that another way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.020" end="00:17:19.449" style="s2">which I quite like is that the game B is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.630" end="00:17:22.120" style="s2">a meta protocol for hyper collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.449" end="00:17:23.829" style="s2">which would be fun to double click on</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.120" end="00:17:25.150" style="s2">that sounds real interesting why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.829" end="00:17:28.570" style="s2">you double click on that one a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.150" end="00:17:29.620" style="s2">bit sure so you mentioned that one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.570" end="00:17:31.030" style="s2">the reasons why we&#39;re even having this</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.620" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">conversation is that we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.030" end="00:17:35.470" style="s2">observed that there seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:38.740" style="s2">totally from our perspective at least a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.470" end="00:17:40.920" style="s2">totally spontaneous emergence of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.740" end="00:17:43.390" style="s2">gathering around and talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.920" end="00:17:46.390" style="s2">sort of Co discovering and co-creating</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.390" end="00:17:47.950" style="s2">this thing game B and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.390" end="00:17:48.850" style="s2">that is that you and I and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.950" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">other folks will</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.850" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">working on this as a group there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">group of people who are meeting together</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">in physical space and talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">notion and coming up with the language</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:01.750" style="s2">and beginning to try to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">years ago like six years ago and then we</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.750" end="00:18:05.049" style="s2">kind of stopped we just said you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:06.490" style="s2">okay we can&#39;t go any further from what</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.049" end="00:18:08.020" style="s2">we&#39;re doing right now we wouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.490" end="00:18:09.610" style="s2">what you called spore mode and we just</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.020" end="00:18:13.690" style="s2">sort of all spread to the four corners</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.610" end="00:18:15.190" style="s2">and did our thing and I suppose that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.690" end="00:18:17.710" style="s2">some of us somewhere had some</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.190" end="00:18:20.590" style="s2">conversations that it percolated out and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.710" end="00:18:22.690" style="s2">and some for some reason some portion</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.590" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">but we said was interesting and people</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.690" end="00:18:27.640" style="s2">began to upregulate it and that is led</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:30.190" style="s2">to what is more or less a spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.640" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2">emergence meaning that I didn&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.780" end="00:18:35.320" style="s2">of the people who are part of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.320" end="00:18:39.070" style="s2">as I can tell and and yet they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.990" end="00:18:40.690" style="s2">something and they&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.070" end="00:18:42.100" style="s2">that is really good it&#39;s really much in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.690" end="00:18:45.159" style="s2">the right direction so we have is like</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.100" end="00:18:47.049" style="s2">an emergent distributed cognition you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.159" end="00:18:49.090" style="s2">know it&#39;s a bunch of people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.049" end="00:18:51.490" style="s2">coordinated formally and don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.090" end="00:18:53.350" style="s2">top-down structure that drives their</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.490" end="00:18:54.789" style="s2">coordination and yet they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.350" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">actually collaborate and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.789" end="00:18:59.260" style="s2">generating things that are real and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">useful and here&#39;s a here&#39;s a key piece</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.260" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">this was meta protocol they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:07.780" style="s2">generating things that are able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:11.140" style="s2">support the orientation of other people</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.140" end="00:19:18.669" style="s2">distributed cognition so it&#39;s a bhoot</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:22.090" style="s2">protocol it&#39;s a way for a person anyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.669" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">anywhere to be able to suddenly have</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.090" end="00:19:27.130" style="s2">this sense of who for example things are</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.710" style="s2">really up but what might I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.130" end="00:19:31.150" style="s2">when they start looking around huh this</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.710" end="00:19:33.100" style="s2">person over here who&#39;s having this</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.150" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">conversation seems to be saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.100" end="00:19:36.309" style="s2">interesting things let me follow that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:37.990" style="s2">thread a little bit and as I follow the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.309" end="00:19:39.669" style="s2">threat of one one person who just</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.990" end="00:19:41.289" style="s2">happens to catch my attention is having</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.669" end="00:19:43.150" style="s2">something that seems relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.289" end="00:19:44.830" style="s2">interesting I might notice that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.150" end="00:19:46.539" style="s2">have hash tag game be in their Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.830" end="00:19:48.130" style="s2">identity so I&#39;m like okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.539" end="00:19:50.200" style="s2">interesting and so I search for that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.130" end="00:19:51.820" style="s2">as you say I see this huge conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.200" end="00:19:53.110" style="s2">of people that are going on and one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.820" end="00:19:54.789" style="s2">the things that I find is I find a</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.110" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">Google Doc and so I go into the Google</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.789" end="00:19:58.750" style="s2">Doc and inside the Google Doc I see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:01.570" style="s2">people have collaborated on creating</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.750" end="00:20:02.410" style="s2">pointers to podcasts and pointers to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.570" end="00:20:04.810" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.410" end="00:20:07.420" style="s2">and linkages to conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.810" end="00:20:08.920" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a you know a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.420" end="00:20:10.450" style="s2">coffee shop like a virtual coffee shop</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.920" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">that people are having conversations at</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.450" end="00:20:15.010" style="s2">and meetups are beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:16.390" style="s2">self-organize and now I can on my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.010" end="00:20:18.610" style="s2">not necessarily with any top-down</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.390" end="00:20:21.130" style="s2">guidance begin the process of orienting</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.610" end="00:20:24.160" style="s2">myself on what this is and finding my</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.130" end="00:20:26.920" style="s2">way into participation that seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.160" end="00:20:28.420" style="s2">meaningful to me and then allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.920" end="00:20:30.910" style="s2">begin the process of on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.420" end="00:20:33.580" style="s2">discovering more and more on my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.910" end="00:20:35.910" style="s2">terms using my own way of knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.580" end="00:20:37.960" style="s2">world what the hell&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.910" end="00:20:39.310" style="s2">finding ways that I can actually add</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.960" end="00:20:41.920" style="s2">value to it that again are</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.310" end="00:20:44.740" style="s2">simultaneously meaningful for me they</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.920" end="00:20:46.090" style="s2">seem like a good idea and add value to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.740" end="00:20:49.960" style="s2">the whole they are creative to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.090" end="00:20:50.890" style="s2">larger project and so that&#39;s one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.960" end="00:20:52.660" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.890" end="00:20:55.090" style="s2">actually happening and so in the in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.660" end="00:20:57.130" style="s2">context if we if we take this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.090" end="00:20:59.740" style="s2">that game be is a meta protocol for</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.130" end="00:21:02.140" style="s2">hyper collaboration what I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.740" end="00:21:06.970" style="s2">say this phrase hyper collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.140" end="00:21:09.400" style="s2">makes the proposition that in funny I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.970" end="00:21:11.770" style="s2">really stealing this from a from Eric</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.400" end="00:21:13.510" style="s2">Weinstein who taught me this this move</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.770" end="00:21:15.190" style="s2">that apparently is the thing that one</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.510" end="00:21:17.650" style="s2">does in in certain kinds of mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.190" end="00:21:19.690" style="s2">is that everyone is currently playing</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.650" end="00:21:23.170" style="s2">game bay but you might be playing game</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.690" end="00:21:24.520" style="s2">be at level zero meaning that it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.170" end="00:21:27.220" style="s2">always it&#39;s fully present its</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.520" end="00:21:29.320" style="s2">omnipresent it&#39;s in the field of what of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.220" end="00:21:31.660" style="s2">play and at any point you could simply</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.320" end="00:21:32.890" style="s2">choose to step into it and if you did</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.660" end="00:21:35.050" style="s2">you would be able to move from zero to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.890" end="00:21:37.660" style="s2">something epsilon greater than zero and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.050" end="00:21:39.970" style="s2">then you begin to the process of more so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.660" end="00:21:42.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a ten people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.970" end="00:21:45.130" style="s2">playing game B but rather everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.490" end="00:21:48.070" style="s2">but most people aren&#39;t consciously</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.130" end="00:21:49.660" style="s2">choosing to do so in a in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.070" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">will increase their skillfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.660" end="00:21:53.590" style="s2">collaboration with other people so</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:55.720" style="s2">that&#39;s when I say hyper collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.590" end="00:21:57.370" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that then the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.720" end="00:22:00.010" style="s2">piece of it is this if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.370" end="00:22:02.350" style="s2">if everyone is playing game b-but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.010" end="00:22:04.600" style="s2">matter of how skillfully and consciously</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.350" end="00:22:08.440" style="s2">are you doing so then you get this</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.600" end="00:22:10.420" style="s2">really interesting event and it looks a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.440" end="00:22:12.010" style="s2">lot like a really neat way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.420" end="00:22:15.000" style="s2">understanding this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.010" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">synchronicity which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.000" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">today so whatever it is nearly noon my</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:23.970" style="s2">time on Wednesday I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this this woman in Toronto who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.970" end="00:22:28.549" style="s2">currently working on something with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:31.260" style="s2">collaborative team in Bulgaria</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.549" end="00:22:33.990" style="s2">consciously in the space of game B but</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.260" end="00:22:35.490" style="s2">very much from their perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.990" end="00:22:37.650" style="s2">what I really don&#39;t know is that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.490" end="00:22:39.179" style="s2">what they&#39;re working on is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.650" end="00:22:43.710" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m going to need in six</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.179" end="00:22:45.240" style="s2">weeks and yet perhaps it&#39;s the case and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.710" end="00:22:47.370" style="s2">perhaps what happens is is that in six</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.240" end="00:22:48.710" style="s2">weeks precisely as I&#39;m getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.370" end="00:22:50.460" style="s2">point where I really need this thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.710" end="00:22:53.070" style="s2">something has happened that has</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.460" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">increased my capacity to be aware of or</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.070" end="00:22:58.200" style="s2">at least to find quickly those things</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">that I need and so exactly like I show</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.200" end="00:23:01.980" style="s2">up on a look well I need this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:03.570" style="s2">I kind of come back up and I look back</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.980" end="00:23:06.750" style="s2">out and I look into the larger game B</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.570" end="00:23:08.669" style="s2">meta protocol and I start seeing asking</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.750" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">questions and suddenly somebody said oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.669" end="00:23:10.980" style="s2">yeah I was talking to this group in</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:12.090" style="s2">Bulgaria that I think we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.980" end="00:23:13.919" style="s2">something like that let me connect you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.090" end="00:23:15.690" style="s2">to them and two conversations later I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.919" end="00:23:17.789" style="s2">having exactly the right conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.690" end="00:23:19.260" style="s2">with people who on their own have</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.789" end="00:23:20.820" style="s2">actually been working on something which</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.260" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">perfectly supports or at least</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:25.260" style="s2">meaningfully supports what I&#39;m doing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:27.799" style="s2">so I&#39;m calling that hyper collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.260" end="00:23:32.280" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s something like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.799" end="00:23:35.460" style="s2">explicitly formally defining the terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.280" end="00:23:37.530" style="s2">of our collaboration but because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.460" end="00:23:39.000" style="s2">all actually looking at a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.530" end="00:23:41.100" style="s2">it&#39;s just a problem in reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.000" end="00:23:42.990" style="s2">out there we can each take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.100" end="00:23:45.419" style="s2">pieces of it that make sense to us and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.990" end="00:23:47.400" style="s2">if we each are able to focus on those</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.419" end="00:23:50.549" style="s2">pieces with clarity and then we</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.400" end="00:23:52.919" style="s2">communicate with fidelity and with we</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.549" end="00:23:54.510" style="s2">might call it integrity out what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.919" end="00:23:56.580" style="s2">doing why we&#39;re doing it and are ready</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.580" end="00:24:00.990" style="s2">in orienting our attention towards those</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.500" end="00:24:03.809" style="s2">things that seem to be most fully in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.990" end="00:24:06.330" style="s2">alignment with our own direction the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.809" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">things we&#39;re trying to do and with what</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.330" end="00:24:10.710" style="s2">is emerging in the larger whole then</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.030" style="s2">what happens is we start finding that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.710" end="00:24:14.130" style="s2">are actually collaborating with people</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.030" end="00:24:16.500" style="s2">we didn&#39;t even know that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.130" end="00:24:18.750" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s amazing because you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.500" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">our first run at game B never quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.750" end="00:24:24.149" style="s2">caught fire but I&#39;m now seeing that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:26.460" style="s2">deep principles we laid down are</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.149" end="00:24:28.500" style="s2">actually an important part of the self</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.460" end="00:24:30.750" style="s2">booting and self growing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.500" end="00:24:33.450" style="s2">I think the three we chose as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.750" end="00:24:35.490" style="s2">top-level architectural attributes of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.450" end="00:24:37.830" style="s2">game be watching two of them are</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.490" end="00:24:40.260" style="s2">architectural that&#39;s and the third is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.830" end="00:24:43.460" style="s2">goal heuristic for a goal is it would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.260" end="00:24:47.160" style="s2">non hierarchical network oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.460" end="00:24:49.500" style="s2">long-term metastable and all three of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.160" end="00:24:51.270" style="s2">those things seem to be the metastable</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.500" end="00:24:54.150" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how long-term it is but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.270" end="00:24:56.430" style="s2">other two things really seem to be or</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.150" end="00:24:59.910" style="s2">what&#39;s driving the self booting and self</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.430" end="00:25:01.740" style="s2">growing aspect of game B 2.0 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.910" end="00:25:03.480" style="s2">actually doing it just like we said that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.740" end="00:25:06.120" style="s2">it would but we somehow didn&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.480" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">out how to do it back then it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.120" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">interesting to me that those principles</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:11.580" style="s2">turned out to be right they just had to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:14.340" style="s2">have a different set of people on</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.580" end="00:25:16.980" style="s2">different set of Technology tools and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.340" end="00:25:19.320" style="s2">different mindset people&#39;s minds have</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.980" end="00:25:21.150" style="s2">grown over the last six years to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.320" end="00:25:24.450" style="s2">point where I think this these ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.150" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">much much more accessible and people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.450" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">willing to lease and also of course the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:30.570" style="s2">situation and game a has become more</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:32.670" style="s2">obviously worse and so people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.570" end="00:25:35.940" style="s2">willing to do a bit more work to explore</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.670" end="00:25:37.860" style="s2">an alternative right so I apologize if</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.940" end="00:25:41.610" style="s2">what I&#39;m about to do feels like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.860" end="00:25:44.940" style="s2">oblique turn but it feels like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.610" end="00:25:46.530" style="s2">good thing too right now talk about why</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.940" end="00:25:51.450" style="s2">we might have optimism that this</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.530" end="00:25:56.070" style="s2">metastable is possible and almost like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.450" end="00:25:59.340" style="s2">I&#39;m meta frame for why we might have</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.070" end="00:26:02.040" style="s2">optimism that the game B is not just</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.340" end="00:26:03.300" style="s2">possible but actually has a lot going</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.040" end="00:26:04.590" style="s2">for it both in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.300" end="00:26:06.150" style="s2">magnitude of the challenges that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.590" end="00:26:07.890" style="s2">trying to deal with and the context of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.150" end="00:26:09.080" style="s2">its struggle with game a does that seem</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.890" end="00:26:10.950" style="s2">like a good place to go right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.080" end="00:26:13.260" style="s2">hilariously you went there cuz that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.950" end="00:26:15.060" style="s2">my next point which is game a is huge</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.260" end="00:26:16.650" style="s2">and powerful game B doesn&#39;t even exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.060" end="00:26:18.690" style="s2">yet all right but why should we be</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.650" end="00:26:20.610" style="s2">optimistic so we&#39;re on the same page go</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.690" end="00:26:23.220" style="s2">for it okay and there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.610" end="00:26:25.980" style="s2">that&#39;s about to happen as this is we</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.220" end="00:26:27.180" style="s2">move into this so I would just my sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.980" end="00:26:28.230" style="s2">this is probably going to be quite rich</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.180" end="00:26:30.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.230" end="00:26:33.000" style="s2">different implications which can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.990" end="00:26:36.330" style="s2">explicate it in the time that we have so</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.000" end="00:26:40.230" style="s2">I would just want us to listen closely</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.330" end="00:26:42.970" style="s2">and allow exploration to come so</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.230" end="00:26:44.889" style="s2">recently on your podcast we had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.970" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">conversation with Stuart Coffman who</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.889" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">discussed the adjacent possible and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:52.899" style="s2">talked about something in the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:55.749" style="s2">possible that has this characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.899" end="00:26:57.940" style="s2">a faster than exponential growth just to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.749" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">kind of compress it to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.940" end="00:27:01.419" style="s2">there&#39;s foolish people who don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:02.889" style="s2">to all of your podcasts i&#39;ve have access</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.419" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2">to this concept it&#39;s something that i</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.889" end="00:27:07.499" style="s2">think Stewart is noticed in a number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:10.710" style="s2">different domains so as diverse as</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.499" end="00:27:13.240" style="s2">chemical primordial soups and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.710" end="00:27:14.769" style="s2">technological economies but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.240" end="00:27:17.350" style="s2">something along this line which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.769" end="00:27:20.649" style="s2">you&#39;ve got stuff you&#39;ve got basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.350" end="00:27:22.389" style="s2">components and to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.649" end="00:27:24.610" style="s2">there are ways to combine these</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.389" end="00:27:27.490" style="s2">components in ways that generate</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.610" end="00:27:28.840" style="s2">something that has novel capacities</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.490" end="00:27:32.049" style="s2">which is to say we cannot describe it as</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.840" end="00:27:34.330" style="s2">a new thing we&#39;re now expanding the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.049" end="00:27:35.889" style="s2">set of components and so we haven&#39;t lost</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.330" end="00:27:38.139" style="s2">a component we&#39;ve gained a component so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.889" end="00:27:40.509" style="s2">never sets larger and then we can run a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.139" end="00:27:41.590" style="s2">combinatorial against it and again to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.509" end="00:27:43.389" style="s2">the extent of that combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.590" end="00:27:46.570" style="s2">generates an expansion some new</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.389" end="00:27:48.100" style="s2">capacities emerge you get a an expanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.570" end="00:27:50.350" style="s2">field but the number of possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.100" end="00:27:51.879" style="s2">expands and expands faster than</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.350" end="00:27:53.559" style="s2">exponential and so it very actually goes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.879" end="00:27:54.820" style="s2">to infinity in a finite time which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.559" end="00:27:55.769" style="s2">its own problem we&#39;ll deal with talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.820" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">about that later</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.769" end="00:28:00.220" style="s2">but like in the thing that moves faster</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:03.100" style="s2">than exponential as a characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.220" end="00:28:05.769" style="s2">being quite flat for a while is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.100" end="00:28:07.389" style="s2">starts relatively slow and then it has</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.769" end="00:28:08.440" style="s2">this curve and as it goes into the curve</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.389" end="00:28:12.580" style="s2">it gets steeper and steeper and steeper</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.440" end="00:28:14.980" style="s2">I bring that up because if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.580" end="00:28:18.220" style="s2">the relationship between gaming and game</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.980" end="00:28:24.610" style="s2">B what we might say is that the game a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.220" end="00:28:27.129" style="s2">is defined by a very high state or stock</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.610" end="00:28:29.619" style="s2">of power it is big and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.129" end="00:28:31.269" style="s2">it&#39;s like a big oil tanker that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.619" end="00:28:33.269" style="s2">driving forward there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.269" end="00:28:35.080" style="s2">momentum and inertia to what it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.269" end="00:28:37.419" style="s2">and for that matter it actually has a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.080" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">pretty high rate of increase in power</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.419" end="00:28:44.730" style="s2">but when you&#39;re in the acceleration and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:48.149" style="s2">the deepening of the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.730" end="00:28:52.259" style="s2">differences even small differences in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.149" end="00:28:53.470" style="s2">capacity to ride that curve to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.259" end="00:28:57.340" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.470" end="00:28:59.890" style="s2">or elles faster make huge differences</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.340" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">you know the slightly higher exponent</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.890" end="00:29:04.750" style="s2">makes all the difference in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:05.620" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and by the way I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.750" end="00:29:08.020" style="s2">say that this is something we can just</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:10.600" style="s2">we could just notice if you if you look</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.020" end="00:29:14.409" style="s2">at the way the game a itself has had to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.600" end="00:29:16.870" style="s2">evolve to maintain competitive advantage</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.409" end="00:29:19.960" style="s2">inside game a let&#39;s just do it in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.870" end="00:29:23.110" style="s2">context of military so for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.960" end="00:29:24.970" style="s2">just having more people matter that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.110" end="00:29:28.059" style="s2">just the raw capacity of the human body</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.970" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">was the decisive factor you know even</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.059" end="00:29:31.900" style="s2">sticks and stones and thence you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:34.600" style="s2">suddenly went swords say for example or</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.900" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">Spears were developed if you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.600" end="00:29:39.220" style="s2">that level of technology you were deeply</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:40.600" style="s2">in trouble but once you did it fell back</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.220" end="00:29:42.809" style="s2">on the human body right and you just</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.600" end="00:29:46.059" style="s2">keep going here&#39;s watch the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.809" end="00:29:49.150" style="s2">military power but as you start moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.059" end="00:29:50.740" style="s2">past the the beginning of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.150" end="00:29:53.380" style="s2">century you begin moving into one more</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.740" end="00:29:55.630" style="s2">one and particularly as you move through</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.380" end="00:29:59.140" style="s2">World War two it becomes increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.630" end="00:30:02.289" style="s2">obvious the human power ain&#39;t the thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.140" end="00:30:04.690" style="s2">and technology power innovation power</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.289" end="00:30:08.400" style="s2">has become the thing and these are</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.690" end="00:30:10.870" style="s2">different the approach to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.400" end="00:30:12.970" style="s2">amassing a large number of people and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.870" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">disciplining them into a fighting body</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.970" end="00:30:15.220" style="s2">that has the capacity to throw human</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.220" end="00:30:21.730" style="s2">strategically had a problem that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.830" end="00:32:11.810" style="s2">also inhibits creative collaboration so</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.650" end="00:32:12.980" style="s2">what we notice is that if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.810" end="00:32:15.740" style="s2">support creative collaboration if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.980" end="00:32:18.110" style="s2">just look at what those people who are</p>

<p begin="00:32:18.110" end="00:32:22.040" style="s2">that better and better how they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.610" end="00:32:23.120" style="s2">it they&#39;re beginning to orient towards</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.040" end="00:32:25.220" style="s2">something that begins to look an awful</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:28.730" style="s2">lot like I&#39;m at a protocol for hyper</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.730" end="00:32:32.840" style="s2">look a lot more like how do we actually</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.790" end="00:36:25.740" style="s2">day the animals are active how often do</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.580" end="00:36:28.080" style="s2">they have to go to the waterhole etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.740" end="00:36:31.050" style="s2">yeah exactly I see even as she is you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.080" end="00:36:33.030" style="s2">use that and very concrete example one</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.050" end="00:36:35.340" style="s2">of the key insights here is that this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:37.320" style="s2">all it&#39;s all what I would call embodied</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.340" end="00:36:38.670" style="s2">meaning that you&#39;ve experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.320" end="00:36:41.220" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually learned it through</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.670" end="00:36:42.599" style="s2">experience and we can think about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.220" end="00:36:45.810" style="s2">is to say that it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.599" end="00:36:47.880" style="s2">recorded in a very very rich way like</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.810" end="00:36:50.310" style="s2">think about your whole body as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.880" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">instrument for perceiving and also for</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.310" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">making sense and your as a hunter with</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.780" style="s2">50 years of experience you have what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">would call wisdom in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.780" end="00:37:01.260" style="s2">hunting and one of the characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:03.089" style="s2">of wisdom of the domain of hunting is</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.260" end="00:37:04.349" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a like a deep sense like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.089" end="00:37:07.980" style="s2">sense like because kind of into your in</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.349" end="00:37:10.440" style="s2">your bones of how this this dilemma of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.980" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">hunting how rich and complex it is and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.440" end="00:37:16.140" style="s2">so you&#39;re like able to say with no</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:18.359" style="s2">hesitation if I&#39;m a woods hunter and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.140" end="00:37:22.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve shift to the desert I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.359" end="00:37:24.240" style="s2">know what I do not know very true yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.380" end="00:37:27.510" style="s2">like to go to the tangible as you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.240" end="00:37:29.609" style="s2">an example of say woodland deer hunting</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.510" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">it takes a while to develop is really</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.609" end="00:37:33.900" style="s2">valuable and important is you know how</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:36.839" style="s2">to master multiple modalities</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.900" end="00:37:38.339" style="s2">particularly vision and sound it turns</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.839" end="00:37:40.530" style="s2">out you can waste a whole lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.339" end="00:37:43.050" style="s2">learn jumping around looking for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.530" end="00:37:44.490" style="s2">that sound is that a deer or not and in</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.050" end="00:37:46.860" style="s2">fact as a young hunter I remember</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.490" end="00:37:49.050" style="s2">doing that way too much once you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.860" end="00:37:50.700" style="s2">enough experience it all depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.050" end="00:37:52.950" style="s2">person some of them get it earlier so</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.700" end="00:37:55.650" style="s2">I&#39;m get it later you have a high</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.950" end="00:37:58.440" style="s2">fidelity ability to say nope that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.650" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">squirrel or that&#39;s two squirrels one</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.440" end="00:38:02.369" style="s2">chasing the other not a deer in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:04.350" style="s2">case you keep your eyes where the higher</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.369" end="00:38:06.869" style="s2">probability of payoff for vision is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.350" end="00:38:10.770" style="s2">while your auditory senses continue to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.869" end="00:38:12.630" style="s2">scan horizontally looking for sounds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.770" end="00:38:15.330" style="s2">deer and this is important because you</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.630" end="00:38:17.730" style="s2">can only look in a relatively narrow 60</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.330" end="00:38:19.260" style="s2">degree angle with high fidelity and yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.730" end="00:38:20.910" style="s2">the deer could be sneaking up on you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.260" end="00:38:23.580" style="s2">from any direction or trying to bypass</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.910" end="00:38:26.340" style="s2">you from any direction and sound is your</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.580" end="00:38:27.810" style="s2">second sense that often times will give</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.340" end="00:38:29.730" style="s2">you a warning that a deer is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.810" end="00:38:31.470" style="s2">sneak by in which case you then orient</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.730" end="00:38:34.020" style="s2">your vision to what where your sound</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.470" end="00:38:36.450" style="s2">tells you to look but that only works</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.020" end="00:38:39.960" style="s2">well if you can filter out the non deer</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.450" end="00:38:41.940" style="s2">sounds mm-hmm yeah and my I guess from</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.960" end="00:38:43.890" style="s2">exploring these sorts of things and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.940" end="00:38:45.900" style="s2">can do this in and it literally any-any</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.890" end="00:38:46.890" style="s2">this is a kind of liminality or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.900" end="00:38:48.810" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re talking about which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.890" end="00:38:52.410" style="s2">to say beginning and liminality and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.810" end="00:38:54.900" style="s2">building from direct experience in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.410" end="00:38:56.180" style="s2">holistic way I was no prefiguring of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.900" end="00:38:58.440" style="s2">what the right answer might look like</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.180" end="00:39:00.630" style="s2">actually just sophisticated real</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.440" end="00:39:01.950" style="s2">capacity the way that uh John would make</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.630" end="00:39:04.230" style="s2">you would talk about is participatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.950" end="00:39:06.750" style="s2">knowing meaning that you are yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.230" end="00:39:08.430" style="s2">actually changing your capacities in</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.750" end="00:39:09.740" style="s2">relationship to the domain or to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.430" end="00:39:12.420" style="s2">arena that you&#39;re in you&#39;re becoming</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.740" end="00:39:14.100" style="s2">capable of conforming to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.420" end="00:39:15.840" style="s2">domain that you&#39;re in I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.100" end="00:39:17.820" style="s2">that as you begin to become more and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.840" end="00:39:20.310" style="s2">more mature more certain more capable as</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.820" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">a hunter you would even begin to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.310" end="00:39:24.869" style="s2">describe it as sort of sixth sense right</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:26.310" style="s2">you&#39;ve got one sense to sense and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.869" end="00:39:27.930" style="s2">like wow at a certain point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.310" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">beginning to realize that you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.930" end="00:39:31.320" style="s2">analytically I can&#39;t really talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:33.560" style="s2">vision or sound but there&#39;s some way for</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.320" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">me to just kind of be call it like</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.560" end="00:39:38.100" style="s2">perceiving and I just kind of have an</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:40.050" style="s2">inkling that this is the right place to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.100" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">go and that&#39;s like that difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.050" end="00:39:43.980" style="s2">between you know we&#39;re learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:46.650" style="s2">juggle when you go from two balls to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.980" end="00:39:48.119" style="s2">three balls and there&#39;s a point where</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.650" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">you are trying to juggle three balls</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.119" end="00:39:52.619" style="s2">like a two plus one and you notice like</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:54.920" style="s2">that really doesn&#39;t work and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.619" end="00:39:57.090" style="s2">shift that happens that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.920" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">analytically name because it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.090" end="00:40:01.039" style="s2">complex that&#39;s the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:02.809" style="s2">a very large number of subsystems of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.039" end="00:40:05.299" style="s2">your body or perceptive and agenda or</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.809" end="00:40:07.220" style="s2">actuating functions but once you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.299" end="00:40:08.210" style="s2">over that hump and you get it like oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.220" end="00:40:09.770" style="s2">yeah well how do you juggle three balls</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.210" end="00:40:11.539" style="s2">well you kind of juggle three balls like</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.770" end="00:40:13.339" style="s2">you you realize that it&#39;s an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.539" end="00:40:15.650" style="s2">capacity to you it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.339" end="00:40:17.660" style="s2">available and you can become very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.650" end="00:40:19.220" style="s2">very good at it but it&#39;s not the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.660" end="00:40:21.890" style="s2">thing that is analytically describable</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.220" end="00:40:23.839" style="s2">as a simple set of algorithmic processes</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.890" end="00:40:28.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.839" end="00:40:30.920" style="s2">complex set that well that&#39;s that so</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.460" end="00:40:32.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that that direction let me just</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.920" end="00:40:33.559" style="s2">have a couple just you know get tangible</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.359" end="00:40:35.210" style="s2">examples in hunting because you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.559" end="00:40:37.220" style="s2">that no longer your hunting the more</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.210" end="00:40:39.020" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to juggle a very high</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.220" end="00:40:42.049" style="s2">dimensional space that you cannot even</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.020" end="00:40:43.700" style="s2">think about doing analytically for</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.049" end="00:40:45.619" style="s2">instance there&#39;s you know there&#39;s vision</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.700" end="00:40:48.470" style="s2">and they&#39;re sound but you also</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.619" end="00:40:51.650" style="s2">eventually unconsciously bias both of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.470" end="00:40:54.950" style="s2">those based on time of day where you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.650" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">on a corns versus grass as the leading</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.950" end="00:41:00.049" style="s2">food source right so and that varies by</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">year some years are great acorn years</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.049" end="00:41:05.089" style="s2">some are spotty acorn years some are</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:07.400" style="s2">completely busted acorn years acorns are</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.089" end="00:41:10.460" style="s2">stronger earlier and gradually get eaten</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.400" end="00:41:12.380" style="s2">so they go back to grass etc so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.460" end="00:41:14.299" style="s2">a whole number of these dimensions that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.380" end="00:41:16.309" style="s2">are kind of hard to be explicit about</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.299" end="00:41:19.069" style="s2">but once you become a an experienced</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.309" end="00:41:21.260" style="s2">hunter it goes into your real-time model</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.069" end="00:41:23.480" style="s2">how you tune your vision and your and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.260" end="00:41:25.039" style="s2">your sound based on all these other</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.480" end="00:41:27.529" style="s2">parameters that you&#39;ve only gradually</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.039" end="00:41:29.900" style="s2">learned so anyway we&#39;re over here in</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.529" end="00:41:32.539" style="s2">time let&#39;s let&#39;s not go too far down oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.900" end="00:41:34.430" style="s2">we both have that tendency yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.539" end="00:41:35.809" style="s2">just a good thing here to sit to say it</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.430" end="00:41:37.369" style="s2">it just comes from this if anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.809" end="00:41:40.670" style="s2">listening so to convert this from a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.369" end="00:41:43.490" style="s2">digression into something useful is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.670" end="00:41:47.869" style="s2">humility is the handmaiden of liminality</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.490" end="00:41:50.869" style="s2">and humility is a primary capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.869" end="00:41:52.069" style="s2">play game Blee well and as I&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.869" end="00:41:55.039" style="s2">to what you&#39;re saying one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.069" end="00:41:57.079" style="s2">that I remember is humility which is you</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.039" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">know hunting is a thing and it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.079" end="00:42:01.670" style="s2">richness and depth and complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:03.619" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to be able to read the you</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.670" end="00:42:05.779" style="s2">know the users guide on hunting and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.619" end="00:42:09.970" style="s2">jump into it and be a hunter it actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.779" end="00:42:12.310" style="s2">takes real-life capacity-building and</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.310" end="00:42:17.070" style="s2">in sight like this inside of humility</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.350" end="00:42:19.960" style="s2">and an increasing awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.070" end="00:42:21.700" style="s2">complexity is complex and I need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.960" end="00:42:23.650" style="s2">always be in relationship almost even</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.700" end="00:42:26.890" style="s2">beginning at humility before I step into</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.650" end="00:42:29.260" style="s2">anything so that I&#39;m able to be truly</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.890" end="00:42:30.730" style="s2">open to the full reality of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.260" end="00:42:32.980" style="s2">that I&#39;m about to do to myself into</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.730" end="00:42:34.930" style="s2">sorry so that&#39;s that yeah let me try</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.980" end="00:42:36.550" style="s2">summing up what you&#39;ve said so far and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.930" end="00:42:40.180" style="s2">you can tell me if I&#39;m full of or</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.550" end="00:42:42.790" style="s2">not or or closer or off which is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.180" end="00:42:45.340" style="s2">the answer to the question of at least</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.790" end="00:42:48.280" style="s2">an answer a beginning answer to how game</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.340" end="00:42:50.410" style="s2">B could beat game a despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.280" end="00:42:53.320" style="s2">that it&#39;s tiny today and game a is huge</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.410" end="00:42:56.080" style="s2">and powerful is that game a if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.320" end="00:42:59.890" style="s2">crafted correctly we&#39;ll do a better job</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.080" end="00:43:02.380" style="s2">of processing the world in a nonlinear</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.890" end="00:43:04.660" style="s2">high complexity fashion and even though</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.380" end="00:43:07.450" style="s2">it starts small it will have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.660" end="00:43:09.610" style="s2">exponent and those of us with a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.450" end="00:43:11.470" style="s2">bit of quantitative background know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.610" end="00:43:13.120" style="s2">over long enough period of time you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.470" end="00:43:14.740" style="s2">start mighty small and if you&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.120" end="00:43:16.810" style="s2">at a higher exponent you&#39;ll eventually</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.740" end="00:43:18.790" style="s2">beat the big guy who&#39;s growing at a low</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.810" end="00:43:21.160" style="s2">and growing in a broader sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.790" end="00:43:23.110" style="s2">solving the world&#39;s problems then then</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.160" end="00:43:24.490" style="s2">the bigger guys that getting something</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.110" end="00:43:27.730" style="s2">near the sense of what you were trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.490" end="00:43:29.500" style="s2">to communicate yep as prematures i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.730" end="00:43:30.250" style="s2">you may have started with game a but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.500" end="00:43:31.840" style="s2">became evident thing you definitely</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.250" end="00:43:33.430" style="s2">meant game B there and yes so that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.840" end="00:43:36.420" style="s2">be that okay and this is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.430" end="00:43:39.220" style="s2">the case when this rate versus state</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.420" end="00:43:42.610" style="s2">trade-off is so important you know so if</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.220" end="00:43:46.090" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a starting gate where the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.610" end="00:43:49.300" style="s2">ability to be able to do this innovation</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.090" end="00:43:50.650" style="s2">thing the raw material for doing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.300" end="00:43:52.150" style="s2">innovation that the adjacent populace</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.650" end="00:43:55.030" style="s2">the phase space of possibility is now</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.150" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">very very large and so the leverage of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.030" end="00:44:00.460" style="s2">increasing your capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:03.250" style="s2">innovation to to to move this the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.460" end="00:44:06.070" style="s2">adjacent possible is is very high you</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.250" end="00:44:08.830" style="s2">know so if we had tried to do this game</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.070" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">B thing in 1750 we couldn&#39;t have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.830" end="00:44:14.440" style="s2">there because there wasn&#39;t enough stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">in the space of possibility even if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.440" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">tried ruin EIN teen 50 we couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.900" style="s2">gotten there but but now we can&#39;t or at</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:21.580" style="s2">least at least in principle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.900" end="00:44:23.620" style="s2">possible that we can and so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.580" end="00:44:25.660" style="s2">this weird thing where almost exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.620" end="00:44:26.230" style="s2">the same characteristic that causes</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.660" end="00:44:27.790" style="s2">Gainey to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.230" end="00:44:30.490" style="s2">so challenging which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.790" end="00:44:32.740" style="s2">accelerating change happens to be the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.490" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">same exact characteristic that drives</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.740" end="00:44:37.750" style="s2">the possibility of game-based and we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:41.310" style="s2">exactly say that game B is just designed</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.750" end="00:44:44.710" style="s2">from the from the get-go to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.310" end="00:44:46.750" style="s2">substantially better at innovation than</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.710" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">game a and okay that&#39;s that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.750" end="00:44:49.330" style="s2">kind of simplify okay so we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:50.670" style="s2">do we&#39;re trying to figure out how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.330" end="00:44:53.590" style="s2">take a look at this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.670" end="00:44:55.300" style="s2">creative collaborations and how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.590" end="00:44:57.400" style="s2">that thing how do we design something</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.300" end="00:44:59.880" style="s2">which is just a whole lot better at</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.400" end="00:45:02.859" style="s2">creative collaboration recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.880" end="00:45:04.930" style="s2">we&#39;re now in a place where escape</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.859" end="00:45:06.580" style="s2">velocity through the innovation vector</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.930" end="00:45:08.350" style="s2">is available we might actually be able</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.580" end="00:45:10.690" style="s2">to do something was just so much better</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.350" end="00:45:13.290" style="s2">that it just lifts off let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.690" end="00:45:15.340" style="s2">the gaming right now has a million power</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.290" end="00:45:16.750" style="s2">and this is I&#39;m just gonna read in</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.340" end="00:45:18.810" style="s2">numbers just Rio to create what you just</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.750" end="00:45:22.390" style="s2">said now game gaming has a million power</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.810" end="00:45:24.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s rate of change is a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.390" end="00:45:25.869" style="s2">thousand per unit time and so the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.550" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">unit you know T plus one it&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.869" end="00:45:31.050" style="s2">a million one let&#39;s say game B right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:33.700" style="s2">is starting out at ten thousand power</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.050" end="00:45:36.550" style="s2">but its rate of change is actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.700" end="00:45:37.810" style="s2">something like compounding curve so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.550" end="00:45:41.230" style="s2">not a hundred thousand per unit time</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.810" end="00:45:43.210" style="s2">it&#39;s one point one times its current</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.230" end="00:45:45.310" style="s2">number and so it&#39;s gonna take a while</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.210" end="00:45:46.510" style="s2">for a while ten thousand times you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.310" end="00:45:48.130" style="s2">one point one is not getting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.510" end="00:45:49.660" style="s2">bigger but obviously if you just draw</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.130" end="00:45:51.400" style="s2">the curves there is a crossover point</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.660" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">and that crossover point by the way is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.400" end="00:45:56.440" style="s2">crossover point with wings because you</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.210" style="s2">know you&#39;ve crossed over and within a</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.440" end="00:46:00.520" style="s2">not very long time after you&#39;ve crossed</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.210" end="00:46:01.420" style="s2">over you&#39;ve blown right past and not</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.520" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">very long time after that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.420" end="00:46:04.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually gone so far past that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:07.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not even clear what the hell just</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.630" end="00:46:08.320" style="s2">happened and we can actually be in some</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.000" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">sense even very concrete about this I</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.320" end="00:46:13.630" style="s2">think it was an SSI book but maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.450" style="s2">wasn&#39;t taking him in the origin if well</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.630" end="00:46:18.100" style="s2">and there was a conversation about you</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.450" end="00:46:19.780" style="s2">know what it meant actually maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.100" end="00:46:21.550" style="s2">Matt Ridley&#39;s book where they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.780" end="00:46:26.230" style="s2">talking about like to have been lured</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.550" end="00:46:28.390" style="s2">xiv and you know in the one hand to have</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.390" end="00:46:33.400" style="s2">had a was massively massively better</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.760" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">than just being an average person and on</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.890" end="00:46:43.660" style="s2">example we have toothbrushes</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.120" end="00:46:45.670" style="s2">and obviously the telecommunications</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.660" end="00:46:48.070" style="s2">transportation air conditioning indoor</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.670" end="00:46:50.830" style="s2">plumbing antibiotics like</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.070" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">fill-in-the-blank and you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.830" end="00:46:57.880" style="s2">rate of innovation compared to the state</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">is one where we have all blown right by</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.880" end="00:47:02.380" style="s2">so if you imagine that you had a choice</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:04.360" style="s2">the lulu xiv was sitting there and hit</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.380" end="00:47:07.180" style="s2">her choice he could either ride train a</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.360" end="00:47:09.760" style="s2">where he gets to be lu xiv and gets me</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.180" end="00:47:13.960" style="s2">the top dog but train a has a particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.760" end="00:47:16.390" style="s2">rate of change or he gets on train b and</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.390" end="00:47:19.360" style="s2">longer gets to be lua the fourteenth it</p>

<p begin="00:47:25.990" end="00:47:31.090" style="s2">like man i really prefer to be lu xiv</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.910" end="00:47:32.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually a better choice if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.090" end="00:47:35.020" style="s2">like things like toothbrushes and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.560" end="00:47:36.550" style="s2">indoor plumbing and modern dentistry in</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.560" end="00:47:46.030" style="s2">right now a lot of the languaging is</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.050" end="00:47:48.010" style="s2">focused on stuff like technology like</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.190" end="00:47:56.230" style="s2">context of game B what we notice is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.080" end="00:47:58.890" style="s2">a large amount of the innovation field</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.230" end="00:48:03.090" style="s2">actually has to happen at the level of</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.590" end="00:48:24.220" style="s2">blow us up faster so we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:26.500" style="s2">do something and this is okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.220" end="00:48:27.670" style="s2">one of the reasons why I at least spend</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.500" end="00:48:29.890" style="s2">a lot of time thinking about it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.670" end="00:48:32.260" style="s2">of meta design and not in terms of just</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.890" end="00:48:34.060" style="s2">engineering if we&#39;re going to develop</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.260" end="00:48:36.460" style="s2">something which is just a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.060" end="00:48:38.410" style="s2">better at creative collaboration we</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.460" end="00:48:39.940" style="s2">actually notice from the very GetGo that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.410" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">we also have to design something that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.940" end="00:48:46.420" style="s2">a whole lot better at cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:48.470" style="s2">collective wisdom that is at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.420" end="00:48:51.320" style="s2">symmetric wit and probably is more</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.470" end="00:48:52.760" style="s2">superior to the power that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.320" end="00:48:55.970" style="s2">generating through this creative</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.760" end="00:48:59.420" style="s2">collaboration so like this is a meta</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.970" end="00:49:02.420" style="s2">design constraint yeah game be must must</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.420" end="00:49:03.050" style="s2">must orient its primary innovation</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.420" end="00:49:06.250" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.050" end="00:49:08.290" style="s2">first and foremost towards cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.250" end="00:49:11.300" style="s2">individual and collective sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.290" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">which is to say wisdom and maturity and</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.300" end="00:49:17.300" style="s2">a an awareness of how choices actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:19.310" style="s2">show up in the world more than the rate</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.300" end="00:49:21.140" style="s2">at which it increases individual</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.310" end="00:49:23.390" style="s2">collective power</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.140" end="00:49:25.250" style="s2">that makes a lot of sense it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.390" end="00:49:27.769" style="s2">two ways we could go here I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.250" end="00:49:29.900" style="s2">time to get more tangible yep a critique</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.769" end="00:49:32.539" style="s2">of game B is that it&#39;s too intangible</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.900" end="00:49:33.890" style="s2">too much stock not enough action and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.539" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">you know you and I have had an email</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.890" end="00:49:37.910" style="s2">conversation over the last few days</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:41.059" style="s2">talking a little bit about how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.910" end="00:49:42.890" style="s2">describe the phasing zuv game a and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.059" end="00:49:44.089" style="s2">some of the sub components might be and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.890" end="00:49:46.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of taken that a little further</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.089" end="00:49:48.349" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna be a game B game babe all</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.670" end="00:49:50.059" style="s2">right if I&#39;m saying something about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.349" end="00:49:51.980" style="s2">future its game B even if the game a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.059" end="00:49:54.460" style="s2">comes out of my mouth and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.980" end="00:49:56.750" style="s2">spend it extended it to a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.460" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">fairly tangible topics or so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.750" end="00:50:01.700" style="s2">to run through relatively rapidly so</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:05.000" style="s2">let&#39;s both try not to go down the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.700" end="00:50:06.890" style="s2">hole of digressions first we both agreed</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.000" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">that a reasonable way to present the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.890" end="00:50:11.480" style="s2">current state it we could call the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:13.940" style="s2">pregame be world or pre beef or short</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.480" end="00:50:17.240" style="s2">where there doesn&#39;t actually exist a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.940" end="00:50:20.180" style="s2">hole of a functioning game B group not</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.240" end="00:50:22.430" style="s2">even a small one but there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.180" end="00:50:26.299" style="s2">things that people are working on to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.430" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">ready for that first real step and first</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.299" end="00:50:30.470" style="s2">you called this out in 2017 finding the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:32.420" style="s2">others and that&#39;s starting to happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.470" end="00:50:34.519" style="s2">right through Twitter through Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.420" end="00:50:36.259" style="s2">through all traveling around the country</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.519" end="00:50:38.900" style="s2">and meeting to people and telling people</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.259" end="00:50:39.980" style="s2">about game B so let&#39;s let&#39;s let that one</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.900" end="00:50:41.450" style="s2">go because that one seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.980" end="00:50:43.460" style="s2">happening and though of course we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.450" end="00:50:45.289" style="s2">encourage any more listeners who think</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.460" end="00:50:47.299" style="s2">they would like to play game B to reach</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.289" end="00:50:48.980" style="s2">out to these connection points we talked</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.299" end="00:50:52.279" style="s2">about earlier the game B group on</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.980" end="00:50:54.680" style="s2">facebook and hashtag game B on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.279" end="00:50:56.240" style="s2">and find the others but then the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.680" end="00:50:58.490" style="s2">one I know you spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:51:00.440" style="s2">thinking about this and also started</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.490" end="00:51:03.650" style="s2">applying it to your own life is making</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.440" end="00:51:04.130" style="s2">changes in our lives to be more game B</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.650" end="00:51:06.500" style="s2">READY</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.130" end="00:51:09.769" style="s2">things like building courage and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.500" end="00:51:13.579" style="s2">optimism integrity honesty and good</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.769" end="00:51:15.349" style="s2">faith escaping the matrix of status</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.579" end="00:51:17.869" style="s2">oriented consumerism and being</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.349" end="00:51:20.180" style="s2">programmed by psychologically astute</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.869" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">mass and social media what are some</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.180" end="00:51:24.019" style="s2">other things in the in the changing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:27.500" style="s2">one&#39;s own own life that would you would</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.019" end="00:51:29.000" style="s2">say fit to this freebie world hmm well</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.500" end="00:51:31.400" style="s2">three things pop up immediately and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.000" end="00:51:33.390" style="s2">there I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re related so</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.400" end="00:51:35.940" style="s2">one is that I&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.390" end="00:51:36.690" style="s2">many people who come with a hey let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.940" end="00:51:40.560" style="s2">get going</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.690" end="00:51:42.750" style="s2">attitude have often not done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.560" end="00:51:46.140" style="s2">work on what I would call a transparent</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.750" end="00:51:49.170" style="s2">agentic mind and so there&#39;s a what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.140" end="00:51:50.850" style="s2">would call a naive assumption that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.170" end="00:51:53.340" style="s2">paradigm that they are very familiar</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.850" end="00:51:54.990" style="s2">with whatever it happens to be is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.340" end="00:51:55.980" style="s2">right paradigm and when it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.990" end="00:51:57.930" style="s2">happening of course is that then they</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.980" end="00:51:59.790" style="s2">reshape the story of game B into</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.930" end="00:52:01.380" style="s2">something that is a like their paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.790" end="00:52:03.450" style="s2">so one of the things is to actually take</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.380" end="00:52:05.970" style="s2">quite seriously this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.450" end="00:52:07.770" style="s2">liminality even down to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.970" end="00:52:10.380" style="s2">what I would call transparent agrammatic</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.770" end="00:52:12.690" style="s2">mind which is a real thing like that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.380" end="00:52:15.030" style="s2">not a trivial capacity to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.690" end="00:52:17.220" style="s2">the the axiomatic assumptions that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.030" end="00:52:19.170" style="s2">are bringing into your sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.220" end="00:52:22.920" style="s2">to be able to actually shift between</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.170" end="00:52:25.290" style="s2">different paradigms as the the arena</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.920" end="00:52:30.120" style="s2">that you&#39;re in changes so that&#39;s one two</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.290" end="00:52:33.570" style="s2">is building a capacity for orienting</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.120" end="00:52:36.090" style="s2">your choices on the basis of sense to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.570" end="00:52:39.390" style="s2">meaningfulness and these two things are</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.090" end="00:52:41.670" style="s2">actually very connected so in game a we</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.390" end="00:52:44.100" style="s2">have where we&#39;re very very separated</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.670" end="00:52:46.890" style="s2">from developmentally and socially</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.100" end="00:52:48.780" style="s2">separated from our capacity to orient</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.890" end="00:52:51.330" style="s2">our sense-making on the basis of sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.780" end="00:52:53.820" style="s2">of meaningfulness so for example we</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.330" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">spend more time on at work than</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.820" end="00:52:58.230" style="s2">with our kids and so something is off</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:52:59.790" style="s2">and yet we don&#39;t actually choose the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.230" end="00:53:01.380" style="s2">thing that if we were to spend real time</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.790" end="00:53:03.330" style="s2">on it is the more meaningful we</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.380" end="00:53:05.820" style="s2">rationalize and or just delude ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.330" end="00:53:07.590" style="s2">or ignore and that has to be broken like</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.820" end="00:53:10.980" style="s2">you cannot do game B because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.590" end="00:53:15.510" style="s2">primary piece of the capacity is this</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.980" end="00:53:18.300" style="s2">primordial or prefigured capacity in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.510" end="00:53:20.340" style="s2">human body to be able to just notice and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.300" end="00:53:22.740" style="s2">be able to be aware of what is more</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.340" end="00:53:24.270" style="s2">meaningful than other things just to you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.740" end="00:53:26.820" style="s2">like what feels more meaningful just</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.270" end="00:53:31.020" style="s2">that and being able to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.820" end="00:53:32.850" style="s2">really concrete self-discipline to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.020" end="00:53:36.270" style="s2">sure you&#39;ve got straight in order</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.850" end="00:53:38.100" style="s2">so if you&#39;re sacrificing that way if</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.270" end="00:53:39.900" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re there radically unaware</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.100" end="00:53:41.610" style="s2">of what is most meaningful fix that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.900" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">then if you are noticing that your</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.610" end="00:53:45.210" style="s2">choices aren&#39;t actually in accords with</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:47.190" style="s2">the values that you think you hold fix</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.210" end="00:53:49.079" style="s2">that and then notice</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.190" end="00:53:52.349" style="s2">what is the capacity in you that</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.079" end="00:53:54.630" style="s2">actually allows you to sense what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.349" end="00:53:56.099" style="s2">the what are the values that are going</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.630" end="00:53:57.480" style="s2">to orient towards meaningfulness what</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.099" end="00:53:59.099" style="s2">are the values that you hold what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.480" end="00:54:00.450" style="s2">sense that gives you that and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.099" end="00:54:03.240" style="s2">sense that allows you to use those</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.450" end="00:54:06.119" style="s2">values to actually notice what seemed</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.240" end="00:54:08.010" style="s2">like really good choices in in front of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.119" end="00:54:09.930" style="s2">you did you have to relearn a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.010" end="00:54:12.540" style="s2">machinery that was pounded out of you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.930" end="00:54:13.140" style="s2">largely by both education and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.540" end="00:54:16.109" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.140" end="00:54:17.819" style="s2">and being able to know in yourself what</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.109" end="00:54:19.140" style="s2">you actually care about and make choices</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.819" end="00:54:21.810" style="s2">in the business of what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.140" end="00:54:24.420" style="s2">important to you god that&#39;s so insane</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.810" end="00:54:25.829" style="s2">how hard that is because I find many</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.420" end="00:54:28.010" style="s2">many people are actually running</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.829" end="00:54:32.520" style="s2">ideologies which is to say that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.010" end="00:54:34.380" style="s2">they substitute somebody else&#39;s code</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.520" end="00:54:37.020" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s proposition for what is</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.380" end="00:54:39.270" style="s2">important in exchange for their own so</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.020" end="00:54:40.560" style="s2">instead of listening to my own sensing</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.270" end="00:54:43.740" style="s2">of what I actually care about</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.560" end="00:54:45.540" style="s2">I actually override myself in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.740" end="00:54:47.849" style="s2">some particular ideology that is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.540" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2">been able to impose itself on me as</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.849" end="00:54:54.569" style="s2">being more important and and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.060" end="00:54:56.520" style="s2">more more valuable than the values that</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.569" end="00:54:58.560" style="s2">my my whole self is are actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.520" end="00:55:00.810" style="s2">yearning for that that&#39;s a piece it has</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.560" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">to be done let me throw in a tangible</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.810" end="00:55:03.800" style="s2">you know you know me I like the tangible</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:05.910" style="s2">you know to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.800" end="00:55:07.980" style="s2">introduction piece I said you know we</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.910" end="00:55:10.619" style="s2">need to deprogram ourselves from status</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.980" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">oriented consumption so person thinks</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.619" end="00:55:15.869" style="s2">they need to have a fancy BMW to be who</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:17.700" style="s2">they are and therefore they have to take</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.869" end="00:55:19.890" style="s2">a high-pressure job with a 90 minute</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.700" end="00:55:22.319" style="s2">commute hmm so that they can afford this</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.890" end="00:55:24.329" style="s2">BMW the result is they&#39;re not gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.319" end="00:55:26.670" style="s2">the time to spend with their children or</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.329" end="00:55:29.220" style="s2">their spouse or their friends and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.670" end="00:55:31.530" style="s2">they have taken this ideology which</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.220" end="00:55:34.920" style="s2">programmed into them by psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.530" end="00:55:37.800" style="s2">astute media and advertising and have</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.920" end="00:55:40.530" style="s2">inserted that instead of their actual</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.800" end="00:55:41.880" style="s2">really meaningful goals yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.530" end="00:55:43.230" style="s2">and you can see that happening in all</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.880" end="00:55:45.960" style="s2">kinds of interesting ways but for</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.230" end="00:55:49.140" style="s2">example rather than you know hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.960" end="00:55:51.119" style="s2">with friends and family they go to a you</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.140" end="00:55:53.040" style="s2">know an upwardly mobile business meeting</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.119" end="00:55:54.690" style="s2">with people that they have very little</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.040" end="00:55:56.099" style="s2">sense of actual connection with because</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.690" end="00:55:57.420" style="s2">in the back of their mind they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.099" end="00:55:59.339" style="s2">even like the jobs that they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.420" end="00:56:01.260" style="s2">right just you got this huge explosion</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.339" end="00:56:01.700" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about is if</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.260" end="00:56:03.860" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.700" end="00:56:06.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a synergy value that shows up</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.860" end="00:56:08.840" style="s2">because the way I&#39;m describing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.890" end="00:56:10.910" style="s2">kind of like freeing your mind and</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.840" end="00:56:12.920" style="s2">increasing a capacity to make more</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.910" end="00:56:15.290" style="s2">meaningful choices but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.920" end="00:56:16.790" style="s2">it&#39;s also freeing your economy because</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.290" end="00:56:20.120" style="s2">if you&#39;re not addicted to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.790" end="00:56:21.770" style="s2">particular vector of status consumption</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.120" end="00:56:24.470" style="s2">you&#39;re obviously not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.770" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">dependent on as much of a flow of money</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.470" end="00:56:29.300" style="s2">and this gives you a lot more actual</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.540" end="00:56:31.850" style="s2">freedom exactly and you know at least in</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.300" end="00:56:34.730" style="s2">my mind I strongly suspect that one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.850" end="00:56:36.740" style="s2">the roads to getting ready for game B is</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.730" end="00:56:39.350" style="s2">to get one&#39;s financial life in order and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.740" end="00:56:41.300" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean making more money it</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.350" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">may well mean just spending less less</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.300" end="00:56:47.420" style="s2">less having your buttons pushed to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:48.980" style="s2">you think you need x y&amp;z right right</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.420" end="00:56:50.540" style="s2">let&#39;s go side bar here I have it way</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.980" end="00:56:52.490" style="s2">down my list but you&#39;ve mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.540" end="00:56:54.950" style="s2">several times now and frankly I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.490" end="00:56:57.650" style="s2">entirely clear what you mean by it so</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.950" end="00:56:59.500" style="s2">I&#39;d love for you to take a five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.650" end="00:57:03.020" style="s2">no longer I&#39;m gonna blow the whistle on</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.500" end="00:57:06.740" style="s2">meaning what does meaning mean and what</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.020" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">is it to be meaning full five minutes on</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.740" end="00:57:11.810" style="s2">meaningfulness five minutes so now I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.160" end="00:57:15.110" style="s2">rely on old-school skills and do a</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.190" end="00:57:22.730" style="s2">from the meaning crisis go watch that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.110" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">you will then have a much better sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.730" end="00:57:29.270" style="s2">of what that means but to say John has a</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:31.060" style="s2">good framework so I&#39;ll use that as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.270" end="00:57:33.730" style="s2">as I can for ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.060" end="00:57:36.260" style="s2">propositional procedural perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.730" end="00:57:37.940" style="s2">participatory and and they&#39;re in a stack</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.260" end="00:57:42.260" style="s2">which is say the participatory is more</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.940" end="00:57:44.330" style="s2">fundamental and propositional is more</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.260" end="00:57:45.740" style="s2">rapidly changeable you can you can move</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.330" end="00:57:46.550" style="s2">propositions around faster opposition</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.740" end="00:57:48.590" style="s2">was like what we&#39;re doing right now</p>

<p begin="00:57:48.590" end="00:57:52.100" style="s2">you&#39;re absorbing language to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.390" end="00:57:55.050" style="s2">you&#39;re moving your ideas around in</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.100" end="00:57:57.300" style="s2">relationship to what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.050" end="00:58:01.140" style="s2">anticipatory has to do with it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.300" end="00:58:03.510" style="s2">like the the fitness of your way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.140" end="00:58:04.760" style="s2">being in relationship to the world that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.510" end="00:58:08.070" style="s2">you&#39;re in so if you actually use just</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.760" end="00:58:10.830" style="s2">evolutionary Fitness and extend that to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.070" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">include the whole way that a human can</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.830" end="00:58:13.890" style="s2">be in relationship with with the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:16.980" style="s2">kinds of Nicias that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.890" end="00:58:18.150" style="s2">in that&#39;s where meaningfulness comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.980" end="00:58:20.240" style="s2">from that is meaningfulness so</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.150" end="00:58:23.400" style="s2">meaningfulness has to do with the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.240" end="00:58:25.110" style="s2">wholeness of your entire mode of being</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.400" end="00:58:28.440" style="s2">in the world all the different ways that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.110" end="00:58:31.140" style="s2">you respond to what is coming at you</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.440" end="00:58:34.740" style="s2">that gives rise to your increasing</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.140" end="00:58:35.070" style="s2">capacity to respond well to what is in</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.740" end="00:58:37.440" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.070" end="00:58:40.020" style="s2">so meaningfulness is simultaneous that</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.440" end="00:58:41.130" style="s2">the means to the end of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.020" end="00:58:44.160" style="s2">respond to the world in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.130" end="00:58:46.680" style="s2">furthers your capacity to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.160" end="00:58:50.910" style="s2">world in the next moment of time you you</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.680" end="00:58:53.970" style="s2">are fit in that sense and also it is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.910" end="00:58:57.000" style="s2">the capacity in yourself of how you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.970" end="00:59:01.530" style="s2">sense what kinds of changes in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.000" end="00:59:04.020" style="s2">are more affordance to increasing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.530" end="00:59:06.540" style="s2">capacity does that make sense almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.020" end="00:59:08.760" style="s2">what exactly is the capacity let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.540" end="00:59:10.580" style="s2">that clear the language I think has</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.760" end="00:59:13.500" style="s2">patinas talked about the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.580" end="00:59:16.890" style="s2">conformation to conform so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.500" end="00:59:18.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a pistol let&#39;s do that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.890" end="00:59:20.880" style="s2">pistol in front of me it&#39;s a Glock</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.780" end="00:59:22.500" style="s2">actually and so what I noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.880" end="00:59:24.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a way for my hand to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.500" end="00:59:25.950" style="s2">configured so that my hand is holding</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.450" end="00:59:27.270" style="s2">this Glock in a way that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.950" end="00:59:28.350" style="s2">able to pull the trigger effectively</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.270" end="00:59:30.330" style="s2">does that make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.350" end="00:59:31.950" style="s2">that is in a very large number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.330" end="00:59:33.720" style="s2">that my hand can be conformed that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.950" end="00:59:34.910" style="s2">in conformity with with the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.720" end="00:59:38.730" style="s2">affordance of the pistol</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.910" end="00:59:41.550" style="s2">so meaningfulness is simultaneously on</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.730" end="00:59:43.200" style="s2">the one hand the practical which is if I</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.550" end="00:59:44.460" style="s2">get my hand in the right conformity to</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.200" end="00:59:45.780" style="s2">the pistol I can actually pull the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.460" end="00:59:47.700" style="s2">trigger in fact if I get it my whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.780" end="00:59:49.290" style="s2">body in the right relationship with that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.700" end="00:59:51.270" style="s2">with the affordance of the pistol I can</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.290" end="00:59:52.980" style="s2">actually shoot with accuracy and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.270" end="00:59:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s meaningfulness from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.980" end="00:59:58.190" style="s2">view of effectiveness in in world in</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.470" end="00:59:59.120" style="s2">relationship to it the world does offer</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.190" end="01:00:01.160" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.120" end="01:00:03.230" style="s2">meaningfulness which is the how do I go</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.160" end="01:00:04.910" style="s2">about figuring that out well what I</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.230" end="01:00:06.080" style="s2">notice is that if I sort of experiment</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.910" end="01:00:07.490" style="s2">with it there&#39;s something about the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.080" end="01:00:08.810" style="s2">that I knew I&#39;m holding the gun upside</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.490" end="01:00:11.030" style="s2">down and I&#39;ve got like all my fingers</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.810" end="01:00:12.740" style="s2">stuck together like a submit there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.030" end="01:00:14.600" style="s2">something in me that is telling me that</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.740" end="01:00:16.730" style="s2">that ain&#39;t the right way and so the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.600" end="01:00:19.850" style="s2">sense of meaningfulness is the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.730" end="01:00:21.650" style="s2">to be able to discern in reality in this</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.510" end="01:00:27.680" style="s2">my capacity as a body relate to those</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:33.500" style="s2">to conform to that so as to increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.050" end="01:00:35.780" style="s2">realise a capacity to be an effective</p>

<p begin="01:00:40.940" end="01:00:47.810" style="s2">is figuring out yes figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.360" end="01:00:49.250" style="s2">how to actually live in life well which</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.810" end="01:00:52.550" style="s2">is to say by well what I mean is not</p>

<p begin="01:00:52.550" end="01:00:57.620" style="s2">right this this double order I have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.890" end="01:00:58.940" style="s2">be able to be in effective relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.620" end="01:01:01.070" style="s2">with what the world is throwing at me</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.940" end="01:01:03.710" style="s2">now but by effective relationship what I</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.070" end="01:01:06.080" style="s2">mean is that what I do how I how I</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.710" end="01:01:07.760" style="s2">actually show up increases my</p>

<p begin="01:01:10.550" end="01:01:15.620" style="s2">that&#39;s it okay I&#39;m gonna push back a</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.640" end="01:01:17.420" style="s2">little bit one could argue that in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.620" end="01:01:20.300" style="s2">current world that would say to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.420" end="01:01:22.430" style="s2">meaningful is to become a very good game</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.300" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">a player well</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.430" end="01:01:29.090" style="s2">if game a was in fact a really valid</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:30.860" style="s2">future then that would be true and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.090" end="01:01:33.290" style="s2">was at some point so there was a time</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.860" end="01:01:35.360" style="s2">that being meaningful was figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.290" end="01:01:37.370" style="s2">what are the affordances of game a</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.360" end="01:01:39.860" style="s2">getting damn good at it for a period of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.370" end="01:01:41.030" style="s2">time that was very true and this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.860" end="01:01:42.500" style="s2">actually quite challenging because</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.030" end="01:01:43.580" style="s2">remember I said and this is I think this</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.500" end="01:01:46.130" style="s2">is actually a very interesting piece</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.580" end="01:01:47.810" style="s2">when I said the game be is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.130" end="01:01:49.970" style="s2">omnipresent but we may be playing it at</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.810" end="01:01:53.480" style="s2">a level zero I mean that quite seriously</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.970" end="01:01:57.550" style="s2">I mean that like 35,000 years ago game B</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.480" end="01:01:59.630" style="s2">was present but game a and game B are</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.550" end="01:02:01.400" style="s2">co-present and so there&#39;s this really</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.630" end="01:02:03.920" style="s2">interesting tension that we can feel in</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.400" end="01:02:05.150" style="s2">ourselves that as we sort of follow the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.920" end="01:02:09.230" style="s2">meaningfulness vector in the direction</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.150" end="01:02:11.010" style="s2">of game a we can notice a tension or a</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.230" end="01:02:13.050" style="s2">lack of integrity a fragment</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.010" end="01:02:14.220" style="s2">tation of ourselves in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.050" end="01:02:16.310" style="s2">the meaningful inspector in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.220" end="01:02:19.230" style="s2">direction of gain be because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.310" end="01:02:21.630" style="s2">discontinuity between the two and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.230" end="01:02:25.230" style="s2">think that is is really really a deep</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.630" end="01:02:27.900" style="s2">point like it it speaks to why we may</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.230" end="01:02:29.460" style="s2">have a subjective sense of the is</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.900" end="01:02:31.830" style="s2">rut talking about or what is Paul</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.460" end="01:02:34.590" style="s2">talking about when he says that to play</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.830" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">game a well was meaningfulness in say</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.590" end="01:02:40.290" style="s2">the 1950s or say the 1300s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:41.940" style="s2">because in the end the larger scheme of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.290" end="01:02:43.980" style="s2">things right we&#39;ve been doing this this</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.940" end="01:02:46.170" style="s2">human thing for a million years and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.980" end="01:02:48.600" style="s2">the 35,000 years where game a was a</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.170" end="01:02:50.760" style="s2">certain had a certain conformity to it</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.600" end="01:02:53.010" style="s2">it&#39;s just a blink of the eye so we might</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.760" end="01:02:55.620" style="s2">say is that our deep deep deep sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.010" end="01:02:58.760" style="s2">meaningfulness has kind of always felt</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.620" end="01:03:02.370" style="s2">the game a has this this taste of</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.760" end="01:03:05.160" style="s2">short-termism a taste of I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.370" end="01:03:06.510" style="s2">trade-offs between things and maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.160" end="01:03:07.800" style="s2">are the right trade-offs anyway I have</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.510" end="01:03:09.570" style="s2">to make those trade-offs I want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.800" end="01:03:11.460" style="s2">continue to be able to play the game but</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.570" end="01:03:13.740" style="s2">I also feel a certain wrongness to it</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.460" end="01:03:16.700" style="s2">and so one of the things we might say is</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.740" end="01:03:20.070" style="s2">that the fulfillment of game B is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.700" end="01:03:22.020" style="s2">recovery of that and moving back into an</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.070" end="01:03:25.110" style="s2">alignment that the that even our</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.020" end="01:03:28.050" style="s2">evolutionary selves can feel is a hoof</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.110" end="01:03:29.520" style="s2">now I no longer have to in order to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.050" end="01:03:32.040" style="s2">pursue this path of what is actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.520" end="01:03:34.620" style="s2">meaningful I can actually pursue a path</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.040" end="01:03:36.660" style="s2">that is feeling increasingly meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.620" end="01:03:39.290" style="s2">all the way down and all the way out</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.660" end="01:03:41.820" style="s2">which is a very nice orientation</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.290" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">essentially you talk about the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.820" end="01:03:46.500" style="s2">wrongness that keeps popping up and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.640" end="01:03:47.970" style="s2">give two good examples that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.500" end="01:03:51.300" style="s2">actually pretty major and had some</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.970" end="01:03:54.540" style="s2">result in game a and and twice challenge</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.300" end="01:03:56.910" style="s2">game a one is Marx&#39;s idea of alienation</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.540" end="01:03:59.310" style="s2">you know the idea that the ever</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.910" end="01:04:01.530" style="s2">crunching machinery of capitalism all</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.310" end="01:04:04.680" style="s2">delivers the productive goods at least</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.530" end="01:04:07.020" style="s2">for many people alienates people from a</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.680" end="01:04:09.990" style="s2">holistic approach to life and work and</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.020" end="01:04:12.600" style="s2">he predicted would eventually realize</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.990" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">that they were alienated and revolt and</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.600" end="01:04:17.340" style="s2">in reality it turned out game a was good</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:19.860" style="s2">enough at buying them out off from their</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.340" end="01:04:22.620" style="s2">alienation that their they had been in</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.860" end="01:04:24.539" style="s2">so far willing to remain alienated the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.620" end="01:04:27.150" style="s2">second I think closely related</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.539" end="01:04:29.459" style="s2">concept again a sense of wrongness was</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.150" end="01:04:31.859" style="s2">from the 60s caught the hippie movement</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.459" end="01:04:33.739" style="s2">or whatever whatever it was was going on</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.859" end="01:04:37.169" style="s2">in the 60s the word there was</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.739" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">inauthenticity that people were walking</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.169" end="01:04:40.619" style="s2">away from and you know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:43.019" style="s2">have about my age especially once it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.619" end="01:04:45.329" style="s2">little teeny bit older got decent</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.019" end="01:04:47.819" style="s2">college education and walked away and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.329" end="01:04:50.729" style="s2">built hippie commune so to speak to try</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.819" end="01:04:52.769" style="s2">to achieve more authenticity in their</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.729" end="01:04:54.359" style="s2">life you know the feeling that you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.769" end="01:04:56.209" style="s2">putting on the gray flannel suit and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.359" end="01:04:59.489" style="s2">going to work and the big bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.209" end="01:05:02.279" style="s2">behemoths was not an authentic way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.489" end="01:05:05.009" style="s2">honoring our being as creatures in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.279" end="01:05:07.049" style="s2">world yeah those both Sordi I think get</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.009" end="01:05:08.489" style="s2">it your sense absolutely and we can say</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.049" end="01:05:10.169" style="s2">that you know one of the words that I</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.489" end="01:05:11.489" style="s2">think rings very nicely now in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.169" end="01:05:14.880" style="s2">context of meaningfulness as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.489" end="01:05:16.859" style="s2">described it is integrity and here</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:17.999" style="s2">integrity has a lot of like Landsman</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.859" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">quite nice and we think about it like</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.999" end="01:05:23.729" style="s2">structural integrity which is to say</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:26.089" style="s2">that all of the pieces are fitting</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.729" end="01:05:28.439" style="s2">together well so alienation is</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.089" end="01:05:29.489" style="s2">fragmentation where okay I&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.439" end="01:05:30.630" style="s2">pieces that are fitting together well</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.489" end="01:05:32.249" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole other bunch of pieces</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.630" end="01:05:34.709" style="s2">that are not and that Suellen asian is</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.249" end="01:05:38.009" style="s2">right and in authenticity is kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.709" end="01:05:39.630" style="s2">same thing and so in this perspective we</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.009" end="01:05:42.209" style="s2">can look at it from a meta meta level</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.630" end="01:05:44.729" style="s2">like oh wow so the orientation towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.209" end="01:05:47.609" style="s2">meaningfulness includes within itself an</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.729" end="01:05:50.219" style="s2">awareness of all the different pieces of</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.609" end="01:05:52.499" style="s2">myself and in fact by the way of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.219" end="01:05:54.329" style="s2">whole world that are not in integrity</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.499" end="01:05:57.029" style="s2">they are not in right relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.329" end="01:06:00.630" style="s2">each other and by the way therefore have</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.029" end="01:06:02.400" style="s2">less structural integrity so as we begin</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.630" end="01:06:04.049" style="s2">to be aware of this work okay yeah those</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.400" end="01:06:06.239" style="s2">guys were picking things up and by the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.049" end="01:06:08.069" style="s2">way we can run back in time and see this</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.239" end="01:06:11.279" style="s2">happening all the time like constantly</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.069" end="01:06:13.919" style="s2">we were noticing that the trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.279" end="01:06:15.929" style="s2">that we were forced to make by the</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.919" end="01:06:17.459" style="s2">reality of the world that we were in and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.929" end="01:06:19.409" style="s2">you know that&#39;s just been the reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.459" end="01:06:20.819" style="s2">whether it was the trade-off of which of</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.409" end="01:06:22.799" style="s2">your children dies because you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.819" end="01:06:24.719" style="s2">got enough food or the reality of your</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.799" end="01:06:26.099" style="s2">going to kill that other sentient human</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.719" end="01:06:29.369" style="s2">being because you&#39;re a war whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.099" end="01:06:31.529" style="s2">is is a separation from a larger</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.369" end="01:06:33.870" style="s2">integrity a larger movement of</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.529" end="01:06:36.210" style="s2">meaningfulness that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.870" end="01:06:37.980" style="s2">subject to the contingencies of now but</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.210" end="01:06:42.540" style="s2">we feel in ourselves of wrongness to it</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.980" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s like a pragmatic acceptance now</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.540" end="01:06:47.280" style="s2">I&#39;m saying okay we&#39;re going to be very</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:48.750" style="s2">aware of how do we move more and more in</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.280" end="01:06:52.040" style="s2">that direction of a greater and greater</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.750" end="01:06:54.030" style="s2">rightness non utopian right I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.040" end="01:06:55.890" style="s2">proposing and by any stretch of the</p>

<p begin="01:06:55.890" end="01:07:00.600" style="s2">be able to teleport from here to there</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.080" end="01:07:03.030" style="s2">we have to actually grow our capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.600" end="01:07:05.540" style="s2">include more and more of ourselves and</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.030" end="01:07:08.940" style="s2">the world in this meaningfulness and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.540" end="01:07:10.200" style="s2">also non utopian in the sense of there</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.940" end="01:07:12.750" style="s2">is no end point where there&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.200" end="01:07:14.430" style="s2">ongoing nosov an increasing capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.750" end="01:07:16.350" style="s2">include more and more of ourselves and</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.430" end="01:07:18.420" style="s2">other people and the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.350" end="01:07:21.120" style="s2">in something that has deeper and</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.420" end="01:07:23.340" style="s2">stronger and richer integrity all right</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.120" end="01:07:25.350" style="s2">it&#39;s 11 minutes not bad for Jim and</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.340" end="01:07:25.770" style="s2">Jordan trying to talk about meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.350" end="01:07:27.840" style="s2">and asked</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.770" end="01:07:30.690" style="s2">let&#39;s now ratchet down a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.840" end="01:07:32.430" style="s2">into the tangible in our pregame be</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.690" end="01:07:34.890" style="s2">world one of the other pieces that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.430" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">agreed is very important I think you</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.890" end="01:07:39.420" style="s2">called it transition I decided to rename</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:41.700" style="s2">it experimenting with the piece parts</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.420" end="01:07:44.190" style="s2">you know game B is going to have a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.700" end="01:07:45.990" style="s2">of things that have to be solved for it</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.190" end="01:07:49.530" style="s2">to be holistic it to be able to create</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.990" end="01:07:51.930" style="s2">the first whole game B and it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.530" end="01:07:55.200" style="s2">me that you know game B is gonna have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.930" end="01:07:56.640" style="s2">think about design find I think we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:07:58.050" style="s2">we don&#39;t have time to design everything</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:07:59.730" style="s2">we have to find some existing things</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.050" end="01:08:02.370" style="s2">that work or can be modified a little</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.730" end="01:08:04.080" style="s2">bit and a whole bunch of domains and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.370" end="01:08:06.090" style="s2">gonna run through a couple ease domains</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.080" end="01:08:08.670" style="s2">and see if you can just say a few things</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.090" end="01:08:10.380" style="s2">about them and we can move on Akai got</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.670" end="01:08:12.150" style="s2">15 when we run out of time I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.380" end="01:08:13.500" style="s2">stop but before you go down the line let</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.150" end="01:08:15.210" style="s2">me just put a little bit of a frame on</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.500" end="01:08:16.530" style="s2">that a little bit more color on the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.210" end="01:08:18.540" style="s2">space of transition because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.530" end="01:08:21.180" style="s2">three characteristics that I think are</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.540" end="01:08:23.670" style="s2">important to think about so one</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.180" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">characteristic is this this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.670" end="01:08:27.150" style="s2">the adjacent possible so if you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:30.590" style="s2">think about it through the metaphor of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.150" end="01:08:34.410" style="s2">series of steps if the thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.590" end="01:08:36.780" style="s2">metastable in game B is three steps away</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.410" end="01:08:37.920" style="s2">the transition is to say well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.780" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">actually going to have to go through</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.920" end="01:08:42.510" style="s2">step two one and two before we get to</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.560" end="01:08:43.680" style="s2">three and you know gets it serene unless</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.510" end="01:08:45.210" style="s2">you go through one and two so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.680" end="01:08:47.500" style="s2">actually very important to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.210" end="01:08:49.480" style="s2">that there are things that need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.500" end="01:08:51.670" style="s2">change from where we are now that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.480" end="01:08:53.770" style="s2">not the end State or at least are not</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.670" end="01:08:55.690" style="s2">the game be piece of it but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.770" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">are actually necessary for us to get</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.690" end="01:08:59.890" style="s2">there that&#39;s one side another piece of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:02.680" style="s2">transition is the kind of like the the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.890" end="01:09:06.850" style="s2">Noah&#39;s Ark piece or the the lifeboat</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.680" end="01:09:08.950" style="s2">which is we humans we individuals and we</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.850" end="01:09:10.180" style="s2">as a species have to make it so it</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.950" end="01:09:12.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do us any good if we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.180" end="01:09:13.509" style="s2">really cool design document for a game</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.130" end="01:09:16.150" style="s2">be it looks like and nobody makes it it</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.509" end="01:09:17.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do you any good if you and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.150" end="01:09:19.480" style="s2">things that you care about don&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.470" end="01:09:20.950" style="s2">so another part of the transition is how</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.480" end="01:09:23.529" style="s2">do you create what we call back in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.950" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">day zones of cultivated security so that</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.529" end="01:09:29.100" style="s2">as we&#39;re moving forward into this effort</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:31.779" style="s2">to get to a place we&#39;re calling game be</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.100" end="01:09:33.880" style="s2">we and as much of what we care about</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.779" end="01:09:35.589" style="s2">make it into that place so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.880" end="01:09:36.940" style="s2">another piece of the transition story</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.589" end="01:09:37.990" style="s2">and then the third piece is the one that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.940" end="01:09:39.609" style="s2">you mentioned which is to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.990" end="01:09:42.339" style="s2">experimenting with the piece parts</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.609" end="01:09:43.240" style="s2">really recognizing that in many cases we</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.339" end="01:09:45.460" style="s2">really don&#39;t know how to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.240" end="01:09:47.380" style="s2">this stuff and we have to start learning</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.460" end="01:09:48.940" style="s2">all right now and they&#39;re all tied</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.380" end="01:09:50.620" style="s2">together you can&#39;t build the zone of</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.940" end="01:09:52.210" style="s2">security until you have pieced parts</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.620" end="01:09:54.490" style="s2">that were core right and that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.210" end="01:09:56.590" style="s2">toxic side effects and if we look at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.490" end="01:09:59.830" style="s2">history of people trying to build for</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.590" end="01:10:02.500" style="s2">instance intentional communities almost</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.830" end="01:10:04.810" style="s2">always they&#39;ve failed due to bad design</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.500" end="01:10:06.610" style="s2">or lack of understanding of human nature</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.810" end="01:10:09.460" style="s2">so there&#39;s these things are not linear</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.610" end="01:10:11.590" style="s2">these are all non linearly interrelated</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.460" end="01:10:13.030" style="s2">anyway let me hop down start down the</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.590" end="01:10:15.730" style="s2">list a bit I probably will stop after I</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.030" end="01:10:17.800" style="s2">get through a few of them parenting what</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.730" end="01:10:20.290" style="s2">this game be have to think about how</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.800" end="01:10:22.630" style="s2">children are raised Wow how they relate</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.290" end="01:10:24.460" style="s2">to their parents and how spouses relate</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.630" end="01:10:25.390" style="s2">to each other all right so here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.460" end="01:10:27.730" style="s2">here&#39;s what I think is probably the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.390" end="01:10:29.380" style="s2">easiest piece so I&#39;m gonna play a game</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.730" end="01:10:30.520" style="s2">where I&#39;m just gonna try to say the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.380" end="01:10:32.290" style="s2">thing that I think is the most</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.520" end="01:10:35.170" style="s2">fundamental and not do a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.290" end="01:10:37.060" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot great so if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.170" end="01:10:38.850" style="s2">have an intuitive sense that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.060" end="01:10:44.230" style="s2">relationship between parent and child</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.850" end="01:10:45.400" style="s2">has a strong fundamental asymmetry like</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.230" end="01:10:46.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.400" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">master and student or its own</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.900" end="01:10:51.370" style="s2">relationship between boss and employee</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.480" end="01:10:54.100" style="s2">then game be would would will have some</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.370" end="01:10:57.550" style="s2">surprises for you that within the game</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.100" end="01:11:00.670" style="s2">be context there remember humility is</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.550" end="01:11:03.730" style="s2">super important there is a deep D</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.670" end="01:11:06.670" style="s2">awareness of the degree to which really</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.730" end="01:11:08.469" style="s2">effective parenting has a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.670" end="01:11:10.150" style="s2">symmetry which is to say and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.469" end="01:11:11.350" style="s2">way that I&#39;ve set it to people and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.150" end="01:11:13.570" style="s2">have a one-year-old daughter so this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.350" end="01:11:18.429" style="s2">like very concrete for me I am aware</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.570" end="01:11:21.400" style="s2">that she is a fully realized soul at</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.429" end="01:11:24.690" style="s2">least as rich and fully realized as I</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.400" end="01:11:27.820" style="s2">write as a human being we are equal I</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.690" end="01:11:29.650" style="s2">happen to have been in a body that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.820" end="01:11:31.090" style="s2">gone around the Sun many more times than</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.650" end="01:11:32.380" style="s2">her particular body so when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.090" end="01:11:34.000" style="s2">a lot of the kinds of things that have</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.380" end="01:11:36.310" style="s2">to do with how bodies maneuver ends time</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.000" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">and space I&#39;ve got a lot more experience</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.310" end="01:11:41.260" style="s2">and so I play a particular role of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:44.199" style="s2">symmetry in terms of supporting her</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.260" end="01:11:45.489" style="s2">building the capacity in herself to</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.199" end="01:11:47.050" style="s2">become more capable of being in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.489" end="01:11:48.310" style="s2">world and noticed by the way what I said</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.050" end="01:11:49.890" style="s2">- I said supporting her and building the</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.310" end="01:11:52.270" style="s2">capacity in herself I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.890" end="01:11:54.429" style="s2">impressing the things that I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.270" end="01:11:55.870" style="s2">on her propositional ease top down</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.429" end="01:11:57.730" style="s2">because that gets in the way that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.870" end="01:11:59.199" style="s2">a teacher a bad teacher does to a</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.730" end="01:12:00.670" style="s2">student you&#39;re not learning how to</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.199" end="01:12:04.390" style="s2">finish I&#39;m just giving you the fish in</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.670" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">this metaphor but at the same time I</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.390" end="01:12:08.340" style="s2">certainly have noticed that in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:10.810" style="s2">my own developmental journey my own</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.340" end="01:12:13.840" style="s2">building of integrity of myself and my</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.810" end="01:12:16.060" style="s2">own learning and growing she has as much</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.840" end="01:12:17.890" style="s2">to teach me in terms of like liminality</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.060" end="01:12:19.239" style="s2">she&#39;s the master of liminality because</p>

<p begin="01:12:19.239" end="01:12:23.170" style="s2">mind to reality and so if I look at that</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.880" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2">and say wow so what&#39;s really happening</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.170" end="01:12:27.910" style="s2">here is that we are teaching each other</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:30.340" style="s2">this question of meaningfulness and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.910" end="01:12:33.420" style="s2">opening myself up to the possibility of</p>

<p begin="01:12:39.010" end="01:12:44.590" style="s2">her and we are now peers collaborating</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.890" end="01:12:47.530" style="s2">in this crazy show of parenting</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.590" end="01:12:48.730" style="s2">child&#39;s family and reality that&#39;s a game</p>

<p begin="01:12:48.730" end="01:12:55.510" style="s2">cool let&#39;s go on to the next one making</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.370" end="01:12:58.150" style="s2">a living and this is a fun game it feels</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.510" end="01:12:59.650" style="s2">like a 50s game show alright so we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.150" end="01:13:02.110" style="s2">a couple of different things here and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.650" end="01:13:04.270" style="s2">for me it has this it&#39;s like a double</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.110" end="01:13:05.290" style="s2">loop so so one loop is that what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.270" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">like to put out there it says good</p>

<p begin="01:13:19.540" end="01:13:22.960" style="s2">game B thing because remember if we if</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.250" end="01:13:25.870" style="s2">we propose that we&#39;re engaging in hyper</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.960" end="01:13:28.170" style="s2">collaboration each of us has some piece</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.870" end="01:13:31.780" style="s2">that is the piece that we are ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.170" end="01:13:33.489" style="s2">responsible for and we can invoke kind</p>

<p begin="01:13:50.230" end="01:13:53.739" style="s2">lights up and you feel like becoming</p>

<p begin="01:14:12.280" end="01:14:15.070" style="s2">Livelihood this is how you actually play</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.780" end="01:14:17.860" style="s2">the role that is yours to play in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.070" end="01:14:20.560" style="s2">context of game B and then we can notice</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.860" end="01:14:24.429" style="s2">in that that we then have the subsidiary</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.560" end="01:14:25.750" style="s2">challenge of how do I make how to accrue</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.429" end="01:14:27.730" style="s2">to myself the resources that are</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.750" end="01:14:31.630" style="s2">necessary to be able to continue to live</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.730" end="01:14:33.130" style="s2">while I am pursuing that vocation we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.630" end="01:14:36.820" style="s2">talk a lot about that but I&#39;ll stop her</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.130" end="01:14:39.310" style="s2">there okay next and this is a word which</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.820" end="01:14:42.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve probably known since I was 15 but I</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.310" end="01:14:44.110" style="s2">see coming at it from many different</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.190" end="01:14:46.900" style="s2">directions and I&#39;ve now come to believe</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.110" end="01:14:49.920" style="s2">this is goddamn near the key to making</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.900" end="01:14:51.070" style="s2">game B happen and that is conviviality</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.920" end="01:14:53.140" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.070" end="01:14:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a beautiful word isn&#39;t it it</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.140" end="01:14:56.050" style="s2">really is might we start I probably not</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.880" end="01:14:58.179" style="s2">a word known to everybody why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.050" end="01:15:00.460" style="s2">start by defining conviviality and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.179" end="01:15:02.670" style="s2">explain how do we make that piece part</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.460" end="01:15:07.420" style="s2">work better it&#39;s so important for game B</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.670" end="01:15:08.910" style="s2">well so the easiest part is conviviality</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.420" end="01:15:12.340" style="s2">literally just means living together</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.910" end="01:15:14.560" style="s2">living together this at a certain point</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.340" end="01:15:16.179" style="s2">in my life about 12 or 15 years ago the</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.560" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">word came into my vocabulary and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.179" end="01:15:19.540" style="s2">almost immediately I ended up actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.920" end="01:15:23.050" style="s2">running into it in the context of this</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.540" end="01:15:24.010" style="s2">really beautiful 70s author Ivan Illich</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.050" end="01:15:28.540" style="s2">who wrote a book</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.010" end="01:15:32.170" style="s2">tools for conviviality and the proper</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.540" end="01:15:33.790" style="s2">use of how we humans can create culture</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.170" end="01:15:35.850" style="s2">of which technology is a subset right</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.790" end="01:15:39.100" style="s2">technology is something that we create</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.850" end="01:15:40.930" style="s2">to afford our ability to be in the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.100" end="01:15:43.780" style="s2">so what is the right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.930" end="01:15:46.630" style="s2">between how we create culture to support</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.780" end="01:15:48.070" style="s2">our actually living as human beings in</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.630" end="01:15:50.470" style="s2">the world with ourselves and with each</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.070" end="01:15:51.880" style="s2">other so conviviality for me at least</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.470" end="01:15:55.750" style="s2">this is the way that I understand it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.880" end="01:15:57.130" style="s2">the conscious design of culture which</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.750" end="01:15:58.980" style="s2">includes rituals and tools and</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.130" end="01:16:02.980" style="s2">techniques and gatherings and events</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.980" end="01:16:05.050" style="s2">that are are able to increasingly fully</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.980" end="01:16:07.260" style="s2">support our personal growth our</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.050" end="01:16:10.420" style="s2">capacities in ourselves to be more</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.260" end="01:16:12.010" style="s2">richly living and our relational growth</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.420" end="01:16:13.000" style="s2">our capacity to find and be in</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.010" end="01:16:16.480" style="s2">relationships that are themselves</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.000" end="01:16:18.040" style="s2">inclusively rich and our sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.480" end="01:16:19.890" style="s2">relationship with the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.040" end="01:16:23.440" style="s2">like with the whole with the whole life</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.890" end="01:16:26.140" style="s2">I would add maybe this is my loading on</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.440" end="01:16:29.170" style="s2">conviviality I put a strong emphasis on</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.140" end="01:16:32.140" style="s2">face to face our actual primate being</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.170" end="01:16:34.330" style="s2">and that learning how we live with other</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.140" end="01:16:37.030" style="s2">people and get a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.330" end="01:16:38.290" style="s2">positive valence from that as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.030" end="01:16:40.000" style="s2">nothing you know on things that really</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.290" end="01:16:42.070" style="s2">pisses me off you know you go into a</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.000" end="01:16:43.600" style="s2">restaurant you see four people sitting</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.070" end="01:16:45.910" style="s2">around a table all of them on their</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.600" end="01:16:48.160" style="s2">phones that to my mind is the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.910" end="01:16:50.140" style="s2">of conviviality they should be enjoying</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.160" end="01:16:52.810" style="s2">each other as humans and interacting</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.140" end="01:16:54.820" style="s2">with each other as peers in a convivial</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.810" end="01:16:56.770" style="s2">style yeah we could we could say to like</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.820" end="01:16:59.980" style="s2">really really hit it with some poetry we</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.770" end="01:17:04.060" style="s2">can say that the conviviality is taking</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.980" end="01:17:06.690" style="s2">relationship as being sacred and taking</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.060" end="01:17:10.420" style="s2">the sacred as being most appropriately</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.690" end="01:17:11.920" style="s2">realized in the absolutely ordinary I</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.420" end="01:17:14.830" style="s2">like that sitting around a campfire</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:17.140" style="s2">singing goofy songs it doesn&#39;t get much</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.830" end="01:17:18.640" style="s2">better than that as it turns out yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.140" end="01:17:20.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t if you&#39;re under the stars and</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.640" end="01:17:23.140" style="s2">you&#39;re with people who you truly love</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.260" end="01:17:25.150" style="s2">and you&#39;re connecting in this way on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.140" end="01:17:27.220" style="s2">one hand absolutely ordinary I mean what</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.150" end="01:17:28.570" style="s2">could be more ordinary than that and at</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.220" end="01:17:30.850" style="s2">the same time we&#39;ve been doing it for</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.570" end="01:17:32.140" style="s2">200,000 years right yeah and at the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.850" end="01:17:33.880" style="s2">time like if you really are in that</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.140" end="01:17:35.350" style="s2">place you begin to notice oh like</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.880" end="01:17:37.410" style="s2">this is what they mean when they say</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.350" end="01:17:39.060" style="s2">connected to the sacred that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.410" end="01:17:40.890" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s conviviality I love</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.060" end="01:17:44.010" style="s2">it and I&#39;m more and more convinced that</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.890" end="01:17:46.980" style="s2">if conviviality can really be triggered</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.010" end="01:17:49.380" style="s2">this may be game B&#39;s secret weapon and I</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.980" end="01:17:51.780" style="s2">suspect that a lot of people would give</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.380" end="01:17:54.630" style="s2">up the BMW and the 10,000 square-foot</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.780" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">house or the rat race to live in the 600</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.630" end="01:18:00.960" style="s2">square foot house in Palo Alto in return</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.360" end="01:18:02.160" style="s2">for a life with real conviviality well</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.960" end="01:18:04.760" style="s2">you know who would agree most wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.160" end="01:18:06.990" style="s2">that who&#39;s that our old game B</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.760" end="01:18:09.210" style="s2">co-conspirator Joe Adelman remember him</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.990" end="01:18:10.830" style="s2">oh yeah a fact I&#39;m still in fairly</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.210" end="01:18:12.870" style="s2">regular communications with Joe at least</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.830" end="01:18:15.420" style="s2">electronically not convivial II though</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.870" end="01:18:17.040" style="s2">when he went into sport mode he went to</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.420" end="01:18:19.410" style="s2">Berlin and he&#39;s been working on that</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.040" end="01:18:20.370" style="s2">which is his like that&#39;s his heart</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.410" end="01:18:22.860" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.370" end="01:18:24.780" style="s2">and I mean his arguments trait forward</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.860" end="01:18:27.540" style="s2">like if you actually look at at what</p>

<p begin="01:18:27.540" end="01:18:30.690" style="s2">people do certain kinds of things like</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.250" end="01:18:32.490" style="s2">say here&#39;s what I care about</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.690" end="01:18:34.020" style="s2">then do various things then report on</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.490" end="01:18:36.120" style="s2">over time like many many different</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.020" end="01:18:37.230" style="s2">check-ins what felt more meaningful like</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.120" end="01:18:39.300" style="s2">what felt like it was actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.230" end="01:18:41.550" style="s2">fulfilling their needs and what he</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.300" end="01:18:46.380" style="s2">discovered exactly what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.550" end="01:18:48.960" style="s2">is that a potluck picnic was universally</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.380" end="01:18:52.200" style="s2">perceived short medium and long term as</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.960" end="01:18:56.880" style="s2">much more fulfilling than a fancy dinner</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.200" end="01:18:58.470" style="s2">or an expensive vacation and free yep</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.880" end="01:19:00.870" style="s2">Joe&#39;s time well spent</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.470" end="01:19:02.880" style="s2">research yeah that&#39;s exactly it I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.870" end="01:19:04.530" style="s2">remember hey Joe why don&#39;t we get you on</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.880" end="01:19:06.540" style="s2">the gym rut Joe I think we should talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.530" end="01:19:08.400" style="s2">about conviviality and nothing but for</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.540" end="01:19:10.530" style="s2">for the whole show okay we&#39;re gonna move</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.400" end="01:19:12.870" style="s2">on conviviality maybe the secret weapon</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.530" end="01:19:14.700" style="s2">for game be we talked about sense making</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.870" end="01:19:16.380" style="s2">and I&#39;ll give another little sidebar to</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.700" end="01:19:19.200" style="s2">a resource there&#39;s a Facebook group</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.380" end="01:19:20.850" style="s2">called rally point alpha which was</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.200" end="01:19:23.700" style="s2">started in response to one of Jordans</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.850" end="01:19:25.410" style="s2">essays and the focus on rally point</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.700" end="01:19:26.730" style="s2">alpha it&#39;s sense-making so if people are</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.410" end="01:19:27.960" style="s2">interested in thinking about sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.730" end="01:19:30.330" style="s2">making and learning how to do sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.960" end="01:19:31.860" style="s2">making not necessarily very well but</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.330" end="01:19:34.140" style="s2">maybe better than we do now check out</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.860" end="01:19:35.670" style="s2">rally point alpha but after since making</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.140" end="01:19:37.230" style="s2">and this is one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.670" end="01:19:39.720" style="s2">critiques of sense making sense making</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.230" end="01:19:43.320" style="s2">by itself isn&#39;t all that important until</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.720" end="01:19:45.060" style="s2">we then use that for action taking and</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.320" end="01:19:48.510" style="s2">it strikes me that we need to do a lot</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.060" end="01:19:51.119" style="s2">of exploring and experimenting and how</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.510" end="01:19:53.820" style="s2">we go from sense-making and meaning</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.119" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">and meaningfulness to action taking one</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.820" end="01:19:57.300" style="s2">of the people I&#39;ve talked with about</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.199" end="01:20:00.090" style="s2">this it&#39;s impressed me a fair amount is</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.300" end="01:20:02.699" style="s2">Forrest Landry who&#39;s done some very</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.090" end="01:20:05.399" style="s2">interesting work on how do we go from</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.699" end="01:20:07.499" style="s2">making sense to taking action so</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.399" end="01:20:09.780" style="s2">thoughts you have around action taking</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.499" end="01:20:11.429" style="s2">well I mean if we&#39;re going to invoke</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.780" end="01:20:12.719" style="s2">forest I&#39;ll just refer to force just</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.429" end="01:20:14.939" style="s2">find a way to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.719" end="01:20:16.559" style="s2">him there&#39;s nothing that I could say</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.939" end="01:20:18.719" style="s2">about this that would be close to what</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.559" end="01:20:21.059" style="s2">he could say about it and so it&#39;d be bad</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.719" end="01:20:24.510" style="s2">fence making for me to put noise into</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.059" end="01:20:26.099" style="s2">the signal with my poor version of what</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.510" end="01:20:27.959" style="s2">he could be doing it at a much more</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.099" end="01:20:30.030" style="s2">exquisite level so you&#39;ve just got</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.959" end="01:20:33.090" style="s2">another person at least last I checked</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.030" end="01:20:35.579" style="s2">he had not put out his ideas and a</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.090" end="01:20:37.800" style="s2">relatively condensed incoherent form</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.579" end="01:20:40.320" style="s2">maybe he has I&#39;ll go look if he has I</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.800" end="01:20:42.389" style="s2">put a little link up on the episode page</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.320" end="01:20:43.679" style="s2">and people go check it out if not off to</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.389" end="01:20:47.219" style="s2">get forced on here which I like to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.679" end="01:20:49.010" style="s2">anyway okay next a health and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.219" end="01:20:51.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean just health care but health</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.010" end="01:20:53.129" style="s2">yeah so what I&#39;ve what I&#39;ve done in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.570" end="01:20:55.289" style="s2">past I&#39;ve I&#39;ve actually taken this</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.129" end="01:20:58.019" style="s2">framework of saying okay health and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.289" end="01:21:02.789" style="s2">well-being and put them next to each</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.019" end="01:21:04.070" style="s2">other so I&#39;ve described health as we</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.789" end="01:21:08.070" style="s2">have to think about it in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.070" end="01:21:10.099" style="s2">whole being the whole person in life so</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.070" end="01:21:14.189" style="s2">obviously we&#39;ve got physiological help</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.099" end="01:21:16.860" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got psychological health and</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.189" end="01:21:18.090" style="s2">you got relational health these are all</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.860" end="01:21:19.769" style="s2">characteristics and they&#39;re all part of</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.090" end="01:21:20.820" style="s2">the whole human being and we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.769" end="01:21:21.899" style="s2">thinking about all of them and we need</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.820" end="01:21:24.059" style="s2">be thinking about this mission in terms</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.899" end="01:21:26.099" style="s2">of symmetry and synergy which is just</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.059" end="01:21:28.739" style="s2">say that if you optimize for it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.099" end="01:21:30.449" style="s2">I actually had a really really really</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.739" end="01:21:33.869" style="s2">skilled body worker which is just say</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.449" end="01:21:35.010" style="s2">torturer come by two days ago and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.869" end="01:21:36.479" style="s2">there&#39;s last night I can&#39;t remember I</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.010" end="01:21:37.979" style="s2">think I blacked out and he was giving me</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.479" end="01:21:39.570" style="s2">he asked like if you want to do on a</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.979" end="01:21:42.419" style="s2">relaxation massage or release massage</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.570" end="01:21:45.739" style="s2">and said man I&#39;ve been feeling pretty</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.419" end="01:21:48.510" style="s2">worked over give me a release massage</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.739" end="01:21:49.649" style="s2">and it was really painful like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.510" end="01:21:52.260" style="s2">kidding I think I may have blacked out</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.649" end="01:21:54.539" style="s2">somewhere around minute 90 and</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.260" end="01:21:56.879" style="s2">afterwards he comes and says you really</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.539" end="01:21:59.280" style="s2">need to stop the exercise regime that</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.879" end="01:22:02.309" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it&#39;s working in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.280" end="01:22:03.629" style="s2">that you&#39;re becoming stronger and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.309" end="01:22:05.340" style="s2">have certain levels of fitness but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.629" end="01:22:07.950" style="s2">also not working in all</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.340" end="01:22:09.900" style="s2">your body is hitting the wall in a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.950" end="01:22:12.420" style="s2">of different dimensions so health of</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.900" end="01:22:14.370" style="s2">course as a whole systems thing you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.420" end="01:22:15.810" style="s2">really have to be mindful of the nature</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.370" end="01:22:17.580" style="s2">and characteristics of the whole system</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.810" end="01:22:20.520" style="s2">and mindful of how to actually support</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.580" end="01:22:22.850" style="s2">all of those without making</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.520" end="01:22:24.870" style="s2">externalities or trade-offs that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.850" end="01:22:27.060" style="s2">falsely optimizing for certain</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.870" end="01:22:28.290" style="s2">subsystems and then of course you have</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.060" end="01:22:31.200" style="s2">to have embed that whole thing that</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.290" end="01:22:32.580" style="s2">whole healthy self in time like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.200" end="01:22:35.190" style="s2">moving through time and so this is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.580" end="01:22:37.350" style="s2">that that meta notion of from health to</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.190" end="01:22:39.600" style="s2">well-being is something where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.350" end="01:22:41.370" style="s2">you&#39;re finding a way to actually be in</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.600" end="01:22:44.820" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s the context that</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.370" end="01:22:46.170" style="s2">supports health ongoingly and so this</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.820" end="01:22:47.640" style="s2">might be things like you know linking</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.170" end="01:22:50.010" style="s2">back to things like in Divi ality and</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.640" end="01:22:52.710" style="s2">location you know it&#39;s one thing to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.010" end="01:22:55.470" style="s2">aware of good nutrition it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.710" end="01:22:57.750" style="s2">thing to be able to actually put food on</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.470" end="01:22:59.190" style="s2">the table and both are necessary like an</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.750" end="01:23:01.440" style="s2">you actually have well-being you have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.190" end="01:23:05.130" style="s2">have a context that supports the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.440" end="01:23:08.760" style="s2">practices of health ongoingly and</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.130" end="01:23:11.220" style="s2">ideally under increasingly diverse</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.760" end="01:23:15.000" style="s2">circumstances and so you can find a way</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.220" end="01:23:17.310" style="s2">of as I say travel from home to a</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.000" end="01:23:20.310" style="s2">different location have I built a</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.310" end="01:23:22.230" style="s2">certain you know set of techniques that</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.310" end="01:23:25.020" style="s2">I know are the ones that support my</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.230" end="01:23:26.010" style="s2">health in that say travel context so</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.020" end="01:23:27.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what I have to say about that</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.010" end="01:23:29.220" style="s2">that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.360" end="01:23:31.050" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna skip over a few go to another</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.220" end="01:23:32.120" style="s2">one that I think it&#39;s hugely deepam</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.050" end="01:23:35.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about a fair amount</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.120" end="01:23:37.470" style="s2">policing and justice I&#39;m gonna start</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.040" end="01:23:38.700" style="s2">with a quote from David Sloan Wilson I</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.470" end="01:23:40.160" style="s2">think I might have yanked this out of</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.700" end="01:23:44.010" style="s2">one of your essays I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.160" end="01:23:45.210" style="s2">selfishness beats altruism within groups</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.010" end="01:23:48.150" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.210" end="01:23:51.960" style="s2">altruistic groups beats selfish groups</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.150" end="01:23:53.880" style="s2">the rest is commentary yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.960" end="01:23:55.290" style="s2">this is a tricky tricky business isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.880" end="01:23:58.260" style="s2">it because you have that that trade-off</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.290" end="01:24:00.030" style="s2">between the two we&#39;re a group that</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.260" end="01:24:04.080" style="s2">succumbs to too much interior</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.030" end="01:24:05.850" style="s2">selfishness becomes feed for that group</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.080" end="01:24:07.680" style="s2">which has more capacity to maintain its</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.850" end="01:24:08.850" style="s2">integrity and have high enough level of</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.680" end="01:24:10.800" style="s2">altruism that it&#39;s actually strong in</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.850" end="01:24:12.780" style="s2">the other group and this is fractal</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.800" end="01:24:15.390" style="s2">meaning that when we say group we mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.780" end="01:24:16.860" style="s2">the two people and also 10 million and a</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.390" end="01:24:20.059" style="s2">billion as it were right so you got this</p>

<p begin="01:24:47.939" end="01:24:50.820" style="s2">mind and I&#39;m noticing if there&#39;s a and</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.619" end="01:24:52.079" style="s2">this is good because what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.820" end="01:24:54.360" style="s2">that through these different questions I</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.079" end="01:24:56.399" style="s2">think if you&#39;re able to kind of do a</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.360" end="01:24:58.469" style="s2">meta perception and seeing what are the</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.399" end="01:25:00.659" style="s2">commonalities I&#39;m noticing them so in</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.469" end="01:25:05.909" style="s2">the context of say something like health</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.659" end="01:25:09.179" style="s2">and in the context of sovereignty one of</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.909" end="01:25:11.610" style="s2">the things that that comes up I think I</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.179" end="01:25:13.889" style="s2">talked about this maybe then yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.610" end="01:25:14.849" style="s2">on a live stream so so yeah check this</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.889" end="01:25:17.070" style="s2">out I think I think this is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.849" end="01:25:21.419" style="s2">really nice when something happens to me</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.070" end="01:25:24.959" style="s2">that feels bad and broadly speaking I</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.419" end="01:25:28.349" style="s2">have kind of two ways of responding to</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.959" end="01:25:29.579" style="s2">it one is selecting from the different</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.349" end="01:25:32.999" style="s2">approaches that we might call a</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.579" end="01:25:34.709" style="s2">avoidance so avoidance in here includes</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.999" end="01:25:36.360" style="s2">by the way just just pounding it down so</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.709" end="01:25:37.889" style="s2">destruction like destroying that which</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.360" end="01:25:40.469" style="s2">is coming up as a version of avoidance I</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.889" end="01:25:44.459" style="s2">can dodge it I can delude myself I can</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.469" end="01:25:46.619" style="s2">become dead into it I can fight it these</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.459" end="01:25:47.699" style="s2">are all sort of characteristics of one</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.619" end="01:25:50.669" style="s2">way I might react to something that</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.699" end="01:25:53.969" style="s2">feels that another way of reacting when</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.669" end="01:25:57.019" style="s2">something feels bad we might call sake</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.969" end="01:25:58.979" style="s2">curiosity meaning there&#39;s signal here</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.019" end="01:26:00.599" style="s2">something is telling me that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.979" end="01:26:03.360" style="s2">something about the nature of a of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.599" end="01:26:06.090" style="s2">world and being me that isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.360" end="01:26:08.429" style="s2">and rather than just trying to avoid the</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.090" end="01:26:10.349" style="s2">signal taking the signal and the thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.429" end="01:26:11.789" style="s2">I&#39;m actually going to decouple them and</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.349" end="01:26:13.649" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m actually going to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.789" end="01:26:15.030" style="s2">coming deeply deeply curious about what</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.649" end="01:26:15.899" style="s2">the hell is going on which means in some</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.030" end="01:26:18.269" style="s2">sense I have to actually be able to</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.899" end="01:26:19.820" style="s2">stand in the discomfort for some amount</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.269" end="01:26:22.169" style="s2">of time might I may be quite unpleasant</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.820" end="01:26:24.449" style="s2">but it allows me to have a much more</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.169" end="01:26:26.729" style="s2">intimate relationship with what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.449" end="01:26:29.429" style="s2">at me and begin to decouple for example</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.729" end="01:26:31.050" style="s2">maybe the prefigured sense making right</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.429" end="01:26:33.240" style="s2">liminality the pre-period sense making</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.050" end="01:26:34.650" style="s2">that I have a phenomena and notice</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.240" end="01:26:37.410" style="s2">there&#39;s some deep learning that I can</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.650" end="01:26:39.870" style="s2">actually have that allows me to grow my</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.410" end="01:26:41.460" style="s2">capacities in response to the world and</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.870" end="01:26:43.350" style="s2">may in fact resolve that problem</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.460" end="01:26:45.810" style="s2">completely in forever it turns out that</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.350" end="01:26:47.700" style="s2">it was actually bad mapping on my part</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.810" end="01:26:49.050" style="s2">you know when I was seven</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.700" end="01:26:51.510" style="s2">you know something happened and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.050" end="01:26:53.070" style="s2">wrapped the signal around trauma and</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.510" end="01:26:54.930" style="s2">then every time the signal comes by I</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.070" end="01:26:56.370" style="s2">filled the trauma and I avoid it and it</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.930" end="01:26:57.960" style="s2">turns out that if I simply deal with it</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.370" end="01:26:58.920" style="s2">right now as a mature adult I can</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.960" end="01:27:01.530" style="s2">resolve it all together</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.920" end="01:27:03.420" style="s2">for example let&#39;s do the same thing that</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.530" end="01:27:05.100" style="s2">same kind of movement in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.420" end="01:27:09.450" style="s2">policing injustice let&#39;s say that every</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.100" end="01:27:12.870" style="s2">time an event occurs that shows up as</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.450" end="01:27:16.410" style="s2">some kind of injustice some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.870" end="01:27:19.650" style="s2">violation we can look at it as a problem</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.410" end="01:27:21.300" style="s2">to be addressed or we can actually come</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.650" end="01:27:23.640" style="s2">up with a lot of curiosity and say okay</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.300" end="01:27:25.290" style="s2">what&#39;s really happening here what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.640" end="01:27:27.180" style="s2">showing up oh cool</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.290" end="01:27:28.800" style="s2">I&#39;ll invoke parenting now so now as long</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.180" end="01:27:30.390" style="s2">as I have two kids I&#39;ve got you know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:27:49.770" end="01:27:54.620" style="s2">okay what we have is once again we have</p>

<p begin="01:28:18.090" end="01:28:22.770" style="s2">relationship with each other and do we</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.890" end="01:28:24.720" style="s2">have a sense of sitting still connected</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.770" end="01:28:27.600" style="s2">to a deeper sense of love a deeper sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.720" end="01:28:30.540" style="s2">of conviviality as the basis of where we</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.600" end="01:28:32.940" style="s2">are have we reconciled the hurt feelings</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.540" end="01:28:34.530" style="s2">first have we come to really understand</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.940" end="01:28:36.000" style="s2">it it&#39;s deeper level ourselves and the</p>

<p begin="01:28:36.000" end="01:28:40.530" style="s2">then finally let&#39;s look at the last</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.920" end="01:28:42.990" style="s2">piece and by the way very much the last</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.530" end="01:28:45.180" style="s2">piece is there something about an</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.990" end="01:28:46.710" style="s2">imbalance that has occurred that needs</p>

<p begin="01:28:50.190" end="01:28:54.929" style="s2">order so that&#39;s kind of coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.199" end="01:28:56.550" style="s2">bottom up and recognizing that any time</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.929" end="01:28:58.409" style="s2">something that happens that ends in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.550" end="01:29:01.289" style="s2">zone of injustice is first and foremost</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.409" end="01:29:04.019" style="s2">a signal of telling us to attend and to</p>

<p begin="01:29:04.019" end="01:29:07.889" style="s2">and listen deeply and notice what</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.999" end="01:29:09.179" style="s2">exactly is happening and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.889" end="01:29:11.190" style="s2">depth of what&#39;s happening because it may</p>

<p begin="01:29:11.190" end="01:29:15.659" style="s2">not be easy to know how to respond to it</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.110" end="01:29:17.340" style="s2">well and the things that need to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.659" end="01:29:19.679" style="s2">healed may be deep things that need to</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.340" end="01:29:20.969" style="s2">take a lot of work to heal and if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.679" end="01:29:22.289" style="s2">don&#39;t heal them you&#39;re not solving</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.969" end="01:29:24.479" style="s2">anything if I can be making the problem</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.289" end="01:29:25.800" style="s2">worse but if you do attend to it you get</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.479" end="01:29:27.239" style="s2">a sense of what it is that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.800" end="01:29:29.900" style="s2">healed and you&#39;re continuing to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.239" end="01:29:32.519" style="s2">that basis of conviviality and</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.900" end="01:29:34.440" style="s2">strengthening it from the bottom up then</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.519" end="01:29:37.050" style="s2">you&#39;re actually building something which</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.440" end="01:29:39.389" style="s2">is actually becoming anti fragile to</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.050" end="01:29:42.179" style="s2">injustice and justice is now something</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.389" end="01:29:44.550" style="s2">that is almost like hysteresis in</p>

<p begin="01:32:25.750" end="01:32:29.680" style="s2">example that I was using was the example</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.220" end="01:32:32.380" style="s2">of again parenting where my two-year-old</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.680" end="01:32:33.910" style="s2">is having a tantrum and you know with my</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.380" end="01:32:35.650" style="s2">Tyrael does having a tantrum he poses a</p>

<p begin="01:32:38.080" end="01:32:42.850" style="s2">difference between me kind of becoming</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.360" end="01:32:44.860" style="s2">reactive getting angry and grabbing him</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.850" end="01:32:47.200" style="s2">and kind of pulling him away and me</p>

<p begin="01:33:24.790" end="01:33:30.850" style="s2">do very much believe that that is quite</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.010" end="01:33:32.590" style="s2">possible and or they may nonetheless be</p>

<p begin="01:33:37.030" end="01:33:41.920" style="s2">so the sociopath is is sort of even part</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.730" end="01:33:43.420" style="s2">of the DSM diagnosis of the sociopath is</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.920" end="01:33:45.760" style="s2">that they make self-destructive</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.420" end="01:33:47.500" style="s2">high-risk choices and so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.760" end="01:33:49.960" style="s2">looking at that that&#39;s a way that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.500" end="01:33:52.150" style="s2">a design or an approach that helps us</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.960" end="01:33:53.980" style="s2">figure out how we solve those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.150" end="01:33:55.330" style="s2">problems from the inside out if that</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.980" end="01:33:56.920" style="s2">makes any sense I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.330" end="01:33:59.199" style="s2">more work to be done there by the way I</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.920" end="01:34:01.660" style="s2">would tell people that the failure modes</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.199" end="01:34:03.580" style="s2">of a lot of attempts to build new social</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.660" end="01:34:05.380" style="s2">operating systems have been around not</p>

<p begin="01:34:05.380" end="01:34:10.870" style="s2">either it becomes a dictatorship or it</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.110" end="01:34:13.239" style="s2">becomes so non judge judgemental that</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.870" end="01:34:15.190" style="s2">nobody bothers to take out the trash and</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.239" end="01:34:17.920" style="s2">everybody leads yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.190" end="01:34:19.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a real weird like a weird</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.920" end="01:34:20.320" style="s2">dichotomy and it doesn&#39;t make a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.300" end="01:34:23.110" style="s2">sense to me because I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.320" end="01:34:24.340" style="s2">learned this term discernment and I</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.110" end="01:34:26.440" style="s2">think the term discernment is very</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.340" end="01:34:28.690" style="s2">helpful here because this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.440" end="01:34:30.969" style="s2">non-judgmental it&#39;s just raw straight-up</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.690" end="01:34:32.890" style="s2">raw just a bad idea and I think you and</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.969" end="01:34:34.719" style="s2">I even kind of talked about this back in</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.890" end="01:34:36.340" style="s2">the old days like you you actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.719" end="01:34:38.260" style="s2">supporters like wait isn&#39;t good judgment</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.340" end="01:34:40.210" style="s2">of virtue absolutely I hate the word</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.260" end="01:34:42.040" style="s2">non-judgmental I said goddamn it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.210" end="01:34:44.140" style="s2">what humans do we make judgments right</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.040" end="01:34:45.940" style="s2">hey and the key is like if I just like</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.140" end="01:34:47.500" style="s2">use this term discernment which is in</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.940" end="01:34:50.080" style="s2">some sense just a different term but</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.500" end="01:34:52.300" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is something like like</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.080" end="01:34:54.070" style="s2">really just being aware with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.300" end="01:34:56.140" style="s2">actually happening like the reality you</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.070" end="01:34:59.860" style="s2">know again if the guy&#39;s got a gun and</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.140" end="01:35:01.330" style="s2">he&#39;s you know irrational then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.860" end="01:35:02.860" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and the way for me be</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.330" end="01:35:04.989" style="s2">in relationship with that is very</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.860" end="01:35:07.270" style="s2">constrained by the possibility space so</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.989" end="01:35:09.040" style="s2">now I&#39;ve found her to disarm him and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.270" end="01:35:10.570" style="s2">put him in a context where whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.040" end="01:35:11.739" style="s2">was like maybe he was on some sort of</p>

<p begin="01:35:11.739" end="01:35:14.949" style="s2">processed through his system well now we</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.510" end="01:35:16.239" style="s2">have a possibility of maybe exploring</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.949" end="01:35:18.400" style="s2">something else I could have a very</p>

<p begin="01:35:18.400" end="01:35:22.660" style="s2">it&#39;s not non-judgmental it&#39;s just like</p>

<p begin="01:35:45.340" end="01:35:51.340" style="s2">because if I turn my empathy way out</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.610" end="01:35:53.380" style="s2">what happens instantaneously is that I</p>

<p begin="01:36:35.440" end="01:36:39.640" style="s2">think there&#39;s actually a higher-order</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.670" end="01:36:42.280" style="s2">notion here that needs to be brought to</p>

<p begin="01:36:56.710" end="01:37:00.880" style="s2">real context would be sort of like the</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.230" end="01:37:03.220" style="s2">bizarre ly simple answer to that problem</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.880" end="01:37:04.450" style="s2">in the game be way great I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.220" end="01:37:07.570" style="s2">skip a bunch of others I&#39;m gonna go to</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.450" end="01:37:09.910" style="s2">the one I have come to believe is right</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.570" end="01:37:12.640" style="s2">up there with conviviality as the secret</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.910" end="01:37:15.850" style="s2">to making game B work but it has some</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.640" end="01:37:20.860" style="s2">interesting risk aspects to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.850" end="01:37:22.330" style="s2">coherence hmm well you know first of all</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.860" end="01:37:24.850" style="s2">we recognize that even as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.330" end="01:37:26.440" style="s2">it that&#39;s a word that has a lot of many</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.850" end="01:37:30.370" style="s2">people use that word to mean many things</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.440" end="01:37:31.360" style="s2">and so the way that I use it and in John</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.370" end="01:37:33.640" style="s2">for baekje and I were just actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.360" end="01:37:37.150" style="s2">talking about this exact issue just</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.640" end="01:37:39.469" style="s2">before this call is something along the</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.150" end="01:37:45.590" style="s2">lines of</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.469" end="01:37:47.539" style="s2">the way that distinct parts can generate</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.590" end="01:37:49.340" style="s2">a synergistic relationship which is to</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.539" end="01:37:52.030" style="s2">say create an emergent hole that is</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.340" end="01:37:55.939" style="s2">greater than the sum of the parts that</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.030" end="01:38:00.199" style="s2">has a very specific characteristic which</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.939" end="01:38:04.630" style="s2">is that this larger hole simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.199" end="01:38:07.300" style="s2">is autonomy enhancing for the part and</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.630" end="01:38:10.159" style="s2">therefore and that therefore is crucial</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.300" end="01:38:13.340" style="s2">increases the probability and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.159" end="01:38:15.229" style="s2">intensity of the synergy that creates</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.340" end="01:38:17.840" style="s2">the emergent hole and so this is a I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.229" end="01:38:19.729" style="s2">almost like just defining coherence from</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.840" end="01:38:22.369" style="s2">a design perspective that there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.729" end="01:38:24.199" style="s2">many different ways of parts coming</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.369" end="01:38:26.090" style="s2">together to form holes and I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.199" end="01:38:29.239" style="s2">I&#39;m using two coherence to describe this</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.090" end="01:38:30.949" style="s2">exact like slice and we see this</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.239" end="01:38:33.369" style="s2">happening like the things that matter in</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.949" end="01:38:36.559" style="s2">the world are coherent in that fashion</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.369" end="01:38:40.189" style="s2">and the more you were able to be cohere</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.559" end="01:38:41.289" style="s2">in that fashion the more well-being and</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.189" end="01:38:43.489" style="s2">the way that I described it earlier</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.289" end="01:38:45.919" style="s2">emerges for the parts and the whole I</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.489" end="01:38:47.689" style="s2">like that a lot actually it helps</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.919" end="01:38:49.309" style="s2">clarify what you&#39;re getting at because</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.689" end="01:38:50.840" style="s2">when I hear the word coherence I start</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.309" end="01:38:52.789" style="s2">to think a little bit like a cult where</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.840" end="01:38:55.010" style="s2">everybody believes the same thing but</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.789" end="01:38:57.289" style="s2">when you say your kind of coherence</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.010" end="01:39:00.349" style="s2">should also be trying to maximize</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.289" end="01:39:01.969" style="s2">people&#39;s autonomy then you actually have</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.349" end="01:39:03.889" style="s2">a very interesting design problem to</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.969" end="01:39:05.989" style="s2">make both of those thing of both you</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.889" end="01:39:09.289" style="s2">know real coherence to get things done</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.989" end="01:39:11.209" style="s2">but also to try to maximize or at least</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.289" end="01:39:12.650" style="s2">do a good job with autonomy you have a</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.209" end="01:39:15.289" style="s2">very interesting and difficult design</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.650" end="01:39:17.809" style="s2">problem and an approach I&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.289" end="01:39:20.510" style="s2">coherent pluralism that you have to find</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.809" end="01:39:22.579" style="s2">out where should there be agreement and</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.510" end="01:39:25.010" style="s2">where should there be liberty and</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.579" end="01:39:27.499" style="s2">getting that design space right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.010" end="01:39:29.419" style="s2">gonna be tricky yeah it&#39;s tricky but</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.499" end="01:39:32.719" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.419" end="01:39:34.519" style="s2">human beings and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.719" end="01:39:35.979" style="s2">something that Breton and we actually</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.519" end="01:39:38.269" style="s2">talked about with Brett back in the day</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.979" end="01:39:40.820" style="s2">this may be the thing that human beings</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.269" end="01:39:44.959" style="s2">are like what makes us what we are that</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.820" end="01:39:46.369" style="s2">the the capacity for think of it think</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.959" end="01:39:48.229" style="s2">about it like working backwards let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.369" end="01:39:50.479" style="s2">say you&#39;ve developed that an organism</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.229" end="01:39:52.099" style="s2">has emerged and this organism has the</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.479" end="01:39:53.150" style="s2">capacity to be coherent in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.099" end="01:39:54.920" style="s2">I&#39;m describing it</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.150" end="01:39:56.480" style="s2">one of the things that falls out of that</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.920" end="01:39:58.550" style="s2">is this the capacity for division of</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.480" end="01:40:00.890" style="s2">labor becomes a thing because now I can</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.550" end="01:40:02.449" style="s2">have people individuals who are</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.890" end="01:40:04.820" style="s2">specialized meaning they actually have</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.449" end="01:40:06.830" style="s2">quite distinct perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.820" end="01:40:08.000" style="s2">capacities in life and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.830" end="01:40:10.790" style="s2">recognize that right if I&#39;ve become a</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.000" end="01:40:12.140" style="s2">doctor and you&#39;ve become a farmer the</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.790" end="01:40:16.330" style="s2">specialization in these particular</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.140" end="01:40:18.920" style="s2">skills implies for sure also distinct</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.330" end="01:40:20.120" style="s2">epistemologies and distinct habits of</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.920" end="01:40:22.940" style="s2">mind and how we just relate to life</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.120" end="01:40:26.360" style="s2">because just that&#39;s implicit in in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.940" end="01:40:28.300" style="s2">becoming skillful well one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.360" end="01:40:31.400" style="s2">that we know of course is that is</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.300" end="01:40:34.280" style="s2">distinctness in that sense oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.400" end="01:40:35.449" style="s2">leads to out grooving and we see this</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.280" end="01:40:37.760" style="s2">happening willy-nilly in our current</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.449" end="01:40:40.250" style="s2">barment that unique distinct</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.760" end="01:40:42.469" style="s2">perspectives oftentimes just can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.250" end="01:40:45.949" style="s2">ways to agree and so they fall apart</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.469" end="01:40:47.480" style="s2">well but if as a species you happen to</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.949" end="01:40:48.739" style="s2">have figured out how to maintain the</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.480" end="01:40:51.199" style="s2">kind of coherence that I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.739" end="01:40:53.750" style="s2">then you get this massive massive up</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.199" end="01:40:56.780" style="s2">regulation huge superpower which is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.750" end="01:40:58.870" style="s2">you can support enormous specialization</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.780" end="01:41:03.020" style="s2">and division of labor while maintaining</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.870" end="01:41:04.610" style="s2">the integrity of the whole and that will</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.020" end="01:41:06.380" style="s2">out-compete anything that can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.610" end="01:41:08.179" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.380" end="01:41:09.650" style="s2">I clean I think Brett really nailed it</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.179" end="01:41:13.850" style="s2">when he said that that may in fact be</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.650" end="01:41:14.840" style="s2">precisely what we are about we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.850" end="01:41:16.940" style="s2">that but that&#39;s our one of our</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.840" end="01:41:18.739" style="s2">fundamental codes like in our bodies is</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.940" end="01:41:20.510" style="s2">a skillfulness and being able to do that</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.739" end="01:41:22.040" style="s2">and then we&#39;re kind of back to the</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.510" end="01:41:25.250" style="s2">problem on the whiteboard in Stanton</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.040" end="01:41:27.290" style="s2">which is our biological code helps us do</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.250" end="01:41:30.230" style="s2">that kind of coherence at the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.290" end="01:41:31.580" style="s2">level and for us to pop through the game</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.230" end="01:41:33.890" style="s2">be we need to figure out how to do that</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.580" end="01:41:36.679" style="s2">at a much larger level well now you just</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.890" end="01:41:38.810" style="s2">hit my last bullet point on this section</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.679" end="01:41:40.640" style="s2">which is all the above have to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.810" end="01:41:44.060" style="s2">engineered to work at the Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.640" end="01:41:45.469" style="s2">and and above well above and for those</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.060" end="01:41:47.810" style="s2">of you in the audience who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.469" end="01:41:50.540" style="s2">what the Dunbar number is Robin Dunbar a</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.810" end="01:41:52.460" style="s2">I think he&#39;s an anthropologist studied</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.540" end="01:41:54.739" style="s2">human three modern societies and</p>

<p begin="01:42:20.720" end="01:42:25.010" style="s2">get us way beyond 150 but one of the big</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.240" end="01:42:27.200" style="s2">challenges of game B is to get all these</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.010" end="01:42:30.140" style="s2">things we just talked about to work at</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.200" end="01:42:33.080" style="s2">very much larger groups than 150 so why</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.140" end="01:42:34.520" style="s2">don&#39;t you talk about massively exceeding</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.080" end="01:42:37.010" style="s2">the Dunbar number and yet nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.520" end="01:42:39.050" style="s2">making these good things happen yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.010" end="01:42:40.660" style="s2">here we have like here&#39;s the phrase that</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.050" end="01:42:43.100" style="s2">they the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.660" end="01:42:45.110" style="s2">this is the hard problem of game bei and</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.100" end="01:42:47.510" style="s2">you know we came across this problem</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.110" end="01:42:49.250" style="s2">seven years ago we drew it wrote it down</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.510" end="01:42:52.040" style="s2">we looked at it with Banger head on it</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.250" end="01:42:53.360" style="s2">you know it definitely overmatched our</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.040" end="01:42:56.720" style="s2">capacity back then and I can say for</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.360" end="01:42:58.310" style="s2">sure we still haven&#39;t got a even a</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.720" end="01:43:00.350" style="s2">vaguely good approach and how to solve a</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.310" end="01:43:02.150" style="s2">problem though really smart people say</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.350" end="01:43:04.640" style="s2">like forests are working on it</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.150" end="01:43:07.550" style="s2">diligently so here&#39;s something that the</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.640" end="01:43:10.160" style="s2">that has come to me a lot on how how the</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.550" end="01:43:14.420" style="s2">the solution to this problem may in fact</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.160" end="01:43:16.160" style="s2">be let&#39;s call it discoverable and it has</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.420" end="01:43:17.690" style="s2">to do with gluing together some of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.160" end="01:43:19.040" style="s2">things we&#39;ve talked about and most</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.690" end="01:43:22.610" style="s2">notably it has to do with gluing</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.040" end="01:43:27.590" style="s2">together this idea of the accelerating</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.610" end="01:43:30.380" style="s2">change the adjacent possible and the the</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.590" end="01:43:32.420" style="s2">characteristics of what is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.380" end="01:43:36.980" style="s2">organism in this case a distributed</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.420" end="01:43:43.490" style="s2">cognition group of people that is able</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.980" end="01:43:45.050" style="s2">to maintain its continuity and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.490" end="01:43:46.280" style="s2">the right it&#39;s like the visual image I</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.050" end="01:43:48.260" style="s2">have it&#39;s like being in the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.280" end="01:43:51.320" style="s2">the river like in the in the sweet spot</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.260" end="01:43:54.500" style="s2">on a wave being able to actually find</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.320" end="01:43:58.100" style="s2">where the energy of the the most rapid</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.500" end="01:44:00.170" style="s2">coherent location on the wave of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.100" end="01:44:02.720" style="s2">adjacent possible is located and so the</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.170" end="01:44:04.370" style="s2">the proposition that I&#39;m making is there</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.720" end="01:44:07.430" style="s2">may be in fact be something like an</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.370" end="01:44:11.210" style="s2">attractor in reality itself that is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.430" end="01:44:12.890" style="s2">relationship between the curve the</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.210" end="01:44:17.930" style="s2">accelerating curve of the adjacent</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.890" end="01:44:23.000" style="s2">possible the the way that a distributed</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.930" end="01:44:27.650" style="s2">mission is constructed such that it can</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.000" end="01:44:29.630" style="s2">simultaneously most fully move through</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.650" end="01:44:33.590" style="s2">or accelerate with that accelerating</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.630" end="01:44:36.700" style="s2">curve while also not falling apart so I</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.590" end="01:44:39.710" style="s2">so come a visual image of this like a</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.700" end="01:44:43.040" style="s2">series of soap bubbles in a current and</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.710" end="01:44:46.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a like a flow around the outside</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.040" end="01:44:48.410" style="s2">of a spot that has a stability to it and</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.760" end="01:44:50.140" style="s2">those bubbles that migrate to the</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.410" end="01:44:52.250" style="s2">outside just get pulled out in the flow</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.140" end="01:44:54.980" style="s2">those bubbles that stay on the inside</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.250" end="01:44:58.460" style="s2">stay in the sweet spot it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.980" end="01:44:59.930" style="s2">like that I mean that is obviously I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.460" end="01:45:01.790" style="s2">not even sure that I just spoke to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.930" end="01:45:03.410" style="s2">perfectly frank like I was definitely</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.790" end="01:45:06.350" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to stitch hard stuff together</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.410" end="01:45:07.730" style="s2">so invoke rule Omega but but the</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.350" end="01:45:10.040" style="s2">proposition is there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.730" end="01:45:12.020" style="s2">this notion that we&#39;re actually looking</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.040" end="01:45:14.060" style="s2">at reality where we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.020" end="01:45:16.000" style="s2">reality here we are not the ones who are</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.060" end="01:45:19.310" style="s2">designing this it&#39;s more like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.000" end="01:45:21.860" style="s2">discovering it and at the same time that</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.310" end="01:45:24.590" style="s2">we are designing it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.860" end="01:45:26.840" style="s2">something about the way that the</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.590" end="01:45:29.600" style="s2">intrinsic dynamic certain intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.840" end="01:45:32.570" style="s2">relationships of how distributed</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.600" end="01:45:34.790" style="s2">cognition comes together and is able to</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.570" end="01:45:37.220" style="s2">maintain an integrity in itself which if</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.790" end="01:45:38.600" style="s2">it reduces its integrity it slows down</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.220" end="01:45:42.080" style="s2">but it actually becomes less and less</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.600" end="01:45:45.170" style="s2">effective that is the answer to the to</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.080" end="01:45:48.080" style="s2">the question of scaling coherent</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.170" end="01:45:50.420" style="s2">collective intelligence yeah it strikes</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.080" end="01:45:52.820" style="s2">me using complexity speak that the</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.420" end="01:45:54.950" style="s2">problem here is to grow an emergence</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.820" end="01:45:56.630" style="s2">right and we one of the things about</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.950" end="01:45:58.580" style="s2">emergence is we don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.630" end="01:46:01.040" style="s2">till it emerges which makes it damn</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.580" end="01:46:02.540" style="s2">tricky so we&#39;re in a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.040" end="01:46:04.160" style="s2">chicken-and-egg problem we know that</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.540" end="01:46:05.810" style="s2">there in the words you gave are actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.160" end="01:46:07.130" style="s2">evocative they weren&#39;t descriptive but</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.810" end="01:46:09.530" style="s2">they were evocative so they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.130" end="01:46:12.710" style="s2">entirely nonsense even at times it may</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.530" end="01:46:14.600" style="s2">seem like it but they&#39;re evocative of</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.710" end="01:46:17.440" style="s2">what this emergence might be that</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.600" end="01:46:20.180" style="s2">provides us the ability to do long span</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.440" end="01:46:22.850" style="s2">coherent problem-solving using much</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.180" end="01:46:25.100" style="s2">larger groups of people than than 150</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.850" end="01:46:27.620" style="s2">yeah yeah and so we have to experiment</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.100" end="01:46:30.170" style="s2">it seems to mean try things and and make</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.620" end="01:46:31.460" style="s2">guesses about what what might drive this</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.170" end="01:46:33.080" style="s2">emergence but we won&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.460" end="01:46:34.370" style="s2">what it is until it gets here right</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.080" end="01:46:36.770" style="s2">exactly and there&#39;s something about like</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.370" end="01:46:38.960" style="s2">metal learning which is the our ability</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.770" end="01:46:41.330" style="s2">to experiment extremely effectively that</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.960" end="01:46:43.790" style="s2">I think is key you&#39;ll have noticed for</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.330" end="01:46:45.080" style="s2">example that like I&#39;ve had this recent</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.790" end="01:46:48.260" style="s2">set of conversations with this guy named</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.080" end="01:46:50.120" style="s2">guy sing stock and he has built a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.260" end="01:46:52.460" style="s2">skillfulness in a particular psycho</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.120" end="01:46:53.870" style="s2">technology called circling and one of</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.460" end="01:46:56.690" style="s2">the things that happens in circling is</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.870" end="01:46:58.940" style="s2">you build a lot of sensitivity to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.690" end="01:47:02.000" style="s2">happening right now so he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.940" end="01:47:03.800" style="s2">aware of like what&#39;s going on at the</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.000" end="01:47:06.710" style="s2">level of like we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re mammals</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.800" end="01:47:08.360" style="s2">interacting and at the level of like</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.710" end="01:47:10.550" style="s2">subconscious assumptions that were</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.360" end="01:47:14.000" style="s2">bringing in and because he has that</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.550" end="01:47:16.400" style="s2">skillfulness he can point or move or</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.000" end="01:47:19.400" style="s2">shift the conversation in a place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.400" end="01:47:23.239" style="s2">actually able to achieve a higher level</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.400" end="01:47:25.969" style="s2">of quality and more we&#39;re learning more</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.239" end="01:47:28.969" style="s2">things faster and there&#39;s a recursion</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.969" end="01:47:30.260" style="s2">there which is that knowing that I could</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.969" end="01:47:32.300" style="s2">say okay well let me see if I can find a</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.260" end="01:47:34.160" style="s2">way to experiment by bringing guy into a</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.300" end="01:47:37.190" style="s2">conversation this is gonna happen action</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.160" end="01:47:39.050" style="s2">a couple of weeks me guy John Johnny V</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.190" end="01:47:40.700" style="s2">and another guy Chris who I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.050" end="01:47:42.830" style="s2">are gonna have a conversation with the</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.700" end="01:47:44.989" style="s2">four of us and we&#39;re gonna notice is</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.830" end="01:47:47.180" style="s2">there something about this combination</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.989" end="01:47:50.140" style="s2">of skills that we&#39;re bringing that</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.180" end="01:47:52.070" style="s2">actually generates a more potent</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.140" end="01:47:54.340" style="s2">conversation are we actually creating a</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.070" end="01:47:57.290" style="s2">meta learning community are we learning</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.340" end="01:48:00.110" style="s2">faster about how to go about learning</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.290" end="01:48:01.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s a powerful thing right</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.110" end="01:48:02.840" style="s2">because if you if you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.340" end="01:48:05.480" style="s2">working at the level of meta learning</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.840" end="01:48:07.670" style="s2">then every step that you take actually</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.480" end="01:48:09.110" style="s2">gets to work on the on the vector of</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.670" end="01:48:11.540" style="s2">acceleration instead of on the vector of</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.110" end="01:48:13.940" style="s2">velocity and that&#39;s how you how you get</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.540" end="01:48:15.140" style="s2">places fast so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.940" end="01:48:17.390" style="s2">that right there&#39;s something about being</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.140" end="01:48:18.620" style="s2">able to have lots of basics like I was a</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.390" end="01:48:20.840" style="s2">lot of the things that I spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.620" end="01:48:22.520" style="s2">time describing is look if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.840" end="01:48:24.620" style="s2">built your sovereign two to a certain</p>

<p begin="01:48:24.620" end="01:48:29.330" style="s2">participate so this whole notion of like</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.060" end="01:48:30.860" style="s2">the pre B there&#39;s a lot of basic stuff</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.330" end="01:48:32.510" style="s2">that we can we can now point to and say</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.860" end="01:48:35.150" style="s2">look in order to be able to participate</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.510" end="01:48:36.890" style="s2">in a community of meta learning here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.150" end="01:48:38.540" style="s2">bunch of pre work that you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.890" end="01:48:40.150" style="s2">in place because these are seem quite</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.540" end="01:48:43.070" style="s2">likely to be minimum requirements and</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.150" end="01:48:44.120" style="s2">and then you have the the higher level</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.070" end="01:48:45.320" style="s2">approach of okay well we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.120" end="01:48:46.970" style="s2">community of meta learning</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.320" end="01:48:48.710" style="s2">and meta learning is about not just</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.970" end="01:48:50.330" style="s2">experimenting but actually using the</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.710" end="01:48:52.100" style="s2">output of experiments to improve the</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.330" end="01:48:53.540" style="s2">experimental protocol so you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.100" end="01:48:55.760" style="s2">better and better and better at actually</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.540" end="01:48:57.590" style="s2">orienting and designing your experiments</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.760" end="01:48:59.030" style="s2">and you&#39;re getting an acceleration on</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.590" end="01:49:02.450" style="s2">your learning instead of just a velocity</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.030" end="01:49:04.160" style="s2">of learning I like that&#39;s a way to get</p>

<p begin="01:49:04.160" end="01:49:07.010" style="s2">hopeful way to get beyond the</p>

<p begin="01:49:09.020" end="01:49:12.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t have about ten minutes here so</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.760" end="01:49:14.960" style="s2">we won&#39;t be able to get into it very</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.350" end="01:49:18.110" style="s2">deeply but the idea is we have this pre</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.960" end="01:49:19.850" style="s2">B pre game B world pre B and we just</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.110" end="01:49:21.800" style="s2">talked about great depth and it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.850" end="01:49:23.090" style="s2">we are today it&#39;s what we all who are</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.800" end="01:49:24.650" style="s2">interested in game B should be working</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.090" end="01:49:26.270" style="s2">on some or all these things actually not</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.650" end="01:49:28.190" style="s2">nobody can work on all of them but you</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.270" end="01:49:29.960" style="s2">know find some of them work on them but</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.190" end="01:49:31.730" style="s2">they&#39;ll become a time at some point in</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.960" end="01:49:34.220" style="s2">the future where some group of people</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.730" end="01:49:37.040" style="s2">think that we&#39;ve mastered enough of this</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.220" end="01:49:38.750" style="s2">and minimally enough of this to try to</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.040" end="01:49:42.170" style="s2">create the first I think what you called</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.750" end="01:49:45.830" style="s2">hole an attempt to you know to create a</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.170" end="01:49:47.630" style="s2">integrated way of game B life that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.830" end="01:49:49.190" style="s2">think about this more mechanically I</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.630" end="01:49:52.100" style="s2">think we probably mix and match piece</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.190" end="01:49:54.110" style="s2">parts and wrap the piece parts in some</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.100" end="01:49:56.720" style="s2">form of integrated operating system and</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.110" end="01:49:59.000" style="s2">give it a world may not succeed but it</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.720" end="01:50:01.490" style="s2">will be the first attempt to build a</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.000" end="01:50:04.280" style="s2">coherent whole and by no means will it</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.490" end="01:50:07.580" style="s2">be complete on day one right if we spun</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.280" end="01:50:10.550" style="s2">up a proto game B or proto B as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.580" end="01:50:13.390" style="s2">calling it we&#39;re gonna be very likely to</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.550" end="01:50:16.460" style="s2">be very dependent on things from game a</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.390" end="01:50:18.590" style="s2">things like computer chips hospitals</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.460" end="01:50:20.210" style="s2">maybe public schools I hope not hoping</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.590" end="01:50:22.490" style="s2">to do a better job than that it&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.210" end="01:50:23.990" style="s2">number of things that that we may well</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.490" end="01:50:25.040" style="s2">still be dependent on and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.990" end="01:50:27.350" style="s2">point that you made from the very</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.040" end="01:50:30.260" style="s2">beginning of the game B story we will</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.350" end="01:50:32.930" style="s2">also in proto be days be consciously and</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.260" end="01:50:35.180" style="s2">hopefully talented at parasitizing game</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.930" end="01:50:38.300" style="s2">a essentially pulling energy out of game</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.180" end="01:50:40.520" style="s2">a to help build game B in fact the</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.300" end="01:50:42.500" style="s2">earliest proto B&#39;s may well be dependent</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.520" end="01:50:44.960" style="s2">on getting good at that parasitism right</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.500" end="01:50:47.600" style="s2">so does that seem reasonable to you this</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.960" end="01:50:50.090" style="s2">idea of a proto B which is a mix and</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.600" end="01:50:52.130" style="s2">match plus an attempt at an integrated</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.090" end="01:50:54.710" style="s2">operating system that&#39;s not complete but</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.130" end="01:50:56.330" style="s2">it&#39;s nonetheless whole yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.710" end="01:50:57.620" style="s2">think the answer is yes and it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.330" end="01:50:59.019" style="s2">because in some sense like remember I</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.620" end="01:51:00.639" style="s2">keep bringing up this point there are</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.019" end="01:51:03.429" style="s2">already playing game b-but maybe a lower</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.639" end="01:51:06.309" style="s2">level my family which is a Vanessa</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.429" end="01:51:09.729" style="s2">Eloise and I are a proto B in a very low</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.309" end="01:51:11.709" style="s2">level because we&#39;re doing parenting from</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.729" end="01:51:12.969" style="s2">a game B perspective which implies were</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.709" end="01:51:14.709" style="s2">also doing education from a game B</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.969" end="01:51:16.359" style="s2">perspective we take into account</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.709" end="01:51:18.279" style="s2">conviviality from a game B perspective</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.359" end="01:51:20.049" style="s2">says we&#39;re kind of looking at all the</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.279" end="01:51:21.939" style="s2">pieces and trying really hard to do them</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.049" end="01:51:24.039" style="s2">recognizing that almost all of our</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.939" end="01:51:25.539" style="s2">actual lives are spent in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.039" end="01:51:27.819" style="s2">game a so there&#39;s like this really</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.539" end="01:51:31.599" style="s2">interesting thing like it&#39;s a what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.819" end="01:51:33.579" style="s2">term like in Co hate or possibility not</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.599" end="01:51:34.449" style="s2">yet actuality but nonetheless something</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.579" end="01:51:36.639" style="s2">there and the reason why I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.449" end="01:51:39.909" style="s2">bring that up is that I sense the the</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.639" end="01:51:42.819" style="s2">the popping or emergence of proto B will</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.909" end="01:51:44.679" style="s2">have a look like almost maybe even a</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.819" end="01:51:45.879" style="s2">little bit of a level of surprise on the</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.679" end="01:51:48.399" style="s2">part of the people who are involved like</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.879" end="01:51:49.839" style="s2">less about we&#39;re all gonna all at once</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.399" end="01:51:51.429" style="s2">like this 500 people gonna gather</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.839" end="01:51:53.739" style="s2">together and try and do something but</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.429" end="01:51:55.869" style="s2">rather a bunch of people have actually</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.739" end="01:51:57.399" style="s2">been been actually living more and more</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.869" end="01:51:59.349" style="s2">and learning better and better how to do</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.399" end="01:52:00.549" style="s2">more game B living and also they</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.349" end="01:52:02.769" style="s2">discovered that certain pieces have</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.549" end="01:52:04.239" style="s2">dropped at pop Wow something really has</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.769" end="01:52:05.769" style="s2">changed like suddenly there are more</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.239" end="01:52:08.049" style="s2">people showing up and it&#39;s working or</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.769" end="01:52:10.179" style="s2">big pieces of what we had previously</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.049" end="01:52:12.339" style="s2">really had to be dependent on game a has</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.179" end="01:52:13.689" style="s2">just dropped away or this group over</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.339" end="01:52:15.729" style="s2">here at a massive insight of how to</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.689" end="01:52:17.169" style="s2">solve for some particular problem and as</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.729" end="01:52:18.399" style="s2">soon as we were able to share that</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.169" end="01:52:20.499" style="s2">insight with each other it shifted</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.399" end="01:52:22.059" style="s2">something for us and now we&#39;re holding a</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.499" end="01:52:23.679" style="s2">bunch of capacity like that kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.059" end="01:52:25.210" style="s2">thing I feel like that&#39;s how it will</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.679" end="01:52:27.730" style="s2">show up</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.210" end="01:52:30.340" style="s2">the next piece is really really really</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.730" end="01:52:31.480" style="s2">want to distinguish this from every</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.340" end="01:52:34.600" style="s2">intentional community that has ever</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.480" end="01:52:36.520" style="s2">existed as far as I can tell and and a</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.600" end="01:52:38.080" style="s2">big piece of it is this this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.520" end="01:52:41.860" style="s2">we&#39;ve I&#39;ve been kind of hammering on</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.080" end="01:52:44.560" style="s2">which is if we do game B right the thing</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.860" end="01:52:46.060" style="s2">that game B can do really well then the</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.560" end="01:52:49.210" style="s2">game we can do much much better than</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.060" end="01:52:53.590" style="s2">game a happens to be at the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.210" end="01:52:55.659" style="s2">cutting edge of generative capacity in</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.590" end="01:52:58.570" style="s2">game a well most of the time like</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.659" end="01:53:01.030" style="s2">oftentimes so for example you know I</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.570" end="01:53:03.489" style="s2">remember watching a documentary around a</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.030" end="01:53:04.570" style="s2">pretty well-established intentional</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.489" end="01:53:06.820" style="s2">community that was established in the</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.570" end="01:53:08.500" style="s2">60s or 70s down in Central America and</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.820" end="01:53:10.120" style="s2">one of the problems that they had was</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.500" end="01:53:12.610" style="s2">that of course for a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.120" end="01:53:14.710" style="s2">they had to import resources from what</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.610" end="01:53:16.540" style="s2">we would call game a and to do that they</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.710" end="01:53:18.040" style="s2">had to get money and to do that they had</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.540" end="01:53:19.179" style="s2">to sell stuff but what could they make</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.040" end="01:53:21.190" style="s2">well they were making I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.179" end="01:53:22.870" style="s2">I know coconut furniture or like</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.190" end="01:53:26.440" style="s2">hand-woven clothes or some artisanal</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.870" end="01:53:28.540" style="s2">crap like that and that&#39;s very very weak</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.440" end="01:53:29.949" style="s2">like there&#39;s no love of strength in that</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.540" end="01:53:31.690" style="s2">relationship there they&#39;re operating at</p>

<p begin="01:54:09.670" end="01:54:14.469" style="s2">collaboration so it&#39;s entirely feasible</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.920" end="01:54:18.250" style="s2">and in fact I would propose more likely</p>

<p begin="01:54:26.320" end="01:54:29.949" style="s2">just be like this new form of say a</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.730" end="01:54:31.540" style="s2">startup and the blockchain stuff was</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.949" end="01:54:33.550" style="s2">almost there like some of the blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.540" end="01:54:34.870" style="s2">stuff you could feel like almost moving</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.550" end="01:54:38.469" style="s2">in that direction that this notion of</p>

<p begin="01:54:44.619" end="01:54:47.499" style="s2">just gonna stop working at Microsoft and</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.239" end="01:54:49.690" style="s2">work on this and move the ball forward</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.499" end="01:54:51.429" style="s2">if you could just move that forward that</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.690" end="01:54:54.639" style="s2">whole notion that one or two steps and</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.429" end="01:54:58.059" style="s2">say wow if I could get the seven people</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.639" end="01:55:00.249" style="s2">who have the best insight on on AI to</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.059" end="01:55:02.530" style="s2">actually enter into a truly sovereign</p>

<p begin="01:55:07.030" end="01:55:10.959" style="s2">other guys and I can do something which</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.159" end="01:55:12.670" style="s2">would then have massively asymmetric</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.959" end="01:55:14.530" style="s2">competitive advantage in game a which</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.670" end="01:55:16.269" style="s2">are yours to a whole lot more money than</p>

<p begin="01:55:16.269" end="01:55:21.729" style="s2">clothes so that&#39;s the thing to be</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.670" end="01:55:23.170" style="s2">thinking about I like it a lot because</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.729" end="01:55:26.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a good you know it&#39;s to what I was</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.170" end="01:55:28.809" style="s2">describing as smart and effective and</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.170" end="01:55:31.780" style="s2">intentional parasitism of game a right</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.809" end="01:55:33.789" style="s2">will essentially create things that</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.780" end="01:55:35.709" style="s2">allow us to pull energy out of game a to</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.789" end="01:55:37.719" style="s2">build more game B to pull more energy</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.709" end="01:55:39.489" style="s2">out of game a and if I do that right and</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.719" end="01:55:41.829" style="s2">if the R is greater than one</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.489" end="01:55:43.659" style="s2">eventually game B gets bigger than game</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.829" end="01:55:45.579" style="s2">a however I&#39;m gonna push back a little</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.659" end="01:55:47.110" style="s2">bit or at least put a pruning I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.579" end="01:55:49.150" style="s2">propose a pruning role let me get your</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.110" end="01:55:51.329" style="s2">reaction to this you talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.150" end="01:55:53.320" style="s2">distributed decentralized autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.329" end="01:55:55.090" style="s2">organizations you didn&#39;t name them but</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.320" end="01:55:57.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what we were I think alluding to</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.090" end="01:56:01.150" style="s2">from the blockchain world and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.130" end="01:56:05.320" style="s2">suggest that if conviviality is central</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.150" end="01:56:08.170" style="s2">to game B that provides a very hard</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.320" end="01:56:09.909" style="s2">pruning rule which is that a proto B has</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.170" end="01:56:12.309" style="s2">to be geographically anchored as a</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.909" end="01:56:14.619" style="s2">face-to-face community which constrains</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.309" end="01:56:17.590" style="s2">the possibility space for the early</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.619" end="01:56:19.150" style="s2">proto B&#39;s I think you&#39;re you&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.590" end="01:56:20.499" style="s2">you&#39;re quite likely right but not</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.150" end="01:56:23.440" style="s2">necessarily completely right so I think</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.499" end="01:56:25.479" style="s2">there&#39;s this at least two variations on</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.440" end="01:56:28.239" style="s2">that theme that I&#39;ve seen I would say</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.479" end="01:56:30.789" style="s2">for sure embodied relationship is</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.239" end="01:56:33.969" style="s2">central so there&#39;s very little wiggle</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.789" end="01:56:36.459" style="s2">room on that so no anchored physical</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.969" end="01:56:38.709" style="s2">communities living together 24/7 is is</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.459" end="01:56:40.690" style="s2">going to be the lifeblood of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.709" end="01:56:42.630" style="s2">but I noticed at least two other things</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.690" end="01:56:43.869" style="s2">that definitely seem to work one is</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.630" end="01:56:46.630" style="s2">episodic</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.869" end="01:56:48.459" style="s2">physical relationship so there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.630" end="01:56:51.369" style="s2">huge difference from me collaborating</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.459" end="01:56:52.720" style="s2">with a and a digital avatar out in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.369" end="01:56:55.390" style="s2">world that I&#39;ve never met</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.720" end="01:56:58.060" style="s2">and spending a week with somebody an</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.390" end="01:57:00.490" style="s2">embodied space and then maintaining the</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.060" end="01:57:02.110" style="s2">relationship through through virtual</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.490" end="01:57:03.580" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s that difference is a real</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.110" end="01:57:05.610" style="s2">difference and if I if I think about</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.580" end="01:57:08.770" style="s2">that as in terms of a flow like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.610" end="01:57:10.990" style="s2">once a quarter or twice a year or once a</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.770" end="01:57:13.120" style="s2">month being in physical proximity and</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.990" end="01:57:14.500" style="s2">building the strong bonds and the deeper</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.120" end="01:57:17.620" style="s2">sense of relationality and</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.500" end="01:57:19.660" style="s2">meaningfulness and then doing other work</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.620" end="01:57:20.740" style="s2">at a virtual level there may be</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.660" end="01:57:23.020" style="s2">something there where you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.740" end="01:57:25.960" style="s2">maintain continuity of coherence while</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.020" end="01:57:28.120" style="s2">still getting the the advantage of a</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.960" end="01:57:30.430" style="s2">much wider footprint of what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.120" end="01:57:32.050" style="s2">now and that&#39;s once that&#39;s one piece I</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.430" end="01:57:33.790" style="s2">have reason to believe that&#39;s true like</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.050" end="01:57:35.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve definitely noticed that for example</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.790" end="01:57:38.470" style="s2">you and I have not met in person now for</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.860" end="01:57:40.480" style="s2">years but because we really did do a lot</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.470" end="01:57:42.160" style="s2">of work in person our virtual</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.480" end="01:57:45.670" style="s2">relationship is just a lot stronger and</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.160" end="01:57:47.830" style="s2">faster and then the other one is the</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.670" end="01:57:49.930" style="s2">ability to engage in collaboration</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.830" end="01:57:52.660" style="s2">between groups that are themselves</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.930" end="01:57:54.700" style="s2">anchoring right so there&#39;s this this</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.660" end="01:57:56.920" style="s2">mutual synergy the game be groups have</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.700" end="01:57:58.180" style="s2">at least in principle a much higher</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.920" end="01:57:59.770" style="s2">level to engage in distributed</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.180" end="01:58:02.580" style="s2">collaboration so it may be the case that</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.770" end="01:58:06.220" style="s2">it&#39;s actually you know Group one is in</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.580" end="01:58:08.710" style="s2">either the Santa Cruz forest and Group</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.220" end="01:58:10.480" style="s2">two is in southern France and both</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.710" end="01:58:12.330" style="s2">groups are like really rich convivial</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.480" end="01:58:15.910" style="s2">communities that are their own thing and</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.330" end="01:58:17.920" style="s2">the groups are are collaborating largely</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.910" end="01:58:19.450" style="s2">virtually but they&#39;re at nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.920" end="01:58:20.740" style="s2">able to be synergistic with each other</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.450" end="01:58:21.880" style="s2">and because they&#39;re able to be</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.740" end="01:58:23.590" style="s2">synergistic with each other</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.880" end="01:58:25.870" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the velocity of</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.590" end="01:58:28.240" style="s2">innovation that is actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.870" end="01:58:29.530" style="s2">generative so that&#39;s a third piece to</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.240" end="01:58:31.960" style="s2">add to the equation so just to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.530" end="01:58:33.730" style="s2">make the story richer yeah that was my</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.960" end="01:58:36.550" style="s2">exact next point that you know I would</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.730" end="01:58:38.590" style="s2">expect there to be multiple per Toby&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.550" end="01:58:40.540" style="s2">and each one will be different initially</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.590" end="01:58:41.980" style="s2">they&#39;ll have different selections</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.540" end="01:58:43.810" style="s2">amongst the piece parts that they</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.980" end="01:58:45.490" style="s2">incorporate and they&#39;ll even choose</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.810" end="01:58:47.920" style="s2">different versions of the piece parts</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.490" end="01:58:49.510" style="s2">that they do incorporate and that if</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.920" end="01:58:53.380" style="s2">they&#39;re if there really is a holistic</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.510" end="01:58:57.160" style="s2">game be that they can interact at long</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.380" end="01:58:59.260" style="s2">range via online tourism and what I</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.160" end="01:59:00.850" style="s2">would call refugees right people who</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.260" end="01:59:03.610" style="s2">let&#39;s say they&#39;re in the South of France</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.850" end="01:59:05.200" style="s2">game be convivial community but they</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.610" end="01:59:06.880" style="s2">find that it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.200" end="01:59:10.180" style="s2">isn&#39;t really right for them personally</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.880" end="01:59:12.640" style="s2">but from what they&#39;ve heard the Santa</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.180" end="01:59:14.080" style="s2">Cruz one sounds more like to their taste</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.640" end="01:59:16.540" style="s2">so they say well like I&#39;m gonna leave</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.080" end="01:59:18.940" style="s2">southern France and move to the Santa</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.540" end="01:59:20.440" style="s2">Cruz community and so this way that of</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.940" end="01:59:22.780" style="s2">interactions will happen at all these</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.440" end="01:59:25.810" style="s2">levels simultaneously and that together</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.780" end="01:59:27.820" style="s2">this cloud of proto bees is what will</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.810" end="01:59:29.620" style="s2">take game B forward to the next level</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.820" end="01:59:30.970" style="s2">and some of the perot bees will fail in</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.620" end="01:59:33.940" style="s2">fact I hope some of them do right</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.970" end="01:59:35.380" style="s2">evolution moves forward by failure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.940" end="01:59:37.180" style="s2">and I think you it&#39;s funny because we</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.380" end="01:59:38.200" style="s2">can think about almost like meta failure</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.180" end="01:59:41.140" style="s2">because we&#39;re now we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.200" end="01:59:43.690" style="s2">groups so the proto B fails but the</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.140" end="01:59:45.490" style="s2">individuals involved actually carry in</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.690" end="01:59:46.900" style="s2">themselves the deep learning that you</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.490" end="01:59:49.090" style="s2">can only really get when something</p>

<p begin="01:59:49.090" end="01:59:52.420" style="s2">they bring that which would now be</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.110" end="01:59:54.070" style="s2">called wisdom they can bring that back</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.420" end="01:59:55.510" style="s2">out now by the way think about that</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.070" end="01:59:57.220" style="s2">that&#39;s fun distinction as I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.510" end="02:00:00.280" style="s2">about it there&#39;s there&#39;s wisdom in this</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.220" end="02:00:02.050" style="s2">trauma and it&#39;s crucial but as these</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.280" end="02:00:03.340" style="s2">things fail they fail in the direction</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.050" end="02:00:04.840" style="s2">of wisdom and not in the direction of</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.340" end="02:00:06.760" style="s2">trauma so we have to actually give</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.840" end="02:00:09.880" style="s2">ourselves permission to fail even though</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.760" end="02:00:10.270" style="s2">we&#39;re also very committed I&#39;m making it</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.880" end="02:00:12.190" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.270" end="02:00:14.650" style="s2">very much like the adventure concept of</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.190" end="02:00:16.450" style="s2">honorable failures right yeah honorable</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.650" end="02:00:18.130" style="s2">failure exactly fail for the right</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.450" end="02:00:19.240" style="s2">reason not the wrong reason the reason</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.130" end="02:00:20.830" style="s2">it you know there was some just</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.240" end="02:00:22.780" style="s2">something you couldn&#39;t have seen from</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.830" end="02:00:25.240" style="s2">where you started don&#39;t fail because you</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.780" end="02:00:26.800" style="s2">had a toxic culture and we&#39;re riven with</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.240" end="02:00:29.320" style="s2">in fighting right and then and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.800" end="02:00:31.180" style="s2">recognize that this makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.320" end="02:00:33.250" style="s2">when you&#39;re part of a larger whole like</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.180" end="02:00:35.020" style="s2">honorable failure and venture has this</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.250" end="02:00:38.260" style="s2">really weird thing where clearly the</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.020" end="02:00:39.970" style="s2">team failed and there&#39;s very little renu</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.260" end="02:00:42.580" style="s2">marae ssin that they get from the larger</p>

<p begin="02:00:45.160" end="02:00:50.140" style="s2">furthers the larger progress of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.530" end="02:00:51.760" style="s2">larger game be effort there is something</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.140" end="02:00:54.070" style="s2">very real about the degree to which that</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.760" end="02:00:56.200" style="s2">will flow back to you like certainly if</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.070" end="02:00:57.340" style="s2">the story I&#39;m telling us correct to the</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.200" end="02:00:58.870" style="s2">degree to which you&#39;ve furthered the</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.340" end="02:01:00.340" style="s2">possibility of game B happening at all</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.870" end="02:01:02.740" style="s2">and therefore a void in the katashi of</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.340" end="02:01:03.970" style="s2">game a you know hallelujah and you</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.740" end="02:01:06.940" style="s2">benefit from that as much as everybody</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.970" end="02:01:10.090" style="s2">else but even more to the very nature of</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.940" end="02:01:11.590" style="s2">game B there&#39;s something about the sorry</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.090" end="02:01:13.060" style="s2">I just realize we see this adventure all</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.590" end="02:01:14.890" style="s2">the time like it&#39;s so it&#39;s remember like</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.060" end="02:01:16.480" style="s2">this looking value story up I&#39;d always</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.890" end="02:01:17.710" style="s2">rather hire somebody who&#39;s already been</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.480" end="02:01:19.100" style="s2">part of two failed startups because</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.710" end="02:01:20.930" style="s2">there&#39;s things that they&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.100" end="02:01:22.280" style="s2">absolutely same kind of idea like if</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.930" end="02:01:23.390" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually been through two proto</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.280" end="02:01:24.800" style="s2">B&#39;s that have failed but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.390" end="02:01:27.230" style="s2">honorably failed and you&#39;ve grown in</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.800" end="02:01:28.220" style="s2">wisdom I kind of really want you to be</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.230" end="02:01:29.300" style="s2">part of my proto because they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.220" end="02:01:30.650" style="s2">likelihood that you&#39;re gonna be bringing</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.300" end="02:01:32.570" style="s2">some experience to this is pretty hot</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.650" end="02:01:34.220" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.570" end="02:01:36.680" style="s2">well I think that&#39;s probably as much as</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.220" end="02:01:39.050" style="s2">we have time for today we covered some</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.680" end="02:01:41.270" style="s2">amazing ground I think this will help</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.050" end="02:01:43.280" style="s2">people who will keep asking the question</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.270" end="02:01:44.960" style="s2">well what exactly is game B it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.280" end="02:01:49.010" style="s2">answer that question but I believe it to</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.960" end="02:01:50.750" style="s2">put a lot of meat on those bones my my</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.010" end="02:01:53.540" style="s2">thing that I just put out there for for</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.750" end="02:01:55.580" style="s2">anybody who feels unsatisfied with the</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.540" end="02:01:58.040" style="s2">conversation and either in terms of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.580" end="02:02:01.430" style="s2">scope or the quality is that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.040" end="02:02:04.310" style="s2">a pretty reasonable assessment but just</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.430" end="02:02:06.020" style="s2">an invitation to recognize that if you</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.310" end="02:02:08.630" style="s2">look at the science of anything let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.020" end="02:02:10.400" style="s2">just go with lasers you know the the</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.630" end="02:02:12.830" style="s2">underlying deep physics that gave rise</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.400" end="02:02:14.780" style="s2">to the laser I think was 1919 and the</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.830" end="02:02:16.730" style="s2">very specific physics that actually</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.780" end="02:02:18.110" style="s2">describe the specific companion what it</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.730" end="02:02:22.550" style="s2">was required to be a laser was I think</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.110" end="02:02:24.380" style="s2">1953 which was a long time and then the</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.550" end="02:02:26.720" style="s2">actual physical implementation of a real</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.380" end="02:02:29.570" style="s2">live laser wasn&#39;t for another like seven</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.720" end="02:02:32.780" style="s2">to ten years so and that was with</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.570" end="02:02:34.940" style="s2">massively funded research industrial</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.780" end="02:02:37.220" style="s2">labs like you know Bell Labs working on</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.940" end="02:02:40.280" style="s2">this kind of a project and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.220" end="02:02:42.110" style="s2">narrow project right so that was a good</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.280" end="02:02:43.850" style="s2">sense of the the challenge in the scope</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.110" end="02:02:45.380" style="s2">of that kind of a deal and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.850" end="02:02:48.290" style="s2">trying to do is a whole lot harder and</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.380" end="02:02:50.990" style="s2">with a whole lot less resource so yes</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.290" end="02:02:52.880" style="s2">you were quite right in the however long</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.990" end="02:02:54.890" style="s2">we just spent on this conversation we</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.880" end="02:02:57.010" style="s2">barely scratched the surface of even a</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.890" end="02:02:59.240" style="s2">very small number of these deep things</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.010" end="02:03:01.160" style="s2">probably didn&#39;t do a very good job on</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.240" end="02:03:02.690" style="s2">any of them and probably had a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.160" end="02:03:04.640" style="s2">cringe-worthy efforts even the ones we</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.690" end="02:03:07.100" style="s2">did it mediocre job at nonetheless</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.640" end="02:03:09.170" style="s2">hopefully we move the game forward at</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.100" end="02:03:11.900" style="s2">least a little bit and the next one can</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.170" end="02:03:13.100" style="s2">be better yeah I think that&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.900" end="02:03:14.930" style="s2">way to describe it and we&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.100" end="02:03:17.960" style="s2">have you back another month or two and</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.930" end="02:03:20.830" style="s2">take the conversation further alright</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.960" end="02:03:20.830" style="s2">doc you later man</p>
