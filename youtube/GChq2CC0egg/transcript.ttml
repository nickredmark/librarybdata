<p begin="00:00:03.780" end="00:00:09.330" style="s2">is an author how do you think the name</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.589" end="00:00:12.030" style="s2">is title this book&#39;s right now but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.330" end="00:00:13.410" style="s2">should know I&#39;ve read a few of them no</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.030" end="00:00:15.859" style="s2">one&#39;s called like spontaneous evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.410" end="00:00:18.510" style="s2">with one is the biology of belief and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.859" end="00:00:22.010" style="s2">how much the mind-body is connected and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.510" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">he has a degree in cellular biology but</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.010" end="00:00:27.300" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have health issues he&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">as far as I know I read the book like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.300" end="00:00:32.309" style="s2">decade ago had health issues and when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">googled it didn&#39;t just show up so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.309" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">not definitely not front and center of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">his mission on the planet and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:41.540" style="s2">concept I mean I when I was going</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">through all of my health struggles and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.540" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">eating fighting I had brain tumors and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">then you need to get surgery and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">then growing back knee and get radiation</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:53.370" style="s2">he can get surgery on a different one</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:55.350" style="s2">again there was a part of me that felt</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">like a failure because I wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.350" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">heal them on my own because I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">able to think and make them go away</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">because I wasn&#39;t able to like tap into</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">that power of the mind-body connection</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">and I believed in the mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">connection I actually think I do make my</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">conditions worse when I focus on them in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:12.990" style="s2">a negative way but I don&#39;t think I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">just reverse them the other way it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.990" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">equivalent of like asking someone not to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">think about an elephant and then of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">course that&#39;s all you&#39;re gonna think</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.259" style="s2">about like if you haven&#39;t been through</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:23.720" style="s2">the struggle how would you possibly know</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.259" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">how to think yourself out of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.720" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">it&#39;s very different like all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">things all of the self-help community</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">all of the like all of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">then I got even healthier how the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">do you know you did you&#39;re healthy you</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you had more energy like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">you don&#39;t think that&#39;s a freakin placebo</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">effect just makes me angry this is like</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">all of your doctors everyone I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:52.409" style="s2">tweeted this and discussing with your</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:55.530" style="s2">friends on Facebook but Gynaecologists</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.409" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">used to be male doctors like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.530" end="00:01:57.990" style="s2">percent of them are male doctors because</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">a hundred percent of doctors were male</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.990" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">and now that women can be doctors it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">pretty much flipped like nearly a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">hundred percent of the gynecologists</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">coming out of med school are women</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">because women want to see women for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:16.349" style="s2">particular issue and rightfully on</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:19.769" style="s2">sadly so but as a person who suffers</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.349" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">with chronic illness with mental issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.769" end="00:02:23.819" style="s2">with any of that I want a doctor who</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:25.409" style="s2">understands like just a fraction just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.819" end="00:02:26.970" style="s2">little bit like who isn&#39;t a Type A</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.409" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">personality who and just pushed through</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.970" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">everything who works like 16-hour days</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">and that&#39;s normal and like into in</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">through medical school it&#39;s like no I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:38.189" style="s2">want someone who struggles with mental</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">health and and is or head like God has</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.189" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">gotten over it if that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">someone who&#39;s had health issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:46.280" style="s2">past and now understands what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">to be a patient in the medical community</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.280" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">just like the ableism that&#39;s rampant</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like my I just I I realize</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:55.790" style="s2">that I definitely an anchor and like</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a learning here it&#39;ll come but</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.790" end="00:03:00.659" style="s2">the whole thing and I felt it in my life</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:02.489" style="s2">is like okay everything has to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.659" end="00:03:04.409" style="s2">perfect like I can eat perfect organic</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.489" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">food and my house needs to be clean and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.409" end="00:03:10.769" style="s2">organized and I need to be presentable</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">and because he can&#39;t tell I fall short</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.769" end="00:03:13.439" style="s2">on all of those things like my house</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">especially now that I have chronic</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.439" end="00:03:17.690" style="s2">fatigue it&#39;s like oh yeah my house</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">disaster I&#39;m thought at the time me</p>
