<p begin="00:00:13.349" end="00:00:21.689" style="s2">known for for many years and Stephen is</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.590" end="00:00:24.510" style="s2">a baker a singer-songwriter and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.689" end="00:00:27.660" style="s2">philosopher I would say and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.510" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">having this very long conversation over</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.660" end="00:00:34.290" style="s2">extended time and influencing each other</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">in various ways and I wanted to have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.290" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">conversation because I think Stephen has</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">a few things to say so we were just</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:41.820" style="s2">talking off mic and you were telling me</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">that there was something particularly</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">you wanted to say and related to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">say some of the discussions that have</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">been going on about about religion and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">intellectual dark web and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">ideas that are in the air today so speak</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:09.869" style="s2">Stephen tell me what what is it that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:13.710" style="s2">have to say to us first of all hello</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.869" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">Andrew even though we just spoke the I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.710" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">want to talk about small groups first of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">all I hear 20 years ago I read Bern Asia</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">rare too shocked me into realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">there was no such thing as collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">intelligence and that we had to figure</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:32.780" style="s2">out and I was on a new island on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">political left and I had to it was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.780" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">embark on a process of trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">out how how we were to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">well-being for you know the so called</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">lower class for people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">necessarily fit into the world of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">success and and and then that was a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">that it was a very long journey and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">it it was a very confusing one but I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">came up with this idea about 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">ago now which was that it was a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:12.989" style="s2">an idea of democratic reform and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">you&#39;ll have to sort of bear with me for</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.989" end="00:02:16.620" style="s2">a minute</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">and you&#39;re in imagine Election Day is on</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.620" end="00:02:21.860" style="s2">May the second and it&#39;s it&#39;s November so</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">Election Day is in six months time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.860" end="00:02:28.860" style="s2">you have you have as a pass to form a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">small group so you may former small</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.860" end="00:02:33.020" style="s2">particular you already know or may see</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:36.990" style="s2">with people you&#39;ve never met before and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.020" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">you you get to know them you talk you</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.990" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">could you agree and you disagree</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">it might and you might hang out played</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">darts or whatever or watch sports games</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:49.830" style="s2">on television or way just get to know</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:52.470" style="s2">each other and you you you know that on</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.830" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">Election Day you have one track and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.470" end="00:02:57.240" style="s2">is to choose a leader out of that small</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:03:01.710" style="s2">group but the group is small enough so</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.240" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">that each member of the group knows the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.710" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">other member personally and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:09.750" style="s2">pretty small group actually my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">is that once you get above I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.750" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">eight or nine it just gets too big and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:16.470" style="s2">people have a tendency to split a group</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">into two and to not make an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.470" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">get to know everybody in the group I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">been thinking about this as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:26.790" style="s2">think you can see this in you know in</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">all kinds of different models like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.790" end="00:03:32.850" style="s2">football game or a rock concert or you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.400" style="s2">have a small group and and this small</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.850" end="00:03:40.170" style="s2">group is is dynamic it&#39;s and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:42.930" style="s2">is in relation to each each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.170" end="00:03:44.610" style="s2">in a real way rather than an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.930" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">way and if it gets bigger than that then</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.610" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">it&#39;s uncomfortable or does that make any</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">sense oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:52.500" style="s2">like I&#39;ve imagined like a big arena or</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">some sporting event has happened fifty</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.500" end="00:03:56.700" style="s2">thousand people in an arena my feelings</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">that the arena is full of small groups</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.700" end="00:04:01.050" style="s2">and so 50,000 people kind of doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:03.030" style="s2">make sense and often it they filed in</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.050" end="00:04:05.310" style="s2">just stupid collective behavior you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.030" end="00:04:08.970" style="s2">I think mobs and hooliganism and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.310" end="00:04:11.550" style="s2">like that but but in when it&#39;s coherent</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.970" end="00:04:13.769" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a bunch of small groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.550" end="00:04:15.690" style="s2">going to see a match and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.769" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">actually this deep clarity inside this</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.690" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">large crowd and they and and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:24.660" style="s2">a there&#39;s a potential for that large</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">crowd to actually relate as small groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.660" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">to other small groups and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:30.870" style="s2">this deep there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:34.680" style="s2">we have this into intuition for behaving</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.870" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">in that way and we tend to but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.680" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">skipping I&#39;m skipping our I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:39.689" style="s2">get to that later that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:42.030" style="s2">that&#39;s more complex things but anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.689" end="00:04:43.770" style="s2">it&#39;s Election Day is coming up and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.030" end="00:04:46.620" style="s2">have one tab and that&#39;s to choose a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.770" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">leader and what happens is the level one</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.620" end="00:04:51.659" style="s2">election has just occurred and so a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.110" end="00:04:54.569" style="s2">level one leadership let&#39;s let&#39;s say for</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.659" end="00:04:56.129" style="s2">argument&#39;s sake and just for</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.569" end="00:04:59.849" style="s2">mathematical simplicity that the groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.129" end="00:05:04.620" style="s2">have to have ten members so so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.849" end="00:05:06.810" style="s2">just chosen leader leader everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.620" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">your society on Election Day has just</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.810" end="00:05:12.930" style="s2">chosen a level one leader and that means</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">that think the the group has ten members</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.930" end="00:05:18.409" style="s2">that means that 90% of the population</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.990" end="00:05:20.370" style="s2">has just made there only</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.409" end="00:05:23.069" style="s2">ninety percent of the electorate those</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.370" end="00:05:25.590" style="s2">who vote have just made their only vote</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.069" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">and what happens is this is in my Oh me</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.590" end="00:05:31.229" style="s2">of my imagination doesn&#39;t exist anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">the level one leaders move up to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.229" end="00:05:36.599" style="s2">level two and then form another small</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:37.949" style="s2">group of ten and they have an extended</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.599" end="00:05:39.270" style="s2">period of time they have the former</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.949" end="00:05:41.969" style="s2">small group gotta get to know each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.270" end="00:05:44.849" style="s2">argue agree disagree and their whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.969" end="00:05:47.490" style="s2">purpose at after a certain period of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.849" end="00:05:50.190" style="s2">time level to election day is to choose</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.490" end="00:05:52.770" style="s2">a leader of that small group and so on</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.190" end="00:05:54.599" style="s2">and so forth the level three leaders to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.770" end="00:05:57.089" style="s2">a level two litre represents 100 people</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.599" end="00:05:59.939" style="s2">level three and out of these and level</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.089" end="00:06:02.339" style="s2">six represents a million etc and so when</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.939" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">you think about you know if you think in</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.339" end="00:06:08.839" style="s2">terms of groups of ten it only takes ten</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:11.279" style="s2">levels to represent the entire planet</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.839" end="00:06:12.779" style="s2">and you know it probably even less</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.279" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">because not everybody votes you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.779" end="00:06:17.639" style="s2">like chill kids don&#39;t both and other</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.370" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">people don&#39;t vote anyway so so can I</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.639" end="00:06:21.539" style="s2">just stop you for a sec so I understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">so you want your drink you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.539" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">about reorganizing democracy based on</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:27.839" style="s2">small groups in some sense right right</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.800" end="00:06:30.779" style="s2">but not only that it&#39;s at the bottom and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.839" end="00:06:33.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a matter it&#39;s a it&#39;s a vision</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.779" end="00:06:34.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a vision for optimizing the</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.770" end="00:06:40.500" style="s2">in other words optimizing the voice of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.680" end="00:06:42.600" style="s2">everybody so that everybody who votes</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.500" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">both for someone they know personally</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.600" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">and nobody ever votes for someone that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:49.560" style="s2">they don&#39;t know person it&#39;s always an</p>

<p begin="00:07:19.320" end="00:07:22.980" style="s2">know personally so they really feel that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:24.840" style="s2">the boat is valuable and then we feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.980" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">that it counts now the only vote want</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.840" end="00:07:28.980" style="s2">this amazed this would be out of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:32.250" style="s2">little vision so you want to go for your</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.980" end="00:07:33.990" style="s2">level more leader then at level I for</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.250" end="00:07:36.540" style="s2">level six might be the mayor of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.990" end="00:07:38.940" style="s2">City for example and level seven might</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.940" end="00:07:41.880" style="s2">so the cream the cream your of your</p>

<p begin="00:07:44.910" end="00:07:47.940" style="s2">few levels higher up it would be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:51.390" style="s2">Prime Minister you know Mike I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.940" end="00:07:52.770" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna and if so you&#39;ve only only</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.390" end="00:07:56.010" style="s2">vote once but you see that certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.770" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">levels represent different different</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:02.460" style="s2">anyway this was just it so just just let</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.140" end="00:08:04.140" style="s2">me stop you there maybe this would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.460" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">easier to understand if we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.140" end="00:08:08.820" style="s2">the problematic right of how the system</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">is today like why is the system not</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.820" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">working today and and why are you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:17.550" style="s2">offering this alternate model</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:20.130" style="s2">what are you criticizing in the system</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.550" end="00:08:23.070" style="s2">as it is today in order to offer this</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.130" end="00:08:26.120" style="s2">model is it is it that the lack of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.070" end="00:08:29.970" style="s2">say I guess this this whole problem that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.120" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">of people being left behind or being</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.970" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">having not having a voice or being let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">say vote becomes something so abstract</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.250" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t mean anything and people</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:43.820" style="s2">become completely cynical about about</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.250" end="00:08:47.010" style="s2">their society this is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.820" end="00:08:48.270" style="s2">think I think all of Western democracies</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.010" end="00:08:51.870" style="s2">right now are heading towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">oligarchies which means that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.870" end="00:08:55.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a an elite group at</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.670" style="s2">let&#39;s remain this elite group there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.809" end="00:08:59.889" style="s2">that you know the corporations are in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.670" end="00:09:02.049" style="s2">are in bed basically politicians and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.889" end="00:09:05.649" style="s2">there&#39;s this there&#39;s this exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.049" end="00:09:07.779" style="s2">group who and it&#39;s who run things and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.649" end="00:09:10.119" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult if you&#39;re not inside</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.779" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">that group to access and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.119" end="00:09:14.109" style="s2">sort of a privileged and and there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:15.759" style="s2">think we we have over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.109" end="00:09:17.679" style="s2">decades developed a deep resentment of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.759" end="00:09:20.189" style="s2">over this and the and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.679" end="00:09:24.100" style="s2">ultimate reason this just happened is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.189" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">after beginning and I think in the 1940s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.100" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">and you know really beginning early in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.720" end="00:09:29.619" style="s2">the 20th century the unions became</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:32.350" style="s2">increasingly powerful by the time the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.619" end="00:09:36.639" style="s2">fifties arrived they were established</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.350" end="00:09:38.790" style="s2">and there was a period of where we had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.639" end="00:09:42.249" style="s2">we had a sense that the lower classes</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.790" end="00:09:44.290" style="s2">had a voice through I think primarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.249" end="00:09:46.660" style="s2">through the Union but the Union was</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.290" end="00:09:48.910" style="s2">basically broken in the 1980s I think by</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.660" end="00:09:50.939" style="s2">reaganism and it was even more so it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.910" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">even broken more progressively by</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.939" end="00:09:56.559" style="s2">globalization in 1990 things to me and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.470" end="00:09:58.989" style="s2">so people have had this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.559" end="00:10:00.129" style="s2">economic vulnerability ever since but</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.989" end="00:10:03.489" style="s2">that book got me thinking right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.129" end="00:10:06.339" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s saying that there</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.489" end="00:10:08.439" style="s2">needs to be a strong voice on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.339" end="00:10:10.779" style="s2">which is sort of you know when you hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.439" end="00:10:13.029" style="s2">Peterson you you get the impression that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.779" end="00:10:14.619" style="s2">we need to reinstate hierarchies or</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.029" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">something and hierarchies are important</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.619" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">then we have to go back to hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:23.350" style="s2">and respect hierarchies or respect to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:27.249" style="s2">balance at least between you know chaos</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.350" end="00:10:28.839" style="s2">and order in the society whereas you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.249" end="00:10:31.209" style="s2">saying something different you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.839" end="00:10:34.869" style="s2">you&#39;re actually you&#39;re actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.209" end="00:10:38.139" style="s2">to let&#39;s say Brit valorize the left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.869" end="00:10:40.569" style="s2">politics in a way that is different from</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.139" end="00:10:44.499" style="s2">the left-wing now which is all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.569" end="00:10:47.589" style="s2">identity politics and let&#39;s say you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.499" end="00:10:50.619" style="s2">resentment politics and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.589" end="00:10:52.329" style="s2">thing absolutely well the small group</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.619" end="00:10:54.730" style="s2">the small group circumvents to identity</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.329" end="00:10:56.289" style="s2">politics because we we have to get along</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.730" end="00:10:58.149" style="s2">with it with with the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.289" end="00:10:59.919" style="s2">group and we have to choose a leader and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.149" end="00:11:02.889" style="s2">the leader moves on moves on ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.919" end="00:11:04.689" style="s2">we do so I mean we can I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.889" end="00:11:06.279" style="s2">it&#39;s not foolproof it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.689" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">corruptible and it&#39;s only in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.279" end="00:11:08.590" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.210" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">I want to insist that this is not this</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.590" end="00:11:13.750" style="s2">only exists as an ideal and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:15.370" style="s2">why I want to talk about I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.750" end="00:11:17.290" style="s2">introduce because it actually accessed</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.370" end="00:11:19.860" style="s2">me to a larger potential understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.290" end="00:11:23.320" style="s2">of how the world works but but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.860" end="00:11:26.170" style="s2">back to when you mentioned Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.320" end="00:11:28.210" style="s2">Peterson he I think his view on I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.170" end="00:11:29.380" style="s2">think if he thinks we should return to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.210" end="00:11:30.670" style="s2">hierarchy see I think he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.380" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">hierarchies are just something very</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.670" end="00:11:38.080" style="s2">basic to us and the other to him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:40.360" style="s2">not he&#39;s not proposing our keys she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.080" end="00:11:43.300" style="s2">simply saying well the left sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.360" end="00:11:45.630" style="s2">feels like he&#39;s valorizing hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.300" end="00:11:48.100" style="s2">and they hate that because the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.630" end="00:11:50.200" style="s2">hierarchies in their opinion are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.100" end="00:11:53.020" style="s2">root of all evil right and hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.200" end="00:11:54.610" style="s2">can be extremely evil obviously but what</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.020" end="00:11:56.680" style="s2">he&#39;s saying there they&#39;re deep they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.610" end="00:11:58.450" style="s2">part of the structure even of our brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.680" end="00:12:00.970" style="s2">right so we&#39;re gonna have to work within</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.450" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">the hierarchies to solve these problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.970" end="00:12:05.710" style="s2">so we can&#39;t just do away with them right</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:07.480" style="s2">okay so given given that I&#39;ve accepted</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.710" end="00:12:09.730" style="s2">that Peters Peterson&#39;s arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.480" end="00:12:11.710" style="s2">are keys are inevitable then what do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.730" end="00:12:16.210" style="s2">get what is the left do with them and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.710" end="00:12:19.660" style="s2">that&#39;s ours that&#39;s what the left does</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.210" end="00:12:22.180" style="s2">with them is figure out a way for people</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.660" end="00:12:25.900" style="s2">at the bottom of those hierarchies to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.180" end="00:12:29.050" style="s2">have a voice and and so no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.900" end="00:12:32.110" style="s2">exactly right and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.050" end="00:12:34.210" style="s2">what I what I just articulated at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.110" end="00:12:36.460" style="s2">in ideal form now when the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.210" end="00:12:38.710" style="s2">ideas it&#39;s the same problems utopianism</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.460" end="00:12:41.500" style="s2">you know if you try it it just might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.710" end="00:12:44.620" style="s2">an absolute disaster so I know damn well</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.500" end="00:12:47.050" style="s2">that this only exists in as an ideal and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.620" end="00:12:49.420" style="s2">and if it if it is to be tried it can</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.050" end="00:12:52.300" style="s2">only be tried in small pilot project</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.420" end="00:12:54.550" style="s2">well on one hand it&#39;s an ideal but on</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.300" end="00:12:58.690" style="s2">the other hand it&#39;s also perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.550" end="00:13:00.910" style="s2">return to forms which are quite old you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.690" end="00:13:03.400" style="s2">know yeah well you know for example a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.910" end="00:13:05.290" style="s2">church is a very small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.400" end="00:13:07.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not a big group of people so</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.290" end="00:13:09.160" style="s2">everybody knows each other and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.000" end="00:13:10.330" style="s2">they shake hands in church there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.160" end="00:13:12.340" style="s2">insistence that there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.330" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">between the people in the church right</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.340" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">that and when it gets too big it loses</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:21.130" style="s2">its soul so to speak like it loses its</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:25.930" style="s2">you know meaning and identity</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.130" end="00:13:27.310" style="s2">so so so I think probably if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.930" end="00:13:29.800" style="s2">something true and what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.310" end="00:13:33.010" style="s2">it&#39;s probably there&#39;s probably some deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.800" end="00:13:36.070" style="s2">you know structures which mirror that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.010" end="00:13:37.480" style="s2">does that make him say that exactly I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.070" end="00:13:39.070" style="s2">just want to get on with that and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.480" end="00:13:40.540" style="s2">basically anticipate it what I was going</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.070" end="00:13:42.910" style="s2">to talk about so I was really excited</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.540" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">about this as a vision of economic</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.910" end="00:13:52.810" style="s2">reform and then I stopped thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:54.220" style="s2">it and I and and it&#39;s just it disappears</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.810" end="00:13:55.510" style="s2">from my mind and probably for a long</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.220" end="00:13:57.850" style="s2">time maybe couple years something with</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.510" end="00:14:01.780" style="s2">it and then I had this other idea I own</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.850" end="00:14:03.910" style="s2">a bakery and I was and I had I had at</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.780" end="00:14:05.350" style="s2">the time I think seven employees and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.910" end="00:14:06.970" style="s2">remember I was working one night and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.350" end="00:14:08.530" style="s2">was thinking gee if I had any more</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.970" end="00:14:10.150" style="s2">employees and this I probably couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.530" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">manage it now that&#39;s just me I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.150" end="00:14:13.210" style="s2">think might someone want a little more</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:14.410" style="s2">practical normally someone&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.210" end="00:14:16.150" style="s2">practical and his personal maker</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.410" end="00:14:19.500" style="s2">probably handle a bigger place but not</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.150" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">me and that buddy then I had this moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.500" end="00:14:27.460" style="s2">this inside which is that business is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:29.980" style="s2">run it small groups and so the reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.460" end="00:14:32.230" style="s2">why the reason why I couldn&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.980" end="00:14:33.460" style="s2">myself running business with more than</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.230" end="00:14:35.800" style="s2">seven points because that&#39;s a small</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.460" end="00:14:37.870" style="s2">group it&#39;s an interpersonal group and if</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.800" end="00:14:39.520" style="s2">I was get any bigger we&#39;d have to divide</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.870" end="00:14:40.540" style="s2">into it have to hire a manager that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.520" end="00:14:42.340" style="s2">of thing in other words it has to be two</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.540" end="00:14:44.710" style="s2">levels but instead there&#39;s just spacious</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.340" end="00:14:48.130" style="s2">he&#39;s one left and and and basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.710" end="00:14:50.770" style="s2">running no I realized that that that a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.130" end="00:14:53.020" style="s2">business is a is a form of private</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.770" end="00:14:55.240" style="s2">property and property is essentially not</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.020" end="00:14:57.670" style="s2">really managed by an individual but by</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.240" end="00:15:01.180" style="s2">groups and and then it hit me that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.670" end="00:15:02.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole world his only ever run</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.180" end="00:15:05.740" style="s2">in small groups I started thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.950" end="00:15:10.080" style="s2">about the kings of the past and the king</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.740" end="00:15:12.210" style="s2">you know the or even going way back into</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.080" end="00:15:14.710" style="s2">prehistory and I&#39;m only imagining</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.210" end="00:15:17.620" style="s2">nothing with this fact this is only and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.710" end="00:15:21.300" style="s2">but imagine the alpha male of a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.620" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">he&#39;s driven he&#39;s driven to be in control</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.300" end="00:15:27.460" style="s2">well how did he exercise control of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:30.130" style="s2">given tribe tribe well what he does is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.460" end="00:15:32.500" style="s2">he first of all he he demonstrates his</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.130" end="00:15:35.140" style="s2">dominance inside the tribe but but he</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.500" end="00:15:39.610" style="s2">also picks out in the try</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.140" end="00:15:42.670" style="s2">other dominant alphas picks them out and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.610" end="00:15:44.740" style="s2">he exhibits to them that he is dominant</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.670" end="00:15:48.279" style="s2">over them but he only picked out a small</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.740" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">group Authority he chooses a small group</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.279" end="00:15:52.570" style="s2">just under him so that he can control</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:55.390" style="s2">this mongrel and that&#39;s all he needs to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.570" end="00:15:57.370" style="s2">do because what they in turn do is they</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.390" end="00:16:00.430" style="s2">do the exact same thing they choose</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.370" end="00:16:02.260" style="s2">another small group just beneath them</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.430" end="00:16:04.089" style="s2">and they control that small group so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.260" end="00:16:07.269" style="s2">world has only ever run in small groups</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.089" end="00:16:09.760" style="s2">and it it is probably only ever one from</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.269" end="00:16:11.410" style="s2">the top for a time immemorial well I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.760" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">talking about I was talking with this</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.410" end="00:16:17.380" style="s2">guy Tom I&#39;m knock about the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">dark web and there a small group and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.380" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">he was saying that he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">artistic movements and each artistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:26.140" style="s2">movement is always a small group like</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:28.269" style="s2">any anything in culture that anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.140" end="00:16:29.769" style="s2">anything that is new or added to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.269" end="00:16:36.130" style="s2">culture always begins it seems with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.769" end="00:16:38.850" style="s2">small group right what&#39;s that if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.130" end="00:16:41.709" style="s2">group gets too big it divides into two</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.850" end="00:16:43.779" style="s2">then it gets watered down and it loses</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.709" end="00:16:45.640" style="s2">its original force but there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.779" end="00:16:47.620" style="s2">these original guys in the beginning who</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.640" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">who started the happening you know like</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.620" end="00:16:53.560" style="s2">the beatniks or you know the people in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">the 20s and and in Paris or you know any</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.560" end="00:16:58.300" style="s2">any kind of well I any kind of movement</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:17:00.579" style="s2">is always it&#39;s always a few guys right</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.300" end="00:17:02.740" style="s2">it&#39;s always yeah even like while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.579" end="00:17:05.079" style="s2">talking me and you you know and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.740" end="00:17:07.089" style="s2">in communication with other people in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.079" end="00:17:09.040" style="s2">sense where we&#39;re forming sort of groups</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.089" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">of people with with similar ideas we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.040" end="00:17:12.339" style="s2">doing that right now and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:13.419" style="s2">the main group might be beater scented</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.339" end="00:17:16.390" style="s2">as gang and then there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.419" end="00:17:21.790" style="s2">little subgroups and hoping around them</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.390" end="00:17:25.799" style="s2">and because of this revolution with with</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.790" end="00:17:27.160" style="s2">a whole new set of information</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.799" end="00:17:30.130" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.160" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">no no that&#39;s and the the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.130" end="00:17:33.160" style="s2">small groups is there are disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:36.760" style="s2">with in small groups and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.160" end="00:17:39.250" style="s2">work them out and and I believe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.760" end="00:17:42.220" style="s2">that every small group once it really</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.250" end="00:17:44.260" style="s2">becomes one things develops a strong</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.220" end="00:17:46.750" style="s2">identity you develop an intuition for</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.260" end="00:17:48.790" style="s2">who the leader of it is and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.750" end="00:17:52.630" style="s2">importance of that is the leader has</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.790" end="00:17:55.720" style="s2">to override the small group and we if if</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.630" end="00:17:58.150" style="s2">it&#39;s just a bunch of people who agree</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.720" end="00:18:00.610" style="s2">and disagree it&#39;s not consensual put it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.150" end="00:18:02.230" style="s2">that way and this I think that basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.610" end="00:18:04.600" style="s2">there&#39;s something very basic to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.230" end="00:18:06.700" style="s2">human condition which is that small</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.600" end="00:18:08.230" style="s2">groups have meters and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.700" end="00:18:09.790" style="s2">members of the small group they express</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.230" end="00:18:11.410" style="s2">themselves and they may express strong</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.790" end="00:18:15.160" style="s2">disagreement with the leader but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.410" end="00:18:17.860" style="s2">leader still overrides and if he if the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.160" end="00:18:19.300" style="s2">if someone who disagrees too strongly if</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.860" end="00:18:21.580" style="s2">someone disagrees too strong even that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.300" end="00:18:25.270" style="s2">person is at risk of leaving the group</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.580" end="00:18:27.370" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind of a what holds the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.270" end="00:18:29.160" style="s2">group together in many ways is the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.370" end="00:18:34.930" style="s2">knowledge of that set it has a leader</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.160" end="00:18:36.340" style="s2">mmm-hmm I think so if we let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.930" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">look at the intellectual darkweb as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.340" end="00:18:39.730" style="s2">sort of test model you have Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:41.860" style="s2">he&#39;s obviously the leader right in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.730" end="00:18:43.930" style="s2">sense that he&#39;s the most he&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.860" end="00:18:47.140" style="s2">powerful of the group and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.930" end="00:18:48.670" style="s2">other guys have different you know often</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.140" end="00:18:50.020" style="s2">there they radically disagree with them</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.670" end="00:18:53.770" style="s2">they have different points of view but</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.020" end="00:18:55.780" style="s2">they&#39;re all kind of a group right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.770" end="00:18:57.610" style="s2">then if you get a guy like sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.780" end="00:18:58.570" style="s2">maybe he was an atheist and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.610" end="00:18:59.950" style="s2">supposed to be part of the group but</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.570" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">he&#39;s not really part of the group</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.950" end="00:19:03.400" style="s2">because he wants to be a leader himself</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:05.170" style="s2">you know and he has his own ideas which</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.400" end="00:19:08.650" style="s2">are much you know and he won&#39;t you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.170" end="00:19:10.780" style="s2">he won&#39;t adhere to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.650" end="00:19:14.260" style="s2">fully even though he&#39;s sort of a pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.780" end="00:19:15.940" style="s2">member of the group or there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.260" end="00:19:19.000" style="s2">an organic leader but there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.940" end="00:19:20.290" style="s2">there isn&#39;t necessarily a dominant</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.000" end="00:19:22.990" style="s2">leader there isn&#39;t like that this</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.290" end="00:19:25.330" style="s2">dominant idea doesn&#39;t really work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.990" end="00:19:27.490" style="s2">more like the leader isn&#39;t a isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.330" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">alpha the leader is is the guy who can</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.490" end="00:19:34.030" style="s2">now who can deal with all the other guys</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">I think we get an alpha leader might get</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.030" end="00:19:38.260" style="s2">killed right because because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">might gang gang gang up against him and</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.530" end="00:21:00.650" style="s2">sort of understand it more deeply and</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:10.310" style="s2">organically through through new</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.860" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">technology that&#39;s a real question I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.310" end="00:21:13.070" style="s2">I do think that we have an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:16.250" style="s2">first of all I really think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.070" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">everybody else and like I say groups are</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.250" end="00:21:20.120" style="s2">friends when groups of friends become</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:22.130" style="s2">too big when you have a group of fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.120" end="00:21:24.200" style="s2">friends and it just automatically splits</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.130" end="00:21:26.290" style="s2">into two and what happens is people feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.200" end="00:21:28.910" style="s2">like it&#39;s not interpersonal enough and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.290" end="00:21:30.560" style="s2">and oh this is this is something you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.910" end="00:21:33.140" style="s2">know I wanted to say that they got me</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.560" end="00:21:35.420" style="s2">thinking about what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.140" end="00:21:37.910" style="s2">person and I think arguably what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.420" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">to be a person is to be interpersonal so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.910" end="00:21:43.610" style="s2">the making of a person is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.330" end="00:21:45.380" style="s2">interpersonal process now this I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.610" end="00:21:47.540" style="s2">I&#39;ve been playing with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.380" end="00:21:49.480" style="s2">this is the female counterpart of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.540" end="00:21:52.550" style="s2">individualism which is arguably</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.480" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">derivative of sovereignty which is you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.550" end="00:21:57.680" style="s2">know quintessential email in its origin</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.470" end="00:21:59.210" style="s2">so we have individualism comes come</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.680" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">there&#39;s individualism is male and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">personhood or personalism if you will</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s female there are two sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:09.290" style="s2">same thing and personal it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:10.790" style="s2">really is much more aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.290" end="00:22:13.010" style="s2">interpersonal dimension of becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.790" end="00:22:14.780" style="s2">person well that&#39;s that&#39;s great because</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.010" end="00:22:16.040" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;ve always you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.780" end="00:22:18.290" style="s2">Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.040" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">on individual sovereignty all the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.290" end="00:22:20.600" style="s2">he&#39;s saying individual sovereignty an</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:23.090" style="s2">you almost can&#39;t get past that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.600" end="00:22:24.440" style="s2">conversation with him and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.090" end="00:22:27.380" style="s2">you want to say groups but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.440" end="00:22:29.330" style="s2">want him you don&#39;t want groups groups he</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.380" end="00:22:31.040" style="s2">always views in the negative and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.330" end="00:22:33.470" style="s2">negative and a negative light even</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.040" end="00:22:36.230" style="s2">though he himself is dependent on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.470" end="00:22:38.450" style="s2">uncertain you know on his group right</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:40.280" style="s2">he&#39;s you know he he he made his name</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.450" end="00:22:42.050" style="s2">based on you know going to certain guys</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.280" end="00:22:45.230" style="s2">and creating this kind of group and as</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.050" end="00:22:47.450" style="s2">the group sustains him but he&#39;s so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.230" end="00:22:49.190" style="s2">you could say there&#39;s a there&#39;s a co</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.450" end="00:22:50.840" style="s2">dependence between the group and the in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.190" end="00:22:52.250" style="s2">and the individual all right so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.840" end="00:22:55.010" style="s2">individual can&#39;t be the individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.250" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">without his small group right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.010" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">fragmented he&#39;s yeah that what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:03.410" style="s2">is he&#39;s isolated he&#39;s in his he&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:06.380" style="s2">without his group right without our</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.410" end="00:23:09.680" style="s2">group no I agree completely and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.380" end="00:23:11.420" style="s2">inclined to think that the more you</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.680" end="00:23:15.850" style="s2">could lower you go in and out in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.420" end="00:23:18.800" style="s2">hierarchy the more you it&#39;s the more its</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.850" end="00:23:20.870" style="s2">its benefit it&#39;s useful to think in</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.800" end="00:23:23.210" style="s2">terms of persons but the higher you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.870" end="00:23:25.190" style="s2">into a hierarchy the more it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.210" end="00:23:27.890" style="s2">it&#39;s more articulate to think in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.190" end="00:23:30.650" style="s2">of individual so at the highest level</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.890" end="00:23:31.640" style="s2">you have these people you know the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.650" end="00:23:33.740" style="s2">of all they&#39;re not they&#39;re on this</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.640" end="00:23:37.010" style="s2">somebody got the together and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.740" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">they know they&#39;re not sinners explain</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.010" end="00:23:40.370" style="s2">now I&#39;m not that clear about that why</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:42.530" style="s2">are the people in the lower hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.370" end="00:23:44.810" style="s2">persons and the people higher on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.530" end="00:23:46.250" style="s2">hierarchy individuals well let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.810" end="00:23:48.560" style="s2">for example children children don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.250" end="00:23:50.540" style="s2">become persons they don&#39;t become you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.560" end="00:23:52.250" style="s2">know a whole human beings as adults</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.540" end="00:23:53.720" style="s2">unless they&#39;re supported by all these</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.250" end="00:23:55.580" style="s2">people these groups the people around</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.720" end="00:23:57.350" style="s2">them and so it&#39;s an interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.580" end="00:24:00.170" style="s2">process of becoming a person and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.350" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">what I&#39;m coming an ego and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.170" end="00:24:03.680" style="s2">Newman&#39;s terms as society develops and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:06.830" style="s2">the ego kind of develops right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.680" end="00:24:09.140" style="s2">develop an ego right huh he says the ego</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.830" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">develops you know we can only have</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.140" end="00:24:12.740" style="s2">rationality you know and science and all</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">these things when the ego has has</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.740" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">developed when the person can become</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:20.060" style="s2">reflective enough to you know to</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">otherwise otherwise otherwise we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.060" end="00:24:25.460" style="s2">part of a you know we&#39;re just part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:28.700" style="s2">this collectivity the collective mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.460" end="00:24:29.910" style="s2">right my feeling is that that exists in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.700" end="00:24:32.130" style="s2">degrees and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.910" end="00:24:33.540" style="s2">so the ego is a variation on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.130" end="00:24:36.930" style="s2">individual there&#39;s also variation on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.540" end="00:24:38.670" style="s2">person and so since there are many</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.930" end="00:24:40.590" style="s2">levels if you think of small groups and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.670" end="00:24:43.020" style="s2">you think of MIT like like I just talked</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.590" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">about my electorate my democracy</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.020" end="00:24:47.430" style="s2">Democratic hierarchy there&#39;s many many</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:50.060" style="s2">Latin many many levels and with each</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.430" end="00:24:53.280" style="s2">level you&#39;re you&#39;re you are</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.060" end="00:24:56.310" style="s2">individuating more and move and so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.280" end="00:24:58.050" style="s2">have this and and it&#39;s also I think in</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.310" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">terms of human development it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.050" end="00:25:02.730" style="s2">difficult to move from one level to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:04.380" style="s2">next which is why we often there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.730" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">of fear and suffering and stuff on when</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.380" end="00:25:09.300" style="s2">we&#39;re when we&#39;re transferring to another</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:11.580" style="s2">level here&#39;s an idea and and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.300" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">reason is there they they have different</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.580" end="00:25:15.960" style="s2">languages say there they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:17.160" style="s2">different cultures they so at the very</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.960" end="00:25:19.410" style="s2">highest level I was just thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.160" end="00:25:20.940" style="s2">it we treated the injured God oh you</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.410" end="00:25:22.530" style="s2">don&#39;t know much about the integral model</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.940" end="00:25:25.680" style="s2">but the integral model is that you move</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.530" end="00:25:27.690" style="s2">from orange to blue to green you you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.680" end="00:25:29.730" style="s2">are it&#39;s blue to orange to green it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.690" end="00:25:32.190" style="s2">you move from a let&#39;s say a national</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.730" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">society where it&#39;s really the tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.190" end="00:25:37.380" style="s2">the clan and the nation into an</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:40.260" style="s2">international society where it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.380" end="00:25:42.570" style="s2">about business you know into individuals</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.260" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">and then you move to a green society</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.570" end="00:25:47.100" style="s2">where it&#39;s all about you know it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:50.010" style="s2">about you know more larger you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.100" end="00:25:52.200" style="s2">all about you know it&#39;s you more</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.010" end="00:25:53.910" style="s2">universal and in its ideas you keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.200" end="00:25:55.920" style="s2">moving up and then you get to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.910" end="00:25:57.240" style="s2">level it&#39;s called second tier together</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.920" end="00:25:59.970" style="s2">above second tier you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.240" end="00:26:01.800" style="s2">integrate the the previous levels rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.970" end="00:26:03.900" style="s2">than just judging the world from</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.800" end="00:26:06.540" style="s2">whatever level you&#39;re at in deciding the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.900" end="00:26:08.070" style="s2">people at the lower levels are back yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.540" end="00:26:11.610" style="s2">so anyway I just it sounds like what</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.070" end="00:26:13.830" style="s2">you&#39;re describing is similar to to to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.610" end="00:26:16.740" style="s2">this integral idea where the previous</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.830" end="00:26:19.530" style="s2">there&#39;s like previous level integrates</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.740" end="00:26:21.900" style="s2">the previous level and then after you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.530" end="00:26:25.080" style="s2">get a certain point you&#39;re able to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.900" end="00:26:28.280" style="s2">you&#39;re able to integrate all the pre the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.080" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">the lower levels and understand them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.280" end="00:26:33.720" style="s2">I guess maybe that&#39;s when you become</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:34.970" style="s2">more an individual in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.720" end="00:26:40.830" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.970" end="00:26:43.530" style="s2">well this Democratic model is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.830" end="00:26:47.040" style="s2">reflection of what really is anyway</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.530" end="00:26:49.860" style="s2">and then it said then with each level</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.040" end="00:26:52.620" style="s2">numbers are reduced exponentially if</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.860" end="00:26:55.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship with negative</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.620" end="00:26:57.390" style="s2">exponential as you go up in other words</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.220" end="00:26:59.340" style="s2">you know well you can think of it the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.390" end="00:27:01.950" style="s2">opposite way level one day to represent</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.340" end="00:27:04.110" style="s2">ten people level two later represents</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.950" end="00:27:06.120" style="s2">100 a level three average of encryption</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.110" end="00:27:08.280" style="s2">mm well if you think of it in reverse</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.120" end="00:27:09.900" style="s2">and the numbers are going down that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.280" end="00:27:12.840" style="s2">the same rate at the same exponential</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.900" end="00:27:14.190" style="s2">rate and so whether you know you think</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.840" end="00:27:15.990" style="s2">about these different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.190" end="00:27:19.620" style="s2">integrating than the people at the top</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.990" end="00:27:22.650" style="s2">are very small numbers and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.620" end="00:27:24.690" style="s2">people at the next level down are a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.650" end="00:27:28.140" style="s2">certain exponential power you know is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.690" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">there whatever you know it keeps going</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.140" end="00:27:32.910" style="s2">up the number of people that is every</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:35.340" style="s2">given level keeps going up by just how</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.910" end="00:27:37.740" style="s2">do you avoid that becoming a stratified</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.340" end="00:27:41.430" style="s2">kind of medieval kind of kind of society</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.740" end="00:27:42.750" style="s2">poverty what democracy we voted the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.430" end="00:27:44.940" style="s2">voting business the board would the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.750" end="00:27:47.750" style="s2">people the fact you have a decision in</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.940" end="00:27:49.770" style="s2">and who&#39;s the leader and stuff and okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.750" end="00:27:52.250" style="s2">election you&#39;re sending up new people</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.770" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">that are election right but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.250" end="00:27:58.290" style="s2">there&#39;s movement through the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:28:01.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not stuck static stable</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.290" end="00:28:04.170" style="s2">fixed fixed world there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.010" end="00:28:05.910" style="s2">circulation yeah and my guess the change</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.170" end="00:28:08.370" style="s2">is just a guess that the change of power</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.910" end="00:28:10.050" style="s2">would be more radical to change if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.370" end="00:28:12.210" style="s2">know decision decision making the</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.710" end="00:28:21.870" style="s2">have it would be more dynamic so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.020" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">know my money imagining person so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.870" end="00:28:26.790" style="s2">did you it would fix you know what</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:29.790" style="s2">happens is societies entrench themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.790" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">in one way of being for too long and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.790" end="00:28:33.690" style="s2">then it&#39;s like turning around this</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:35.220" style="s2">massive shift and it&#39;s just it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.690" end="00:28:37.710" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a huge huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.220" end="00:28:40.790" style="s2">suffering but if we&#39;re turning the ship</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.710" end="00:28:43.740" style="s2">a little bit all the time then then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.790" end="00:28:45.540" style="s2">you know there&#39;s way less pain and way</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.740" end="00:28:47.940" style="s2">more benefits it seems to me and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.540" end="00:28:50.190" style="s2">address you know we&#39;re less much less</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.940" end="00:28:53.370" style="s2">able to ignore problems so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.190" end="00:28:55.650" style="s2">these this more dynamic electro system</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.370" end="00:28:57.370" style="s2">which sends up people who are better</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.650" end="00:29:02.260" style="s2">able to dress</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.370" end="00:29:04.600" style="s2">the problems that we have and then then</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.260" end="00:29:05.920" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s just it was just an</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.600" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">idea about small groups which have which</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.920" end="00:29:11.790" style="s2">kind of accept which I thought with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:14.110" style="s2">solution to the collective problem of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.790" end="00:29:16.570" style="s2">first of all identity politics but also</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.110" end="00:29:18.550" style="s2">the idea that people people are this</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.570" end="00:29:20.890" style="s2">almost everybody&#39;s at the bottom of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.550" end="00:29:23.230" style="s2">you know where if you&#39;re a song writer</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.890" end="00:29:24.910" style="s2">I&#39;m you know songwriters never sell a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.230" end="00:29:28.060" style="s2">song you know they never they never make</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.910" end="00:29:31.510" style="s2">a cent with their song and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.060" end="00:29:34.750" style="s2">normal it&#39;s not and so how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.510" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">we how do we make it so that that those</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.750" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">hierarchies actually make make sense how</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:41.680" style="s2">do how do they actually provide people</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.500" end="00:29:44.770" style="s2">and also maximize people people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.680" end="00:29:46.600" style="s2">potential at the bottom right at the top</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.770" end="00:29:48.490" style="s2">there they got there because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.600" end="00:29:50.410" style="s2">they&#39;re better at measuring the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.490" end="00:29:53.320" style="s2">potential probably there&#39;s too much dead</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.410" end="00:29:55.060" style="s2">dead weight up here you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.320" end="00:29:56.590" style="s2">just up there for no reason they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.060" end="00:29:58.990" style="s2">you know and then there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.590" end="00:30:01.330" style="s2">probably too much potential down here</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.990" end="00:30:04.330" style="s2">you know there seems to be the problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.330" end="00:30:07.060" style="s2">is is that you know a guy like you who</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.330" end="00:30:09.370" style="s2">writes these sublime songs you know you</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.060" end="00:30:13.060" style="s2">know who&#39;s gonna who&#39;s gonna take you on</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.370" end="00:30:15.580" style="s2">and then how to get your songs to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.060" end="00:30:17.260" style="s2">know it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it does there</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.580" end="00:30:20.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be structures in place</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.260" end="00:30:22.950" style="s2">that there are structures but there</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.740" end="00:30:27.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be structures that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.950" end="00:30:29.050" style="s2">valorize quality or talent or or well I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.490" end="00:30:30.610" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think Peterson says this</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.050" end="00:30:33.730" style="s2">really clearly but he kind of says it he</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.610" end="00:30:35.410" style="s2">says basically you know harpies are</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.730" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">inherently conservative and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.410" end="00:30:39.610" style="s2">conscientiousness is rewarded is reward</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:43.270" style="s2">at the higher levels of hierarchy but</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.610" end="00:30:44.830" style="s2">but you know the left winger is fine</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.270" end="00:30:46.540" style="s2">openness and loan conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.830" end="00:30:49.750" style="s2">which is not particularly conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.540" end="00:30:51.550" style="s2">riding a bike or Keke&#39;s yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.750" end="00:30:52.990" style="s2">actually a fair bit of intelligence down</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.550" end="00:30:55.090" style="s2">at the bottom of hierarchies people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.990" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">not rising up not succeeding between you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.090" end="00:31:01.210" style="s2">know in quotes I think it&#39;s because of</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:02.800" style="s2">their temperaments and and so in other</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.210" end="00:31:05.100" style="s2">words well it&#39;s because they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.800" end="00:31:08.770" style="s2">two things at one time they can be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.100" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">effective you know promoter manager and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.770" end="00:31:13.320" style="s2">the artist at the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:15.660" style="s2">so yeah you do need the group you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.320" end="00:31:18.690" style="s2">yeah it comes back to our discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.660" end="00:31:22.169" style="s2">groups so you do not you do need the guy</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.690" end="00:31:23.370" style="s2">that&#39;s going to you know whose goods</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.169" end="00:31:25.220" style="s2">gonna do that it was high in</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.370" end="00:31:27.660" style="s2">conscientiousness you know to help</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.220" end="00:31:29.789" style="s2">clowns like me and you who are low in</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.660" end="00:31:32.760" style="s2">conscientiousness if I open this you</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.789" end="00:31:36.630" style="s2">know to to actually find you know to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.760" end="00:31:40.580" style="s2">take that and bring it into a embodied</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.630" end="00:31:43.409" style="s2">form in the world or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.580" end="00:31:46.919" style="s2">so the small group brings together these</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.409" end="00:31:48.659" style="s2">they&#39;re different yeah I never thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.919" end="00:31:51.179" style="s2">of that but that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.659" end="00:31:53.520" style="s2">no no that&#39;s absolutely true I was going</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.179" end="00:31:55.740" style="s2">to take something else yeah the wall I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.520" end="00:31:58.049" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s that five the five traits</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.740" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">thing just that that&#39;s kind of blog blog</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.049" end="00:32:05.130" style="s2">blown mine that kind of well in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:06.809" style="s2">because again it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.130" end="00:32:08.370" style="s2">it&#39;s ten it&#39;s again it&#39;s that number</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.809" end="00:32:10.110" style="s2">again you said ten and ten there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.370" end="00:32:11.909" style="s2">actually two parts of every trade you</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.110" end="00:32:14.580" style="s2">know there&#39;s an openness there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.909" end="00:32:17.520" style="s2">there&#39;s the more mathematical type of</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.580" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">openness and the more you know lateral</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.520" end="00:32:22.350" style="s2">thinking type of openness and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.970" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s about ten different</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.350" end="00:32:28.110" style="s2">traits and maybe running around you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:30.179" style="s2">qualities or styles of person you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.110" end="00:32:31.950" style="s2">and if you have the right balance of all</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.179" end="00:32:33.450" style="s2">those then you have like what you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.950" end="00:32:35.549" style="s2">you would call in Buddhism a mandala</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.450" end="00:32:37.530" style="s2">would be with like a complete a complete</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.549" end="00:32:39.750" style="s2">world right if you have all these people</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.530" end="00:32:42.059" style="s2">are in in different places sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.750" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">working working their asses off but not</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.059" end="00:32:46.470" style="s2">really succeeding because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:52.669" style="s2">have the right people around them or</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.470" end="00:32:54.809" style="s2">support right yeah absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.669" end="00:32:56.970" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much all I have a stable</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.809" end="00:32:58.770" style="s2">Sangha so I&#39;d be tempted to like I have</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.970" end="00:33:04.169" style="s2">this this what I consider to be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.770" end="00:33:07.289" style="s2">threefold theory about getting us out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.169" end="00:33:10.260" style="s2">our fix because one is one of one one</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.289" end="00:33:12.780" style="s2">big thing we have is environmental and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.260" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">the other is democratic reform and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.780" end="00:33:17.700" style="s2">third I think is is this huge sphere</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:19.530" style="s2">which may not happen but the huge fear</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.700" end="00:33:21.630" style="s2">of mass redundancy which is encroaching</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.530" end="00:33:23.820" style="s2">upon us in other words oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.630" end="00:33:24.210" style="s2">reason numbers are going to be put out</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.820" end="00:33:26.429" style="s2">of war</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.210" end="00:33:29.879" style="s2">because of robotic ization and what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.429" end="00:33:32.730" style="s2">want us and and so this I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.879" end="00:33:35.070" style="s2">thinking that this is a this is three</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.730" end="00:33:36.980" style="s2">sides of the exact same problem so what</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.070" end="00:33:41.730" style="s2">I just articulated was economic</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.980" end="00:33:44.669" style="s2">democratic reform and and and how a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.730" end="00:33:46.649" style="s2">small groups is a way out of that but</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.669" end="00:33:48.749" style="s2">another idea and maybe maybe I should</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.649" end="00:33:52.350" style="s2">get into it now because it&#39;s a longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.749" end="00:33:55.409" style="s2">journey but no it&#39;s about it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.350" end="00:33:59.399" style="s2">what I call the reusable economy like in</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.409" end="00:34:02.759" style="s2">environmental law environmental ethics</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.399" end="00:34:05.100" style="s2">there&#39;s the the three-step process of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.759" end="00:34:06.360" style="s2">reduce reuse and recycle you pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.100" end="00:34:09.419" style="s2">I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard that Regents use a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.360" end="00:34:14.460" style="s2">sec so we do reducing your consumption</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.419" end="00:34:18.300" style="s2">of packaging and a stall is bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.460" end="00:34:20.609" style="s2">and reusing is is the next best thing so</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.300" end="00:34:22.770" style="s2">if you have a plastic bag first of all</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.609" end="00:34:25.020" style="s2">the best thing to do is to not consume</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.770" end="00:34:27.300" style="s2">plastic bag and then the second best</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.020" end="00:34:29.879" style="s2">thing to do is to reuse your plastic bag</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.300" end="00:34:32.190" style="s2">if you are consuming them and the third</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.879" end="00:34:35.849" style="s2">best thing if you if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.190" end="00:34:37.829" style="s2">not really if you&#39;re not reducing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.849" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not reusing is to recycle in</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.829" end="00:34:44.309" style="s2">other words to put them into into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:46.409" style="s2">city recycling where they will be turned</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.309" end="00:34:49.230" style="s2">into something else you know so this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.409" end="00:34:51.750" style="s2">a standard established ethic for</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.230" end="00:34:54.149" style="s2">environmental and I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.750" end="00:34:56.250" style="s2">about this and I realize wow if I</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.149" end="00:34:58.559" style="s2">realize but I&#39;m Olivia right can I stop</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.250" end="00:35:01.710" style="s2">you just for a second there see there</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.559" end="00:35:04.170" style="s2">seems to be two modes of thought right</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.710" end="00:35:06.210" style="s2">one is extremely pessimistic right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.170" end="00:35:08.220" style="s2">we&#39;re on the Titanic drinking our</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.210" end="00:35:10.859" style="s2">champagne and we&#39;re gonna go to hell on</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.220" end="00:35:12.540" style="s2">it very soon and then the other motive</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.859" end="00:35:14.369" style="s2">father&#39;s like the Steven Pinker motive</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:15.780" style="s2">far is where we&#39;re getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.369" end="00:35:18.780" style="s2">better every day and there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.780" end="00:35:20.490" style="s2">poverty and and all not except the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.780" end="00:35:23.099" style="s2">problem with that view is not the long</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.490" end="00:35:25.140" style="s2">view it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like because in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.099" end="00:35:27.329" style="s2">long view it looks kind of caught at</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:30.450" style="s2">catastrophic but in the short view it</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.329" end="00:35:33.750" style="s2">seems it seems to be everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.450" end="00:35:36.770" style="s2">getting better so so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.750" end="00:35:40.100" style="s2">throw that in like so so so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.770" end="00:35:43.450" style="s2">so so you&#39;re kind of that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.100" end="00:35:43.450" style="s2">where you&#39;re going and in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.480" end="00:35:49.010" style="s2">to be optimistic the idea I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.480" end="00:35:50.810" style="s2">great technological revolution was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.010" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">made us made us rich and is making the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.810" end="00:35:56.390" style="s2">whole world we really fast is arguably</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:58.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just a mark me it may be just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.390" end="00:35:59.840" style="s2">learning process might take fifty years</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.040" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">maybe a baby a big hundred years and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.840" end="00:36:04.580" style="s2">then we&#39;ll figure it out how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:07.910" style="s2">how to live alongside nature and allow</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.580" end="00:36:10.820" style="s2">nature to thrive how to not you know to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.910" end="00:36:12.350" style="s2">not be rendering species extinct you</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.820" end="00:36:13.910" style="s2">know at the Grady rate that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.350" end="00:36:16.610" style="s2">and we could probably figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.910" end="00:36:17.810" style="s2">over time and it&#39;s all brand-new in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.610" end="00:36:19.640" style="s2">other words we&#39;re Brett we&#39;re new to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.810" end="00:36:21.530" style="s2">this and so we haven&#39;t got clue without</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.640" end="00:36:22.070" style="s2">reading what we&#39;re learning very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.530" end="00:36:23.390" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.070" end="00:36:25.220" style="s2">so those realtors are very optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.390" end="00:36:26.780" style="s2">argue that this is just going to work</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.220" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2">itself out in time just because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.780" end="00:36:33.560" style="s2">busy working it out and and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:35.480" style="s2">lots of lots of reason for optimism I</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.560" end="00:36:37.820" style="s2">think now that doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.480" end="00:36:39.890" style="s2">to happen it could be a disaster but</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.820" end="00:36:42.550" style="s2">what I was this this idea in mind about</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.890" end="00:36:44.420" style="s2">environment and I don&#39;t know much about</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.550" end="00:36:45.890" style="s2">but I&#39;ve been thinking about mass</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.420" end="00:36:50.440" style="s2">redundancy here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.890" end="00:36:53.620" style="s2">the imagine you&#39;re in a neighborhood and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.440" end="00:36:57.650" style="s2">in some time in the near future and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.620" end="00:37:00.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a the new law not only much more</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.650" end="00:37:02.030" style="s2">than a law a new ethic is deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.230" end="00:37:05.750" style="s2">place in your neighborhood and this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.030" end="00:37:07.570" style="s2">the ethics no garbage is allowed ever to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.750" end="00:37:09.530" style="s2">leave your neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.570" end="00:37:13.630" style="s2">imagine all the garbage that gets put</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.530" end="00:37:16.460" style="s2">out once a week gets picked up no not a</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.630" end="00:37:17.900" style="s2">good sewage by the way everything gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.460" end="00:37:19.610" style="s2">flushed down the toilet is not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.900" end="00:37:21.830" style="s2">to neat leave your neighborhood nothing</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.610" end="00:37:24.790" style="s2">is allowed to leave so what what happens</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.830" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">in so what happens then is people</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.790" end="00:37:31.220" style="s2">organized in a very serious kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:34.100" style="s2">so you know glass and plastic and rubber</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.220" end="00:37:35.660" style="s2">tires and car wrecks all these like</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.100" end="00:37:36.920" style="s2">things have to be organizing they have</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.660" end="00:37:39.350" style="s2">to be looked at they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.920" end="00:37:42.380" style="s2">repurposed one form another and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.350" end="00:37:45.650" style="s2">willing to I&#39;m interested in the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.380" end="00:37:47.330" style="s2">that this in and of itself may be the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.650" end="00:37:49.340" style="s2">solution to our problem of mass</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.330" end="00:37:50.660" style="s2">redundancy because we produce so much</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.340" end="00:37:52.250" style="s2"> we</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.660" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s in crates how much garbage is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.250" end="00:37:59.240" style="s2">work just the work of recycling our our</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:04.970" style="s2">stuff yeah well we&#39;re forced to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.240" end="00:38:06.650" style="s2">repurpose it it&#39;s very easy for me to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.970" end="00:38:08.900" style="s2">imagine all this garbage being used to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.650" end="00:38:10.430" style="s2">build houses it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.900" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">a difficult thing to imagine well now</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.430" end="00:38:15.230" style="s2">that you can your car engines can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">used to run all kinds of mills so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.230" end="00:38:21.950" style="s2">can do all kind I&#39;m a man taking my hair</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.240" style="s2">Brazil and in some way like how are we</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:44.570" style="s2">going to do that with our with our you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.240" end="00:38:49.010" style="s2">know with our types of lifestyles that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.570" end="00:38:51.170" style="s2">we have I mean one way and one way to do</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.450" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">people know that it&#39;s gradually over a</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.190" end="00:39:20.660" style="s2">have to spend the next 30 years learning</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.150" end="00:39:27.770" style="s2">convinced that&#39;s kind of different than</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.890" end="00:39:32.450" style="s2">a bit different than the what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.770" end="00:39:33.860" style="s2">the guaranteed income with people I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.450" end="00:39:35.390" style="s2">thinking a lot about guaranteed income</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.860" end="00:39:40.940" style="s2">and I was attracted to it for a while</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.390" end="00:39:42.740" style="s2">and then I began to think of it as the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.940" end="00:39:46.700" style="s2">hell on earth you know we&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.740" end="00:39:48.260" style="s2">to become you know we&#39;re going to become</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.700" end="00:39:53.870" style="s2">something very undesirable</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.260" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">I already we may and I you know have</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.870" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">become something quite undone desirable</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:40:02.840" style="s2">haven&#39;t we in some sense like do</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:06.810" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard of the black conservative</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.840" end="00:40:08.910" style="s2">thinker Thomas soul right yeah I have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.810" end="00:40:11.430" style="s2">little bit talked about this syllabus</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.910" end="00:40:13.710" style="s2">that the introduction of social welter</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.430" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">in the 1960s was very a very negative</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.710" end="00:40:19.830" style="s2">impact on black America they were</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:23.970" style="s2">basically progressing generally in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.830" end="00:40:26.730" style="s2">fairly organic way through to in in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.970" end="00:40:29.700" style="s2">first half of the 20th century and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.730" end="00:40:31.830" style="s2">and the introduction was what was known</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.700" end="00:40:36.180" style="s2">as the war on poverty basically set them</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.830" end="00:40:37.800" style="s2">back it is okay and turned them into it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.180" end="00:40:40.020" style="s2">turned the black black American identity</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.800" end="00:40:42.600" style="s2">into something you know like welfare</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.020" end="00:40:44.940" style="s2">recipients which they were not and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.600" end="00:40:48.270" style="s2">and it was was unintentional</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.940" end="00:40:50.100" style="s2">and and it basically it costed them in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.270" end="00:40:52.370" style="s2">certain pocket of society where they</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.100" end="00:40:54.840" style="s2">were they had not been before</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.370" end="00:40:57.570" style="s2">that&#39;s only that&#39;s only one thought here</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.840" end="00:41:00.120" style="s2">I mean it just seems to me that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.570" end="00:41:01.530" style="s2">not even like when your best intentions</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.120" end="00:41:03.300" style="s2">create a hell on earth or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.530" end="00:41:05.970" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re trying to make everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.300" end="00:41:11.070" style="s2">happy create a you take away their like</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.970" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">a sense of responsibility or you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.070" end="00:41:14.310" style="s2">Thomas all has a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:15.960" style="s2">argument he basically said that in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.310" end="00:41:19.160" style="s2">late 19th century there were very very</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.960" end="00:41:21.390" style="s2">deliberate policies put in place very</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.160" end="00:41:25.320" style="s2">deliberately racist policies put in</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.390" end="00:41:28.200" style="s2">place too in the American salad too to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.320" end="00:41:30.660" style="s2">keep black people down and it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.200" end="00:41:33.390" style="s2">delivered and it was it was there was no</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.660" end="00:41:35.780" style="s2">there was no hiding it it was explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.390" end="00:41:39.690" style="s2">racist and it didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.780" end="00:41:41.400" style="s2">he showed that the black American black</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.690" end="00:41:43.530" style="s2">American people they actually did fairly</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.400" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">well they they got they prospered during</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.530" end="00:41:46.140" style="s2">that period they did pretty well and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.270" style="s2">they progressively did well right</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.140" end="00:41:50.730" style="s2">through the twentieth century on Hill in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.270" end="00:41:52.550" style="s2">his view until the war on poverty and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.730" end="00:41:54.630" style="s2">in other words there was a deliberative</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.550" end="00:41:57.870" style="s2">polishing he put in place to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.630" end="00:41:59.460" style="s2">Liam please black people now it had in</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.870" end="00:42:01.710" style="s2">his opinion possibly the reverse effect</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.460" end="00:42:04.890" style="s2">and then in the 1960s there was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.710" end="00:42:08.520" style="s2">deliberately a deliberate effort to to</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.890" end="00:42:10.290" style="s2">mitigate racism and to to to improve the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.520" end="00:42:12.570" style="s2">lives of those considered to be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.290" end="00:42:14.690" style="s2">portion also had a negative effect and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.570" end="00:42:16.610" style="s2">the reverse effect in his</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.690" end="00:42:19.600" style="s2">so he&#39;s basically saying social policy</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.610" end="00:42:22.010" style="s2">does not have what what we intended to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.600" end="00:42:23.990" style="s2">be so be aware so which is why you</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.010" end="00:42:27.470" style="s2">became a conservative I think into it</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.990" end="00:42:28.760" style="s2">was kind of wise you can well this may</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.470" end="00:42:30.110" style="s2">be something that&#39;s I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.760" end="00:42:37.340" style="s2">about is I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.110" end="00:42:39.800" style="s2">conservatism right and it seems that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.340" end="00:42:41.090" style="s2">most intelligent view is that on one</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.800" end="00:42:42.950" style="s2">hand very progressive and very</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.090" end="00:42:45.020" style="s2">conservative at the same time I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.950" end="00:42:46.910" style="s2">thinking I was thinking of musicians who</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.020" end="00:42:48.830" style="s2">are good right and they always have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.910" end="00:42:51.380" style="s2">attachment to tradition in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.830" end="00:42:53.000" style="s2">way but also they&#39;re also way in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.380" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">future in some kind of way you know like</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.000" end="00:42:57.290" style="s2">William Blake or even Bob Dylan is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:59.120" style="s2">very he&#39;s a traditionalist like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.290" end="00:43:02.030" style="s2">always and he does the most radical</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.120" end="00:43:04.460" style="s2">thing so the most radical thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.030" end="00:43:07.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like this I don&#39;t know a double</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.460" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">arrow thing of looking forward and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.130" end="00:43:11.480" style="s2">looking back at the same time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:13.580" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re very aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.480" end="00:43:15.260" style="s2">tradition but at the same time you you</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.580" end="00:43:18.110" style="s2">you know you can see beyond it or</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.260" end="00:43:20.390" style="s2">something like that I totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.110" end="00:43:23.360" style="s2">completely agree so I was always very</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.390" end="00:43:29.170" style="s2">negative about conservatism somehow and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.360" end="00:43:32.150" style="s2">somehow I I&#39;m understanding it more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.170" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">the rate because progressives tend to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.150" end="00:43:35.840" style="s2">run away with everything and and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:38.120" style="s2">again they end up making everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.840" end="00:43:39.620" style="s2">worse through it through that they end</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.120" end="00:43:43.640" style="s2">up gritting making a hell of their best</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.620" end="00:43:45.230" style="s2">intentions well the very basic principle</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.640" end="00:43:47.120" style="s2">of conservatism I think was articulated</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.230" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">by a Sir Edmund Burke I&#39;ve never read</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.120" end="00:43:53.150" style="s2">and butter for HP he&#39;s been explained to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:54.650" style="s2">me which was that basically this be</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.150" end="00:43:57.500" style="s2">careful when you go about changing</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.650" end="00:44:00.610" style="s2">things because you may see all these</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.500" end="00:44:02.780" style="s2">problems but that doesn&#39;t mean you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.610" end="00:44:05.660" style="s2">you may you see how things are not</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.780" end="00:44:07.550" style="s2">working maybe things are not working</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.660" end="00:44:09.170" style="s2">but but it but it may not be one big</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.550" end="00:44:11.090" style="s2">tear to you how things are actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.170" end="00:44:12.860" style="s2">working so there&#39;s there might be all</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.090" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">these dimensions that you don&#39;t see and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.860" end="00:44:18.050" style="s2">things work and when things are working</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.650" end="00:44:20.360" style="s2">well you don&#39;t recognize it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.050" end="00:44:21.560" style="s2">working it&#39;s really only when you when</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.360" end="00:44:23.600" style="s2">you you know you don&#39;t you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.560" end="00:44:24.830" style="s2">about your knee into your knee into your</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.600" end="00:44:26.950" style="s2">knee starts to hurt you you know you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.830" end="00:44:29.130" style="s2">start thinking arthritis in your knees</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.950" end="00:44:31.980" style="s2">then you think about it all the time so</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.130" end="00:44:34.839" style="s2">and so all these things that are working</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.980" end="00:44:39.130" style="s2">that so if you&#39;re going to go about</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.839" end="00:44:42.910" style="s2">changing society then you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.130" end="00:44:44.170" style="s2">better damn well be open to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.910" end="00:44:46.180" style="s2">that you might make it out of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.170" end="00:44:47.740" style="s2">worse and that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s facing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.180" end="00:44:49.930" style="s2">the basic principle looking services</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.740" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">don&#39;t change what works but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.930" end="00:44:55.000" style="s2">is quite often we don&#39;t know what works</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:57.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t know yeah well yeah that just</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.000" end="00:45:00.040" style="s2">keeps us stuck in some kind of mode</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.400" end="00:45:02.010" style="s2">whereas you know we also always have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.040" end="00:45:04.150" style="s2">jump out into the unknown and an</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.010" end="00:45:06.510" style="s2">experiment or learn I guess it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.150" end="00:45:08.829" style="s2">where you where you put the parameters</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.510" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking that the word I hate</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.829" end="00:45:13.510" style="s2">the word progressive it&#39;s a it&#39;s a self</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.440" end="00:45:16.980" style="s2">flattering word to be a progressive I</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.510" end="00:45:20.290" style="s2">think the real the real word for</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.980" end="00:45:21.550" style="s2">left-wing people is experimental so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.290" end="00:45:25.089" style="s2">opposite of conservatism is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.550" end="00:45:26.950" style="s2">experimentalist I think we would be it</p>

<p begin="00:46:36.550" end="00:46:40.760" style="s2">reusable thing it seems to me that all</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:50.510" style="s2">sliding the tin cans other stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.770" end="00:46:54.830" style="s2">know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gone throughout this</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.510" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">great effort to take it out of the</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.100" end="00:47:03.470" style="s2">transformed it into all these product</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.140" end="00:47:05.330" style="s2">products and and then and then we just</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.470" end="00:47:06.320" style="s2">throw it away or we give it to charity</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.330" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">or something you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.320" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">apparently 75% of clothing that goes</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.740" style="s2">that goes to a charitable clothing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:15.020" style="s2">source they don&#39;t get they don&#39;t get</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.020" end="00:47:18.950" style="s2">get sold so in other words it makes way</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.360" end="00:47:20.690" style="s2">more sense that takes a big pot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.950" end="00:47:22.940" style="s2">clothing that gets produced in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.690" end="00:47:26.180" style="s2">neighborhood on a fairly regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.940" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">and to repurpose it they can be</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.180" end="00:47:30.260" style="s2">repurposed in all kinds away so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:33.440" style="s2">my point is you have this many step</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.260" end="00:47:35.840" style="s2">process before a product ends up on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.440" end="00:47:38.060" style="s2">shelves and we buy it but all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.840" end="00:47:41.600" style="s2">doing when you&#39;re repurposing it from a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.060" end="00:47:44.840" style="s2">product is going back one step so this</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.600" end="00:47:46.370" style="s2">great effort this great process of</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.840" end="00:47:48.500" style="s2">taking it out of the ground or</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.370" end="00:47:50.090" style="s2">harvesting it or whatever and putting it</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.500" end="00:47:52.130" style="s2">in a factory work where it gets</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.090" end="00:47:54.830" style="s2">transformed in some within the packaging</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.130" end="00:47:58.100" style="s2">all of this difficult capital capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.830" end="00:48:01.570" style="s2">process is done for us and all we do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.100" end="00:48:04.610" style="s2">go back one step and in a sense we</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.570" end="00:48:06.980" style="s2">remanufacture what what all this this</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.610" end="00:48:09.410" style="s2">waste that we have so when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.980" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">innocent in a way that&#39;s in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.410" end="00:48:16.610" style="s2">they&#39;re in the way that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:19.480" style="s2">beginning to happen isn&#39;t it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.610" end="00:48:23.570" style="s2">think very small and rather you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.480" end="00:48:25.310" style="s2">token ways but I don&#39;t think we science</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.570" end="00:48:28.430" style="s2">recycling to me is very expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.310" end="00:48:29.660" style="s2">very energy and it consumes an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.430" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">amount of energy for work for one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.660" end="00:48:33.590" style="s2">those you know cars get crushed down and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:35.930" style="s2">smelled in stuff now maybe that make</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.590" end="00:48:37.940" style="s2">sense but maybe I&#39;m wrong and and all</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.930" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">packaging you know our cereal boxes and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.940" end="00:48:41.810" style="s2">stuff they just get you know they just</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:43.850" style="s2">get the crushed down and recycle is</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.810" end="00:48:45.650" style="s2">amazing things to me that we could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.850" end="00:48:47.840" style="s2">more intelligent with the way we use</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.650" end="00:48:50.930" style="s2">this stuff and not only that it could</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.840" end="00:48:53.060" style="s2">potentially provide a lobby for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.930" end="00:48:54.460" style="s2">bottom base of our site in other words</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.060" end="00:48:56.859" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.460" end="00:49:00.010" style="s2">being returned to something like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.859" end="00:49:02.020" style="s2">economy except you&#39;re using the using</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.010" end="00:49:04.630" style="s2">the leftovers of capitalism in order to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.020" end="00:49:06.820" style="s2">do so now I know that in poor countries</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.630" end="00:49:08.050" style="s2">they do this anyway well you could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.820" end="00:49:10.750" style="s2">more organized the government could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.050" end="00:49:12.369" style="s2">involved so it&#39;s creating a more</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.750" end="00:49:16.180" style="s2">sensible infrastructure so to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.369" end="00:49:21.339" style="s2">this right anyway that&#39;s just an idea so</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.180" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">there was my so yeah we got we got we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.339" end="00:49:31.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve together we&#39;ve managed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:36.040" style="s2">repurpose democracy and and work I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.170" end="00:49:40.300" style="s2">yeah democratic reform figuring out ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.040" end="00:49:42.490" style="s2">to make the bottom of our society more</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.300" end="00:49:43.990" style="s2">viable without looking for handouts</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.490" end="00:49:47.859" style="s2">so in other words this makes perfect</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.990" end="00:49:49.960" style="s2">sense and then also the release of</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.859" end="00:49:55.450" style="s2">negativity of the social welfare society</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.960" end="00:49:58.300" style="s2">all these hand up yeah well again this I</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.450" end="00:50:01.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know I guess we talk probably too</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.300" end="00:50:05.859" style="s2">much about Jordan Peterson but this this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.240" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">this shift from a rights you know this</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.859" end="00:50:11.410" style="s2">is my right to this and this and this</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:13.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t it&#39;s like an adolescent it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.410" end="00:50:15.910" style="s2">an adolescent society right he demands</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.750" end="00:50:19.380" style="s2">rights from everything and won&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.910" end="00:50:21.490" style="s2">back right so so then so then</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.380" end="00:50:23.830" style="s2">discovering that what people at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.490" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">bottom what people who are in hell or in</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.830" end="00:50:31.510" style="s2">bad shape or you know are just in</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:33.640" style="s2">poverty what might bring them back what</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.510" end="00:50:36.130" style="s2">would be you know some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.640" end="00:50:37.510" style="s2">responsibility but then the tricky thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.130" end="00:50:41.670" style="s2">is how do you do that without just</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.510" end="00:50:45.280" style="s2">hurting them into some kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.670" end="00:50:51.880" style="s2">you know more and more and more of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.280" end="00:50:54.460" style="s2">but you know programs fix people or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.880" end="00:50:56.950" style="s2">I mean one of the things that attracts</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.460" end="00:50:59.380" style="s2">me about this reusable economy idea is</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.950" end="00:51:00.790" style="s2">is it&#39;s kind of free people are just</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.380" end="00:51:02.830" style="s2">people left alone you&#39;re not telling</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.790" end="00:51:05.140" style="s2">them what to do you just think you do</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.830" end="00:51:06.580" style="s2">there is a vision a larger structural</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.140" end="00:51:08.349" style="s2">vision but you&#39;re not telling people</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.580" end="00:51:11.559" style="s2">what do you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.349" end="00:51:13.720" style="s2">you&#39;re not if there&#39;s a kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.559" end="00:51:15.519" style="s2">free it&#39;s kind of like the bottom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.720" end="00:51:18.369" style="s2">like a subsistence capitalism they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.519" end="00:51:19.479" style="s2">still to see you know I don&#39;t know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.369" end="00:51:21.849" style="s2">of people don&#39;t realize this but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.479" end="00:51:22.529" style="s2">word capital simply means tools that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.849" end="00:51:25.539" style="s2">all it means</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.529" end="00:51:27.039" style="s2">so one of the why we think of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.539" end="00:51:30.460" style="s2">being centered around money is because</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.039" end="00:51:32.920" style="s2">money is such a powerful tool really but</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.460" end="00:51:35.170" style="s2">all basically everything we use is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.920" end="00:51:38.650" style="s2">tool and everything we use is a tool of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.170" end="00:51:40.749" style="s2">production so if you think of a plastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.650" end="00:51:43.329" style="s2">bag for example that we repurpose well</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.749" end="00:51:46.089" style="s2">that&#39;s a tool so it&#39;s like the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.329" end="00:51:49.420" style="s2">capitalism that&#39;s capital and a tool is</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.089" end="00:51:51.400" style="s2">capital anything the technical term for</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.420" end="00:51:52.989" style="s2">capital is tools of production but when</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.400" end="00:51:54.039" style="s2">you think about that when I was well I</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.989" end="00:51:56.769" style="s2">thought about this and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.039" end="00:51:58.539" style="s2">actually redundant the term tools all</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.769" end="00:52:00.249" style="s2">tools are productive at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.539" end="00:52:03.279" style="s2">potentially because the term tools of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.249" end="00:52:06.309" style="s2">production is a is a redundant term it</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.279" end="00:52:08.979" style="s2">has it had the same meaning twice in us</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.309" end="00:52:11.019" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done it to me no so it</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.979" end="00:52:13.930" style="s2">all tools are tools of production so</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.019" end="00:52:16.569" style="s2">basically tools so capitalism is an</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.930" end="00:52:19.809" style="s2">ideology which is based on tools</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.569" end="00:52:21.759" style="s2">that&#39;s a template that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.809" end="00:52:24.069" style="s2">understand and and anybody who thinks</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.759" end="00:52:26.710" style="s2">that we you know tools aren&#39;t whatever</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.069" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">what has made things really work for us</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.710" end="00:52:32.109" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously extremely important you</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:34.809" style="s2">know not getting around it&#39;s simply a</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.109" end="00:52:37.660" style="s2">part of who we are so so so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.809" end="00:52:39.670" style="s2">integrate tools or what you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.660" end="00:52:41.969" style="s2">capitalism it&#39;s in some sense in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.670" end="00:52:49.869" style="s2">society we have to have this this</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.969" end="00:52:52.630" style="s2">dynamic creative force without without</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.869" end="00:52:57.880" style="s2">it without it being run by gangsters or</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.630" end="00:52:59.319" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s sort of a anyway that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.880" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">simple way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.319" end="00:53:04.599" style="s2">well I&#39;m thinking the bottom of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:07.150" style="s2">we&#39;re going a bit too far now I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.599" end="00:53:08.589" style="s2">what I think the bottom of my vision of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.150" end="00:53:11.079" style="s2">the bottom of all economics is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.589" end="00:53:12.400" style="s2">subsystems in other words it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.079" end="00:53:14.019" style="s2">monetary it might be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.400" end="00:53:15.519" style="s2">monetary but it&#39;s not very at the very</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.019" end="00:53:17.829" style="s2">bottom of place for example when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.519" end="00:53:19.509" style="s2">live in your house you don&#39;t pay some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.829" end="00:53:21.249" style="s2">them to to wash your dishes you wash</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.509" end="00:53:22.029" style="s2">your own dishes and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.249" end="00:53:24.309" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.029" end="00:53:25.719" style="s2">for which you don&#39;t get paid and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.309" end="00:53:27.939" style="s2">doing work which does not entail the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.719" end="00:53:29.439" style="s2">exchange of money and so that at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.939" end="00:53:31.989" style="s2">very base of our unit we have two</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.439" end="00:53:33.729" style="s2">children at the very base of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.989" end="00:53:35.859" style="s2">economic lies the enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.729" end="00:53:37.809" style="s2">work is done without the exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.859" end="00:53:40.989" style="s2">money and that&#39;s arguably the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.809" end="00:53:42.789" style="s2">important economic work and it&#39;s just to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.989" end="00:53:45.099" style="s2">me I think that it&#39;s only when you start</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.789" end="00:53:47.199" style="s2">to rise up in the hierarchy of economics</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.099" end="00:53:48.999" style="s2">that money gets involved and at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.199" end="00:53:50.409" style="s2">bottom there&#39;s all this work that being</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.999" end="00:53:52.299" style="s2">done which which is it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.409" end="00:53:53.849" style="s2">non-monetary and that you know the sex I</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.299" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">think I call that subsistence economy</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.849" end="00:53:58.269" style="s2">you know in other words my definition of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:54:02.199" style="s2">subsistence economy is economics which</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.269" end="00:54:04.809" style="s2">does not entail monetary exchange so if</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.199" end="00:54:06.879" style="s2">you think about this repurposing idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.809" end="00:54:11.379" style="s2">this reusable idea then you&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.879" end="00:54:13.029" style="s2">in extremely drag everybody doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.379" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">if we&#39;re haughty organized in</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.029" end="00:54:18.759" style="s2">neighborhoods so that for example the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:21.699" style="s2">travel in this big slot and the the wood</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.759" end="00:54:23.709" style="s2">the lumber goes here the wood near the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.699" end="00:54:26.499" style="s2">car tires go here the heavy metals go</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.709" end="00:54:29.199" style="s2">there these windows go here and then the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.499" end="00:54:31.989" style="s2">glass and all of this absolutely every</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.199" end="00:54:33.309" style="s2">scrap of it is necessarily reused</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.989" end="00:54:34.779" style="s2">because it&#39;s not allowed leaving the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.309" end="00:54:36.279" style="s2">neighborhood although you know just pile</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.779" end="00:54:37.479" style="s2">up there unless you means it so people</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.279" end="00:54:39.849" style="s2">figure out way to do it they make</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.479" end="00:54:42.039" style="s2">foundations they build houses use the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.849" end="00:54:43.899" style="s2">wind they use car windows to do put</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.039" end="00:54:45.129" style="s2">windows in their houses they do all kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.899" end="00:54:47.319" style="s2">of things they build their houses for</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.129" end="00:54:49.869" style="s2">free they figure out ways to green</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.319" end="00:54:52.779" style="s2">houses they grow their own food they in</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.869" end="00:54:56.139" style="s2">other words this develops progressively</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.779" end="00:54:57.809" style="s2">in a manner which they say here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.139" end="00:55:00.459" style="s2">the environmental side of all of us</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.809" end="00:55:03.489" style="s2">there&#39;s a real bigger argument that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.459" end="00:55:07.809" style="s2">real trick to the environment and to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.489" end="00:55:09.069" style="s2">biggest problem of --an damaging the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.809" end="00:55:13.659" style="s2">environment is containment</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.069" end="00:55:16.479" style="s2">we&#39;re not we throw our away we push</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.659" end="00:55:18.339" style="s2">it away and let it let it so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.479" end="00:55:20.199" style="s2">instead of containing absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.339" end="00:55:22.959" style="s2">everything and reusing it if we contain</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.199" end="00:55:25.239" style="s2">it and reuse it then it won&#39;t go it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.959" end="00:55:29.679" style="s2">not going to affect nature so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.239" end="00:55:32.019" style="s2">you know what I&#39;m saying there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.679" end="00:55:33.189" style="s2">idea about the future I&#39;ve know if</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.019" end="00:55:35.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve looked up indoor agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.189" end="00:55:38.200" style="s2">high-rise army yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.740" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">that&#39;s probably going to take off in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.200" end="00:55:42.130" style="s2">next few decades and cities are going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:44.230" style="s2">vertical firming you mean and things</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.130" end="00:55:46.089" style="s2">like that yeah Oh food is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.230" end="00:55:48.970" style="s2">built in heart in skyscrapers in cities</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.089" end="00:55:50.560" style="s2">and and that means that the all this</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.970" end="00:55:51.810" style="s2">land that&#39;s being used for agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.560" end="00:55:53.619" style="s2">would return to wilderness so the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.810" end="00:55:57.609" style="s2">animals are going to get their habitat</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.619" end="00:55:59.830" style="s2">back I think then this may happen very</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.609" end="00:56:02.320" style="s2">quickly and it may just be the the free</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.830" end="00:56:03.720" style="s2">market dynamics which will well have you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.320" end="00:56:05.619" style="s2">seen that video as when they</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.720" end="00:56:08.730" style="s2">reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.619" end="00:56:12.250" style="s2">National Park the entire you know that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.730" end="00:56:14.589" style="s2">it is amazing the entire ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.250" end="00:56:16.510" style="s2">regenerated because of the introduction</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.589" end="00:56:18.250" style="s2">of wolves oh really</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.510" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">there&#39;s this amazing video about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.250" end="00:56:23.589" style="s2">and you know because because and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">turns out that it turns out that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.589" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">not just you know it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:29.550" style="s2">plants it&#39;s you need to have these</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:34.570" style="s2">predatory animals to have a completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.550" end="00:56:36.369" style="s2">you know sound ecosystem and anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.570" end="00:56:41.470" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s oh yeah that would</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.369" end="00:56:44.320" style="s2">be that would be the future I think is</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.470" end="00:56:55.030" style="s2">yeah we why for this rewilding idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.320" end="00:56:57.400" style="s2">seems to be yeah but I do think I&#39;m much</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.030" end="00:56:59.260" style="s2">more I&#39;m really scared about mass</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.400" end="00:57:01.240" style="s2">redundancy about the fact that people</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.260" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">feel not only that they they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.240" end="00:57:06.130" style="s2">work but they have meaningless work oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:07.869" style="s2">yeah yeah well well I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.130" end="00:57:10.510" style="s2">optimistic thing is the meaningless jobs</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.869" end="00:57:12.460" style="s2">will go away right you know because</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.510" end="00:57:14.440" style="s2">there&#39;s people in China who are working</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.460" end="00:57:16.839" style="s2">for Fox carnot and they had to build a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.440" end="00:57:18.280" style="s2">net around the around the building</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.839" end="00:57:20.080" style="s2">because they were committing suicide I</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.280" end="00:57:22.530" style="s2">mean imagine the work conditions there</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.080" end="00:57:26.650" style="s2">and then the guy replaces them with</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.530" end="00:57:29.109" style="s2">robots and the robots you know do all</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.650" end="00:57:31.810" style="s2">these manual jobs you know they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.109" end="00:57:33.700" style="s2">getting crippled and but then they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.810" end="00:57:35.230" style="s2">have jobs so what are all these are all</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.700" end="00:57:42.490" style="s2">these hordes of people you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.230" end="00:57:44.790" style="s2">going to do precisely was putting</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.490" end="00:57:46.590" style="s2">together computers and iPhones and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.790" end="00:57:48.150" style="s2">and and that sort of thing and they had</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.590" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">these people living in these little</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.150" end="00:57:52.500" style="s2">dormitories with ten people you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:55.530" style="s2">that again the company you build a net</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.500" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">around because people are jumping out</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.530" end="00:58:02.250" style="s2">the window so that&#39;s just like okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:03.780" style="s2">then then so the robots they go the guy</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.250" end="00:58:07.140" style="s2">says oh we&#39;re gonna play we replace that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.780" end="00:58:08.430" style="s2">with robots well that&#39;s nice but then</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.140" end="00:58:10.890" style="s2">all these people are gonna be out of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.430" end="00:58:13.230" style="s2">job so so you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.890" end="00:58:15.270" style="s2">either way no what are people gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.230" end="00:58:17.430" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve heard statistics</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.270" end="00:58:18.660" style="s2">like ninety even the engineer jobs so</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.430" end="00:58:22.290" style="s2">that people are studying for right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.660" end="00:58:24.210" style="s2">like are gonna be done by other rhythms</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.290" end="00:58:27.450" style="s2">but so what the hell are people gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.210" end="00:58:29.220" style="s2">you know take acid or go to Burning Man</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.450" end="00:58:34.380" style="s2">festivals or I don&#39;t know what they get</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.220" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">to do yeah I&#39;m inclined to think Society</p>
