<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:14.610" style="s2">I really I really loved your book by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.270" end="00:00:20.240" style="s2">way and I thought it was very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.610" end="00:00:22.770" style="s2">very eloquent and I really like the I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.240" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">like the combination of this very</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.770" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">intimate personal observations with sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">of philosophy and and high abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:36.750" style="s2">and yeah the book was really for me an</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:41.130" style="s2">attempt to see the experience as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:45.240" style="s2">the becoming a young chess player and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.130" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">being highly driven to win so develop</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.240" end="00:00:51.230" style="s2">miss strong competitive urge which was</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:54.260" style="s2">also by advancement and identity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.230" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">personal growth and then at some point</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.260" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">partly through becoming a father partly</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:00.360" style="s2">through just growing up you know began</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">beginning to realize there were other</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.360" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">ways some of your life you know that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just about your next competitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">victory yeah so that was the book in</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">some ways is making sense of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2">different impulses on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:17.819" style="s2">natural competitive urge to win and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">being all that yeah then sort of saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.819" end="00:01:22.770" style="s2">goodbye to it as well so yeah what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">that there&#39;s this kind of paradox in</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.770" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">your character right this just being</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">extremely hyper competitive and almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">warrior like and actually what really</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">matters to you is is kids the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:39.749" style="s2">carrying aspect of of life on some level</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">possibly yeah so as you probably know</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.749" end="00:01:45.929" style="s2">you know the warrior archetype type is</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:47.869" style="s2">partly about a kind of sublimation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.929" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">partly about</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.869" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">finding something that&#39;s worth living</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:56.609" style="s2">for and focusing all your energy on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:02:00.229" style="s2">and mobilizing and as it&#39;s more for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.609" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">end so that that spirit of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.229" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">single-minded attention I you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">got a lot of respect for a lot I see it</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">in people I I see its power</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">I see how it can forge great progress</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">I see how it can cut through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:17.940" style="s2">noise you know I admire it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:21.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a necessary energy in the world I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.940" end="00:02:23.660" style="s2">also think there&#39;s more to life and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.110" end="00:02:26.600" style="s2">something somewhere along the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.660" end="00:02:29.150" style="s2">that ceased to make as much sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.600" end="00:02:31.880" style="s2">that desire I remember one time being in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.150" end="00:02:32.930" style="s2">a hotel room in Spain and I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.880" end="00:02:34.820" style="s2">this in the booth and just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.930" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">trying to sort of get ready for the next</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.820" end="00:02:37.850" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:40.190" style="s2">trying to find that warrior who wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.850" end="00:02:43.100" style="s2">to win and wanted to win the tournament</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.190" end="00:02:46.280" style="s2">and beat the guy next and I just noticed</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.100" end="00:02:48.170" style="s2">that that wasn&#39;t me anymore I still</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.280" end="00:02:52.130" style="s2">respected it I could still justify</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.170" end="00:02:53.390" style="s2">pretend to be that person but I began to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.130" end="00:02:56.960" style="s2">think there are bigger battles to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.390" end="00:03:00.110" style="s2">fought in one so do you think being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.960" end="00:03:02.810" style="s2">full-on warrior has more to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.110" end="00:03:05.060" style="s2">grace of learning how to lose up in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.810" end="00:03:08.960" style="s2">sense or learning how to be broken or</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.060" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">learning how to lose gracefully because</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.960" end="00:03:16.670" style="s2">none of us sort of rise to the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">you know image of ourself well become</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.670" end="00:03:21.410" style="s2">the divine double there&#39;s a word that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">John for Vicky was using and so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.410" end="00:03:25.820" style="s2">always fall short of that aren&#39;t on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:28.790" style="s2">human level and becoming human in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.820" end="00:03:31.940" style="s2">sense has to do with failure as much as</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.790" end="00:03:35.320" style="s2">is right yes so there&#39;s as you probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.940" end="00:03:37.640" style="s2">know in the book the moves of Master</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.320" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">there was a little bit of a nasty heroic</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.640" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">side to it it&#39;s partly about me coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:45.230" style="s2">to terms with the fact that I was never</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:48.020" style="s2">going to be world champion and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.230" end="00:03:49.490" style="s2">really ever try or ever have a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.020" end="00:03:52.580" style="s2">serious chance at that but there were</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.490" end="00:03:54.140" style="s2">many moments of inflection when after a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.580" end="00:03:56.630" style="s2">particularly big tournament or a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.140" end="00:03:59.420" style="s2">run I might have got ideas that oh maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.630" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">I can go all the way but at some point</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.420" end="00:04:04.100" style="s2">you kind of reach your limitations you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:05.780" style="s2">play people and you know that that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.100" end="00:04:07.640" style="s2">no accident that you lost that game you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.780" end="00:04:09.050" style="s2">know you may learn you may play a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.640" end="00:04:11.450" style="s2">better next time but there are clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.050" end="00:04:13.570" style="s2">limitations and I think that&#39;s true in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.450" end="00:04:16.340" style="s2">almost any dimension of life you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.570" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">better philosophers better activists</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.340" end="00:04:21.260" style="s2">better fathers you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:23.660" style="s2">it&#39;s something about growing up that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.260" end="00:04:25.880" style="s2">you come to appreciate your strengths</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.660" end="00:04:28.430" style="s2">and weaknesses and get to know yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.880" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">a bit better as a result for me in chess</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.430" end="00:04:33.229" style="s2">it was something about letting go of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:35.270" style="s2">that ultimate desire to be more easy</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.229" end="00:04:37.340" style="s2">with what had happened right</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.270" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">is it also something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.340" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">at one point deciding to let go of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:45.860" style="s2">a specialist in one field I know in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:47.570" style="s2">20s I wanted to be a songwriter it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.860" end="00:04:50.660" style="s2">like I was driven to that it was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.570" end="00:04:52.910" style="s2">only thing I cared about and then at one</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.660" end="00:04:55.580" style="s2">point I I came to the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.910" end="00:04:57.260" style="s2">you know I you know I got married and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:05:01.040" style="s2">all these other things happen to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.260" end="00:05:03.560" style="s2">which made it impossible to be so one</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.040" end="00:05:06.620" style="s2">pointedly devoted to that one goal and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.560" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">my life became more diverse and rich but</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.620" end="00:05:12.050" style="s2">but I I couldn&#39;t concentrate on that one</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:15.140" style="s2">thing to the degree that I I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.050" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">so is that yes that&#39;s very pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.140" end="00:05:21.140" style="s2">because it reminds me of the quotation I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:23.300" style="s2">think by Joseph Campbell you know you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.140" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">asked which myth are you living by yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.300" end="00:05:28.640" style="s2">and I think in the case of my younger</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:30.860" style="s2">self this single pointed attention this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.640" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">mobilized the will and the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.860" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">soul of the mind to get as good as</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:37.730" style="s2">possible at this one thing chess and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">that was very much part of the story it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.730" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">was about let me show the world that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:44.540" style="s2">can focus let me show the world that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:46.700" style="s2">can dedicate myself to this through</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.540" end="00:05:49.910" style="s2">discipline and there&#39;s a lot of self</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.700" end="00:05:51.740" style="s2">love in that for good and bad you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.910" end="00:05:54.470" style="s2">there was a sort of genuine discipline</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.740" end="00:05:55.430" style="s2">information of character with you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.470" end="00:05:58.340" style="s2">without chess that wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.430" end="00:06:00.860" style="s2">happened another hand you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.340" end="00:06:02.210" style="s2">monomania that sense that a I was really</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.860" end="00:06:04.610" style="s2">important being the game is really</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.210" end="00:06:07.790" style="s2">important and see the next game and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.610" end="00:06:10.340" style="s2">next move really mattered these were all</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.790" end="00:06:12.700" style="s2">kind of part of a myth you know and at</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.340" end="00:06:15.470" style="s2">some point you&#39;re getting to realize</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.700" end="00:06:17.090" style="s2">you&#39;re telling the story of yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.470" end="00:06:21.620" style="s2">there are other ways of telling that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.090" end="00:06:24.530" style="s2">story so yes marriage was part of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.620" end="00:06:26.600" style="s2">doing you know my educational activities</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.530" end="00:06:29.990" style="s2">was part of the chess was always a kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.600" end="00:06:32.450" style="s2">of plan B even when I didn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.990" end="00:06:34.070" style="s2">a plan a you know it was like I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.450" end="00:06:36.140" style="s2">know what planning it was yet but I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.070" end="00:06:37.400" style="s2">knew that chess wasn&#39;t it it was more</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.140" end="00:06:39.950" style="s2">like what I was doing when it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.400" end="00:06:41.750" style="s2">doing something else interesting I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.950" end="00:06:44.210" style="s2">thinking as you were talking about my</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.750" end="00:06:46.670" style="s2">recent discussion with with Zack and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.210" end="00:06:48.620" style="s2">John and we talked about this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.670" end="00:06:50.330" style="s2">the divine double and towards the end of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.620" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.330" end="00:06:54.710" style="s2">Zach was mentioning that the divine</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:56.540" style="s2">double is multiple it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.710" end="00:06:58.750" style="s2">just one it&#39;s us you&#39;re not just one</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.540" end="00:07:01.100" style="s2">person you&#39;re many different people</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.750" end="00:07:02.390" style="s2">you&#39;re many different archetypes that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.100" end="00:07:03.950" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to become and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.390" end="00:07:06.110" style="s2">often in conflict with each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.950" end="00:07:08.120" style="s2">absolutely so maybe when you&#39;re younger</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.110" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">you&#39;re focused towards just that one and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.120" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">then when you get older you you you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.130" end="00:07:18.170" style="s2">this you have a wider view of all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:20.230" style="s2">so I mean we did you know I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.170" end="00:07:23.210" style="s2">that sign is roughly right and um I</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.230" end="00:07:25.580" style="s2">actually watched that conversation and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.210" end="00:07:28.670" style="s2">know that quite well and the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.580" end="00:07:33.020" style="s2">the psyche is clurel is worth just</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.670" end="00:07:37.070" style="s2">taking a while to sit with because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.020" end="00:07:39.640" style="s2">plural in several different ways like</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.070" end="00:07:43.850" style="s2">speaking in quite a sort of archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.640" end="00:07:47.420" style="s2">maybe post Union kind of way yeah um and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.850" end="00:07:49.970" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to say that I think once you</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.420" end="00:07:51.260" style="s2">go into the into the psyche more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.970" end="00:07:54.590" style="s2">you find that there are these competing</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.260" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">energies and then the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.590" end="00:07:58.940" style="s2">who is observing them who&#39;s mediating</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:01.670" style="s2">between them is there such a thing is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.940" end="00:08:04.580" style="s2">the self just that conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.670" end="00:08:07.790" style="s2">your for example your warrior your</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.580" end="00:08:10.040" style="s2">wizard your your dysfunctional child</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.790" end="00:08:12.350" style="s2">your you know whatever else your</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.040" end="00:08:14.390" style="s2">masculine and feminine that&#39;s be even</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.350" end="00:08:16.760" style="s2">more basically your consumer and your</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.390" end="00:08:18.350" style="s2">shopper and your cleaner and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.760" end="00:08:22.310" style="s2">the past the parts of you that are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.350" end="00:08:24.740" style="s2">so you know exalted or mysterious yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.310" end="00:08:27.710" style="s2">and they&#39;re all kind of battling it out</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.740" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">to be who you are and sometimes it feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.710" end="00:08:31.130" style="s2">like the right version of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:34.130" style="s2">prevails and sometimes it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:36.110" style="s2">you know and but what was what was there</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.130" end="00:08:38.870" style="s2">what what where think Zach and John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:40.600" style="s2">conversation was going at least that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.870" end="00:08:42.770" style="s2">where my mind was taking it was um</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.600" end="00:08:46.700" style="s2">there&#39;s this question of the witness you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.770" end="00:08:49.850" style="s2">know who is observing this plural psyche</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.700" end="00:08:51.980" style="s2">mm-hmm does it make sense is the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.850" end="00:08:54.350" style="s2">just floral is it are we merely a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.980" end="00:08:55.520" style="s2">conversation or is there a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.350" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">which someone&#39;s witnessing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.520" end="00:09:00.620" style="s2">conversation or something Nora all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:03.140" style="s2">this got me intrigued you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.620" end="00:09:06.200" style="s2">well I remember the the mystic kerchief</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.140" end="00:09:07.940" style="s2">says man is legion but he also said</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.200" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">there should be one sort of central</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.940" end="00:09:13.430" style="s2">controller who&#39;s looking at those other</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:14.990" style="s2">multiple personalities and and is in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.430" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">control and saying you should do this or</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.990" end="00:09:17.750" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t buy this otherwise we get</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:22.280" style="s2">swept away all right we can and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.750" end="00:09:24.710" style="s2">Boston accounts true true on yet that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.280" end="00:09:27.410" style="s2">looks looks scarier they like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.710" end="00:09:30.290" style="s2">old-fashioned review of a Cartesian cell</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.410" end="00:09:31.670" style="s2">with in Jakarta right so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:33.500" style="s2">view I think it might be more mystical</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.670" end="00:09:37.880" style="s2">than that it might be that those</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.500" end="00:09:40.490" style="s2">archetypal cells that are somehow in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.880" end="00:09:42.380" style="s2">psyche conversing among themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.490" end="00:09:45.260" style="s2">competing and collaborating in various</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.380" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">ways I suspect the holding pattern for</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.260" end="00:09:53.570" style="s2">them is something transpersonal it may</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:55.460" style="s2">even be spirit in some sense or there</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.570" end="00:09:58.790" style="s2">are lots of words for it being or you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.460" end="00:10:01.520" style="s2">know God or you know but something</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.790" end="00:10:02.870" style="s2">that&#39;s not merely personality but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.520" end="00:10:07.130" style="s2">want something to be on the personality</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.870" end="00:10:09.410" style="s2">right that seems very important that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.130" end="00:10:12.290" style="s2">seems to me that we that there&#39;s a need</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.410" end="00:10:14.660" style="s2">to connect with that in the modern times</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.290" end="00:10:17.450" style="s2">where we&#39;re so obsessed with personality</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.660" end="00:10:19.100" style="s2">or so ups you know yeah so I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.450" end="00:10:21.530" style="s2">with the you mentioned a spiritual eyes</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.100" end="00:10:24.590" style="s2">boom I think my favorite single line</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.530" end="00:10:27.730" style="s2">perhaps there were several about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.590" end="00:10:31.450" style="s2">spirituality is was from the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.730" end="00:10:33.800" style="s2">psychoanalyst mark Epstein and he says</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.450" end="00:10:36.890" style="s2">spirituality is whatever it takes you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.800" end="00:10:41.690" style="s2">beyond the personality yeah I find that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.890" end="00:10:43.190" style="s2">quite astute and it stayed with me a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.690" end="00:10:45.230" style="s2">little bit hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.190" end="00:10:49.700" style="s2">because I guess the personality you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.230" end="00:10:51.470" style="s2">develop it you can develop it a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.700" end="00:10:54.860" style="s2">it still remains a prison if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.470" end="00:10:57.530" style="s2">go beyond that on some level yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.860" end="00:11:00.110" style="s2">the most beautiful is I mean I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.530" end="00:11:01.880" style="s2">speak from personal experience as such</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.110" end="00:11:05.450" style="s2">but I think somewhere in my book I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.880" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">mentioned this there&#39;s a quite a well</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.450" end="00:11:10.190" style="s2">well-worn line that says you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:12.199" style="s2">somebody before you can be nobody mmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.190" end="00:11:14.810" style="s2">the contention is that some ourself has</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.199" end="00:11:17.629" style="s2">to be constructed and coherent for some</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.810" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">extent before it&#39;s needed yeah and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.629" end="00:11:22.579" style="s2">you go straight towards deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:25.910" style="s2">you just have this chaos and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.579" end="00:11:29.240" style="s2">that line is good but what what a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.910" end="00:11:32.360" style="s2">twist on it I think is that you find</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.240" end="00:11:34.699" style="s2">that when you meet the nobodies were the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.360" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">advanced spiritual practitioners that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.699" end="00:11:39.560" style="s2">the people considered wise yeah and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:41.480" style="s2">actually have radiant personalities</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.560" end="00:11:43.430" style="s2">it&#39;s just that it&#39;s sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.480" end="00:11:47.139" style="s2">self-consciously held anymore it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.430" end="00:11:49.670" style="s2">of it&#39;s it&#39;s there but it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.139" end="00:11:52.790" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer a project you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:55.339" style="s2">no longer fear-based review based and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.790" end="00:11:56.990" style="s2">it&#39;s not great it&#39;s not trying it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.339" end="00:11:59.720" style="s2">adapting to the world not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.990" end="00:12:02.439" style="s2">using this personality as a kind of tool</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.720" end="00:12:04.730" style="s2">to filter out experience it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.439" end="00:12:07.850" style="s2">once they&#39;ve gone beyond the need to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.730" end="00:12:14.420" style="s2">that they still show up with their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.850" end="00:12:16.699" style="s2">quirks and yeah you know yeah so at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.420" end="00:12:19.060" style="s2">risk of sounding sentimental it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.699" end="00:12:21.500" style="s2">everything I guess the most developed</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.060" end="00:12:25.130" style="s2">being would be the one who is just at</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.500" end="00:12:29.029" style="s2">service to the world in in love if I</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.130" end="00:12:30.620" style="s2">could say that yeah well quiet although</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.029" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">like you say the risk of sentimentality</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.620" end="00:12:36.110" style="s2">you know where you know where are we</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:39.860" style="s2">with that because I&#39;m yeah I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.110" end="00:12:41.870" style="s2">wanting to say things like love is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.860" end="00:12:44.149" style="s2">fundamental significance find out what</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.870" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">you can serve and so forth but then we</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.149" end="00:12:47.990" style="s2">live in such a self-conscious culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:50.089" style="s2">that I also think well that sounds a bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.990" end="00:12:53.240" style="s2">worthy you know yeah and love has such a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.089" end="00:12:57.110" style="s2">kind of gross when we talk about love it</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.240" end="00:12:58.819" style="s2">has a sentimental flavor to it whereas</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.110" end="00:13:01.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a fierceness to it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.819" end="00:13:03.319" style="s2">directness to it there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.370" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a softness there&#39;s both aspects</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.319" end="00:13:09.199" style="s2">like yes yes doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:11.000" style="s2">sentimental or sappy or no formal sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.199" end="00:13:12.769" style="s2">that I I mean or in the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.000" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">person you&#39;re talking about who has</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.769" end="00:13:16.939" style="s2">embodied that you know I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.860" style="s2">love properly understood is that which</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.939" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">brings us to tears you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.860" end="00:13:23.690" style="s2">the feeling we have when we sense we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.500" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">given our all and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.690" end="00:13:30.170" style="s2">they grateful and these kind of feelings</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:32.450" style="s2">of self overcoming but I&#39;m also reminded</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.170" end="00:13:34.010" style="s2">of the beautiful quotation by Martin</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.450" end="00:13:35.840" style="s2">Luther King about love and power you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.010" end="00:13:38.300" style="s2">probably know it but you know in essence</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.840" end="00:13:41.540" style="s2">he speaks about the problem with the</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.550" end="00:13:47.930" style="s2">absence of love and and love to be the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.670" end="00:13:49.700" style="s2">absence of power as if there were</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.930" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">somehow pull their opposites didn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.700" end="00:13:53.330" style="s2">call it soul power or something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">that yeah possibly that made me</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.330" end="00:13:56.690" style="s2">somewhere else but but he has a famous</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:58.280" style="s2">quotation I didn&#39;t spiritual eyes and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.690" end="00:14:00.230" style="s2">might even a my even if put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.280" end="00:14:02.030" style="s2">mousse that matter because I liked it so</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.230" end="00:14:04.370" style="s2">much but he just says the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.030" end="00:14:07.310" style="s2">our time is bringing love and power</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.370" end="00:14:10.640" style="s2">together hmm and figuring out what that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.310" end="00:14:12.980" style="s2">means and it&#39;s an ongoing project but</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.640" end="00:14:15.890" style="s2">it&#39;s it is about what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.980" end="00:14:19.100" style="s2">love and serve the world at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.890" end="00:14:21.020" style="s2">whereas yeah sorry to interrupt I</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.100" end="00:14:23.810" style="s2">thought that might be a good segue to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.020" end="00:14:27.620" style="s2">talk about your let&#39;s say your activism</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.810" end="00:14:30.790" style="s2">or your interest in kind of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.620" end="00:14:32.510" style="s2">bringing spirituality into politics</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.790" end="00:14:34.400" style="s2">uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.510" end="00:14:35.720" style="s2">so I want to ask you about that partly</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.400" end="00:14:39.950" style="s2">because it&#39;s a weakness</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.720" end="00:14:42.350" style="s2">in my own life is that I I tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.950" end="00:14:44.990" style="s2">apolitical and I tend to think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.350" end="00:14:47.450" style="s2">weakness of my mind and maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.990" end="00:14:49.400" style="s2">help me with that how do I have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.450" end="00:14:55.870" style="s2">spiritual how do we bring spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.400" end="00:14:55.870" style="s2">into actual like political action well</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.650" end="00:15:04.520" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about this for at</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.660" end="00:15:06.140" style="s2">least five years now and the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.520" end="00:15:09.110" style="s2">I would say is that I fight I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.140" end="00:15:12.440" style="s2">without without wanting to finesse the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.110" end="00:15:15.170" style="s2">term too much and having used the word</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.440" end="00:15:16.340" style="s2">spirituality for several years I began</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.170" end="00:15:19.850" style="s2">to realize there was something</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.340" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">problematic not about the reference to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.850" end="00:15:27.380" style="s2">the spiritual not about a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:29.870" style="s2">practice or spiritual experience or even</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.380" end="00:15:33.100" style="s2">spiritual knowledge or beliefs but</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.870" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">spirituality as a complex composite nine</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.100" end="00:15:37.510" style="s2">he&#39;s actually a deeply problematic term</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:39.970" style="s2">it&#39;s misleading yeah you say</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.510" end="00:15:42.670" style="s2">spirituality you&#39;re placing it in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.970" end="00:15:45.550" style="s2">world of tables and chairs as a thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.670" end="00:15:48.130" style="s2">that exists in the world with its own</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.550" end="00:15:50.170" style="s2">objective reality it also has a Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.130" end="00:15:52.570" style="s2">flavor doesn&#39;t it it&#39;s dividing spirit</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.170" end="00:15:54.550" style="s2">from matter or right there&#39;s that food</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.570" end="00:15:56.110" style="s2">and then and people get consumed some</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.550" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">breathing people get concerned about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.110" end="00:16:01.950" style="s2">because it they&#39;re concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:07.930" style="s2">spiritualism and spirits and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.950" end="00:16:09.640" style="s2">metaphysical features of the term so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.930" end="00:16:11.080" style="s2">first thing they say is that I tend</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.640" end="00:16:13.210" style="s2">these days to refer to spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.080" end="00:16:15.460" style="s2">sensibility and the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.210" end="00:16:17.230" style="s2">cultivating that what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.460" end="00:16:20.860" style="s2">have spiritual sensibility and by that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.230" end="00:16:23.770" style="s2">mean a kind of feature of how we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.860" end="00:16:27.520" style="s2">disposed to be and to one extent that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.770" end="00:16:29.650" style="s2">push our inquiry to the the you know our</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.520" end="00:16:32.980" style="s2">cosmological framework as a whole our</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.650" end="00:16:37.210" style="s2">deepest values are strongest and most</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.980" end="00:16:39.160" style="s2">resonant experiences so when I say</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.210" end="00:16:42.370" style="s2">spiritual sensibility I mean a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.160" end="00:16:44.590" style="s2">feature of how we relate to the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.370" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.590" end="00:16:48.670" style="s2">sensibility isn&#39;t any sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:50.740" style="s2">controversial although although is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.670" end="00:16:53.140" style="s2">required so have spiritual sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.740" end="00:16:55.240" style="s2">is to be interested in the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.140" end="00:16:58.150" style="s2">life yeah to be interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.240" end="00:17:01.780" style="s2">cultivation of virtue and to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.150" end="00:17:03.460" style="s2">interested in the nature of reality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.780" end="00:17:05.320" style="s2">and most people have these things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.460" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">just that at any given moment we happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.320" end="00:17:09.189" style="s2">to greater or lesser extent but religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:15.390" style="s2">seems to be the thing that&#39;s problematic</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.189" end="00:17:15.390" style="s2">these days I mean right right so yes and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.689" end="00:17:19.480" style="s2">when I was doing the spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.680" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">project it was an anthropologists called</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.480" end="00:17:23.320" style="s2">Matthew angle in the room in one of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.329" style="s2">workshops and I&#39;ll never forget the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.320" end="00:17:27.310" style="s2">moment where we were floundering around</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.329" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">with definitions and you know what is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.310" end="00:17:32.460" style="s2">about spiritual and my spirituality why</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:35.230" style="s2">is it a problem and he says well guys</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.460" end="00:17:39.970" style="s2">the word spiritual has a history and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.230" end="00:17:41.860" style="s2">that history has a politics hmm and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.970" end="00:17:44.220" style="s2">is art of a matter of spirituality is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.860" end="00:17:48.660" style="s2">closely related to religion which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.220" end="00:17:48.660" style="s2">deeply political and historical and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.320" end="00:17:54.430" style="s2">so we&#39;ve come a bit off the original</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.540" end="00:17:56.620" style="s2">question so let me try and weave this</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.430" end="00:18:00.780" style="s2">back to that okay by the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.620" end="00:18:04.900" style="s2">between the spiritual and the political</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.780" end="00:18:06.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like this if you without getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.900" end="00:18:09.970" style="s2">too deep into the diagnosis of the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.810" end="00:18:14.680" style="s2">we have a certain kind of political</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.970" end="00:18:17.770" style="s2">economy in advanced Western world we</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.680" end="00:18:18.730" style="s2">have a certain kind of social imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.770" end="00:18:21.100" style="s2">which is something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.730" end="00:18:25.050" style="s2">consumerism and individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.100" end="00:18:28.300" style="s2">personal freedom and ownership</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.050" end="00:18:30.190" style="s2">it&#39;s about nation-state it&#39;s about legal</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.300" end="00:18:31.030" style="s2">systems you know we have certain notions</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.190" end="00:18:34.330" style="s2">of what&#39;s normal</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.030" end="00:18:36.130" style="s2">yeah and we&#39;ve also gone through a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.330" end="00:18:38.380" style="s2">historical period where we decided that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.130" end="00:18:41.830" style="s2">the ideological battle was somehow won</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.380" end="00:18:44.740" style="s2">and the and that liberal democratic</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.830" end="00:18:47.530" style="s2">capitalism broadly conceived was somehow</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.740" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">the answer the end of history right so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.530" end="00:18:50.260" style="s2">sometimes even joke on the end of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:55.000" style="s2">history that were all fukuyama&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.260" end="00:18:58.990" style="s2">children right I also mean that I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.000" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">and I and many people sort of similar</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.990" end="00:19:04.630" style="s2">age grew up thinking that we may have</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:06.460" style="s2">reached the end of history or at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.630" end="00:19:09.700" style="s2">at least that was a condemned at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.460" end="00:19:11.380" style="s2">it was a possibility I&#39;m not sure I ever</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.700" end="00:19:13.450" style="s2">really bought it but clearly that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.380" end="00:19:15.790" style="s2">the case today well also can I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.450" end="00:19:17.830" style="s2">interject also we have we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.790" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">through post-modernism which has been a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.830" end="00:19:24.060" style="s2">critique of everything so we believe but</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:26.530" style="s2">we don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.060" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a modern project and then Jack</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.530" end="00:19:31.930" style="s2">calls it the I think he called the book</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:33.820" style="s2">tragic tragic yeah yeah yeah well so</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.930" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s too much to talk about but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.820" end="00:19:40.330" style="s2">the way I we we ever try and complete</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:45.570" style="s2">the initial point is that um what change</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.330" end="00:19:49.330" style="s2">really was waking up to the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.570" end="00:19:50.830" style="s2">ecology technology and finance and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.330" end="00:19:55.210" style="s2">could get lost in that but in essence</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.830" end="00:19:58.299" style="s2">logical constraints ecological collapse</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.210" end="00:20:00.759" style="s2">finance sort of subverting and we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.299" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">of the economy and your kind marketing</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.759" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">version is like the market stall where</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:06.249" style="s2">people are trading goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:07.509" style="s2">and some are getting prosperous and some</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.249" end="00:20:10.119" style="s2">are having their needs met right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.509" end="00:20:11.619" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna fool capitalism yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.119" end="00:20:15.570" style="s2">what we have today is something more</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.619" end="00:20:21.869" style="s2">like surveillance extractive</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.570" end="00:20:24.129" style="s2">kleptocratic plutocratic data-driven</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.869" end="00:20:27.460" style="s2">inequality driving socially corrosive</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.129" end="00:20:29.139" style="s2">capitalism right not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.460" end="00:20:30.729" style="s2">underlying logic of the market is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.139" end="00:20:33.909" style="s2">problematic it&#39;s something about what</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.729" end="00:20:35.139" style="s2">this beast has become and then on top of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.909" end="00:20:37.629" style="s2">that you have the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.139" end="00:20:41.849" style="s2">technology which is implicated in both</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.629" end="00:20:43.659" style="s2">ecology and in finance but in essence</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.849" end="00:20:45.129" style="s2">technology is now changing within</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.659" end="00:20:47.259" style="s2">generations rather than just between</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.129" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">them so you have these these stabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.259" end="00:20:53.379" style="s2">influences right and in that context it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:56.049" style="s2">feels like the modernist project the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.379" end="00:20:58.529" style="s2">project that said look we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.049" end="00:21:02.769" style="s2">nation-states will have a free market</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.529" end="00:21:05.379" style="s2">the individual has certain rights well</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.769" end="00:21:06.940" style="s2">have private property every will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.379" end="00:21:09.309" style="s2">alright go about your business right</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.940" end="00:21:11.409" style="s2">that world is sort of broken but no one</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.309" end="00:21:14.879" style="s2">that&#39;s free has been proven to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.409" end="00:21:17.379" style="s2">inadequate yeah especially today with</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.879" end="00:21:19.539" style="s2">coronavirus oh my god I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.379" end="00:21:24.249" style="s2">want to bring that in too much but but</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.539" end="00:21:27.450" style="s2">that seems to be giving us a view of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.249" end="00:21:30.489" style="s2">limitations on all levels it&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.450" end="00:21:31.869" style="s2">it is incredible and Karuna I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.489" end="00:21:34.509" style="s2">come to that a second that is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.869" end="00:21:37.659" style="s2">a reckoning yeah the reckoning though</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.509" end="00:21:40.330" style="s2">prior to that even just you know look</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.659" end="00:21:41.799" style="s2">closely the climate science and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.330" end="00:21:44.049" style="s2">it&#39;s asking of us politically and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.799" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">realize it&#39;s going to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.049" end="00:21:50.200" style="s2">difficult to avoid much worse ecological</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:53.289" style="s2">cascading a lot right right look closely</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.200" end="00:21:55.659" style="s2">at the fact that the tech giants from</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.289" end="00:21:57.609" style="s2">Silicon Valley are now so powerful that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.659" end="00:22:00.220" style="s2">in effect the public realm was now</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.609" end="00:22:02.619" style="s2">controlled by private actors well and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.220" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">then look closely at how how finance</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.619" end="00:22:07.230" style="s2">serves the democratic system</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:09.300" style="s2">keeps perpetuating it in the way things</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.230" end="00:22:11.400" style="s2">are funded now none of these points I</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.300" end="00:22:13.790" style="s2">hasten to add are coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.400" end="00:22:16.350" style="s2">particularly socialistic communistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.790" end="00:22:19.170" style="s2">perspective mmm coming from someone who</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.350" end="00:22:21.000" style="s2">you know I&#39;m fairly political but to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.170" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">honest I couldn&#39;t really care who gets</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.000" end="00:22:25.470" style="s2">elected tomorrow or the next day yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:28.380" style="s2">little more like I want people to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.470" end="00:22:29.580" style="s2">kind of sane and less deluded and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.380" end="00:22:33.210" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of delusion baked</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.580" end="00:22:34.470" style="s2">into the system so when you ask me in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.210" end="00:22:37.260" style="s2">word of this virtue I&#39;ll have to come in</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.470" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">it comes in about getting beyond</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.260" end="00:22:43.290" style="s2">systemic delusion sort of see into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:45.390" style="s2">problems of the world but it&#39;s also by</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.290" end="00:22:49.470" style="s2">renewal so it&#39;s about where the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.390" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">resources conceptual experiential solar</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.470" end="00:22:56.010" style="s2">istic relational imaginative resources</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:58.650" style="s2">going to come from to survive and thrive</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.010" end="00:23:01.650" style="s2">for the next 100 years and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.650" end="00:23:04.980" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna come from deep places</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.650" end="00:23:06.510" style="s2">right indeed crusted places and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.980" end="00:23:09.330" style="s2">be spiritual and to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.510" end="00:23:11.340" style="s2">religious - yeah all I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.330" end="00:23:13.410" style="s2">thinking that I was thinking that people</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.340" end="00:23:15.270" style="s2">are talking about the end of religion I</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.410" end="00:23:20.520" style="s2">feel like we&#39;re at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.270" end="00:23:23.910" style="s2">religion in some level well this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.520" end="00:23:26.750" style="s2">interesting because I may be using this</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.910" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">have kind of evolved as I&#39;ve grown up</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.750" end="00:23:32.430" style="s2">about six or seven years ago when I back</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:34.560" style="s2">began the spirituality project at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.430" end="00:23:36.390" style="s2">Royal Society of Arts of London and just</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.560" end="00:23:39.590" style="s2">to give a bit of context that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.390" end="00:23:41.940" style="s2">relatively conventional enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.590" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">organisation and biking vengeful I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.940" end="00:23:45.420" style="s2">that and sort of an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:46.830" style="s2">cultural sense it&#39;s kind of a cutting</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.420" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">edge of the establishment but still the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.830" end="00:23:50.490" style="s2">establishment yeah and it&#39;s also fairly</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:53.970" style="s2">rationalistic and even a bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.490" end="00:23:55.500" style="s2">technocratic and in that context I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.970" end="00:24:00.570" style="s2">managed to raise the funds to create</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.500" end="00:24:02.160" style="s2">this project on rethinking spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.570" end="00:24:04.820" style="s2">on the basis of new understandings of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.160" end="00:24:07.590" style="s2">human nature the human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.820" end="00:24:09.260" style="s2">significantly more socialized</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.590" end="00:24:11.700" style="s2">significantly more automatic</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.260" end="00:24:13.410" style="s2">sufficiently more significantly more</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.700" end="00:24:16.500" style="s2">embodied than we previously thought and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.410" end="00:24:17.890" style="s2">by that I mean cognition is not not</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.500" end="00:24:19.540" style="s2">deliberative and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.890" end="00:24:23.549" style="s2">it&#39;s something much more about an</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.540" end="00:24:29.350" style="s2">organism trying to get by his group and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.549" end="00:24:31.960" style="s2">achieve his goals and so forth all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.350" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">which to say these new theories about</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.960" end="00:24:36.730" style="s2">what the human being is I thought should</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:39.220" style="s2">change our idea of what spiritual life</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.730" end="00:24:41.290" style="s2">was a back and at that time I could fast</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.220" end="00:24:43.570" style="s2">I did that because I thought religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.290" end="00:24:45.730" style="s2">was on the way I and yang&#39;s I thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.570" end="00:24:47.740" style="s2">like all of this old fashion of the gym</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.730" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">are absurd and quaint it seems now</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.740" end="00:24:53.230" style="s2">mm-hmm but then I had a bit of a you</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:56.350" style="s2">know a transformative set of encounters</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.230" end="00:24:58.210" style="s2">with lots of people some very divided</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">Christians became very close friends for</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.210" end="00:25:04.929" style="s2">example my wife&#39;s for the joy White&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:06.990" style="s2">him Indian and Hindu right um I began to</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.929" end="00:25:09.130" style="s2">look at that differently as a result too</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.990" end="00:25:10.620" style="s2">intellectually and relatively Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.130" end="00:25:13.030" style="s2">the books I&#39;m drawn to her a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.620" end="00:25:15.730" style="s2">about understanding the finer points of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.030" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">experience in the mind yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.730" end="00:25:19.540" style="s2">because of with the university for about</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.669" style="s2">seven or eight years I&#39;m quite skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.540" end="00:25:24.460" style="s2">you don&#39;t quite know I&#39;m not ticklin</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.669" end="00:25:26.140" style="s2">credulous I want to so that mixture of</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.460" end="00:25:28.530" style="s2">experiences made me think a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.140" end="00:25:32.380" style="s2">differently about religion namely that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.530" end="00:25:36.160" style="s2">you know we have this this extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.380" end="00:25:37.660" style="s2">historical gift yeah these resources and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.160" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">traditions and institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.660" end="00:25:41.770" style="s2">practices and the idea that that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">kind of old-fashioned hogwash yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.770" end="00:25:47.250" style="s2">know immature as hell well I feel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:50.890" style="s2">immature I was listening to this rabbi</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.250" end="00:25:53.140" style="s2">on YouTube that my life my wife likes to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.890" end="00:25:55.510" style="s2">listen to and he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.140" end="00:25:58.299" style="s2">following the Torah and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.510" end="00:26:00.520" style="s2">about how difficult that must be like</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.299" end="00:26:02.860" style="s2">what what a challenge it is to follow a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.520" end="00:26:05.500" style="s2">religious like a religious path you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.860" end="00:26:09.220" style="s2">deeply and we&#39;re almost too superficial</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.500" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">to do this or I shouldn&#39;t say we but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.220" end="00:26:16.419" style="s2">average North American or European we</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:19.210" style="s2">think we&#39;re so intelligent and wise and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.419" end="00:26:22.510" style="s2">advanced but we couldn&#39;t possibly follow</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.210" end="00:26:25.059" style="s2">the Torah you know anyway so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.510" end="00:26:27.500" style="s2">this extreme depth that comes along with</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.059" end="00:26:31.580" style="s2">following a religious path</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.500" end="00:26:34.370" style="s2">you know fully and I very much have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.580" end="00:26:38.090" style="s2">lot doing that even though I try to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.370" end="00:26:40.760" style="s2">know but irony irony of that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.090" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">that before you look too closely at it</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.760" end="00:26:46.610" style="s2">it can look as if the barrier to entry</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:48.740" style="s2">to experiences and practices and give me</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.610" end="00:26:50.150" style="s2">community and tradition it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.740" end="00:26:52.850" style="s2">surrendering your intellect right it can</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.150" end="00:26:54.350" style="s2">look to some people like alright I kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.850" end="00:26:55.700" style="s2">of like your community I quite like your</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.350" end="00:26:58.190" style="s2">songs I might even have a bit of your</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.700" end="00:26:59.930" style="s2">wine but don&#39;t give me any of that Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.190" end="00:27:02.810" style="s2">rose on the third day stuff right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.930" end="00:27:03.920" style="s2">but once you get to know the people a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.810" end="00:27:06.260" style="s2">bit better and spend a bit more time</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.920" end="00:27:08.690" style="s2">there you realize they&#39;re not that hung</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.260" end="00:27:10.910" style="s2">up on the beliefs you know it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.690" end="00:27:13.970" style="s2">comes into a more permeating set of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.910" end="00:27:15.980" style="s2">experiences in which those beliefs begin</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.970" end="00:27:18.290" style="s2">to be a bit more resonant and meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.980" end="00:27:19.990" style="s2">but it&#39;s not as if everything&#39;s driven</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.290" end="00:27:24.530" style="s2">by them at least not in the more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.990" end="00:27:26.750" style="s2">churches that I observed but I could</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.530" end="00:27:29.420" style="s2">also say it also appears that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.750" end="00:27:32.840" style="s2">lot of dead religion out there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.420" end="00:27:37.880" style="s2">just just propositional and and dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:40.310" style="s2">and unbearable and nice so I think</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.360" end="00:27:47.920" style="s2">that is like it&#39;s both right</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.220" end="00:27:53.210" style="s2">cultish spirit seems to be what will</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.020" end="00:27:56.150" style="s2">arise in all of this chaos that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.210" end="00:27:59.870" style="s2">well now but also also different</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.150" end="00:28:02.030" style="s2">communities of sense-making and but</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.870" end="00:28:05.240" style="s2">since making is you don&#39;t like that word</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.030" end="00:28:06.860" style="s2">I was your word for sense making I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.240" end="00:28:08.930" style="s2">trying to remember what it was there was</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.860" end="00:28:10.580" style="s2">no it&#39;s funny the second person today to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.930" end="00:28:15.010" style="s2">tell me I don&#39;t like that term must be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.580" end="00:28:19.150" style="s2">somehow out there but I&#39;m it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.010" end="00:28:21.410" style="s2">intelligibility I I kind of knew yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.150" end="00:28:23.780" style="s2">the chat we had a challenge of at</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.410" end="00:28:25.370" style="s2">intelligibility today to make to make</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.780" end="00:28:28.010" style="s2">sense of the world world but when people</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.370" end="00:28:30.440" style="s2">turn it into sense making you know good</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.010" end="00:28:32.030" style="s2">luck to them is fine it&#39;s not my concern</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.440" end="00:28:34.040" style="s2">we babbling a little peoples languages</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.030" end="00:28:35.780" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.040" end="00:28:37.820" style="s2">for me sense making sounds a bit funny</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.780" end="00:28:39.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit intellectual it sounds a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.820" end="00:28:41.090" style="s2">bit like Oh yellow we&#39;ll just do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.500" end="00:28:43.580" style="s2">and do this and we&#39;ll make sense and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.090" end="00:28:46.400" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna yeah it turns it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.580" end="00:28:48.020" style="s2">sound like you practice and I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.400" end="00:28:50.780" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean to be convinced that it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.020" end="00:28:52.250" style="s2">really is a practice perhaps it could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.780" end="00:28:54.560" style="s2">brass I just don&#39;t have the experiences</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.250" end="00:28:58.310" style="s2">that sense making process properly</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.560" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">understood may be worthy of that name</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.310" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">I haven&#39;t yet experienced it yet oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.180" end="00:29:08.380" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know if I answered your</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.170" end="00:29:11.960" style="s2">original original question fully but um</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.380" end="00:29:14.180" style="s2">the way guys sorry you&#39;re just say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.960" end="00:29:17.150" style="s2">I&#39;m in terms of whether religions coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.180" end="00:29:18.290" style="s2">back it&#39;s tricky right because it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.150" end="00:29:20.450" style="s2">depends on who you were talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.290" end="00:29:21.950" style="s2">and how old they are what they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.450" end="00:29:24.200" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.950" end="00:29:26.540" style="s2">for some people religion is still a big</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.200" end="00:29:28.340" style="s2">allergy you know it&#39;s still a religious</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.540" end="00:29:30.800" style="s2">people still means a potentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.340" end="00:29:33.050" style="s2">coercive source of authority who will</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.800" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">take away your freedom</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.050" end="00:29:38.930" style="s2">and what I realized quite recently</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:40.690" style="s2">actually and this this is where the two</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.930" end="00:29:43.910" style="s2">worlds intersect a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.690" end="00:29:47.630" style="s2">the term spirituality sometimes even</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.910" end="00:29:49.910" style="s2">called spiritual but not religious yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.630" end="00:29:51.860" style="s2">and the thing that&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.910" end="00:29:55.880" style="s2">that is it&#39;s an absurd expression right</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.860" end="00:29:58.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like being healthy but not medical</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.880" end="00:30:01.460" style="s2">or you know learning but not through</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.910" end="00:30:03.140" style="s2">education or something on that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.460" end="00:30:05.390" style="s2">got this kind of deinstitutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.140" end="00:30:07.460" style="s2">feel to it well I guess we need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.390" end="00:30:10.760" style="s2">define what religion means like to us</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.460" end="00:30:12.620" style="s2">and and what it really means you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.760" end="00:30:15.050" style="s2">rather than just being Christianity or</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.620" end="00:30:17.660" style="s2">Islam or you know what is Russell really</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.050" end="00:30:19.450" style="s2">mean I mean yeah I mean you have other</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.660" end="00:30:23.510" style="s2">authorities there you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.450" end="00:30:26.180" style="s2">relieve you when I heard Zack and John</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.510" end="00:30:29.210" style="s2">speaking about that before</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.180" end="00:30:32.660" style="s2">really you open meaning sort of the bind</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.210" end="00:30:34.940" style="s2">together or the need for communal</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.660" end="00:30:37.460" style="s2">practices which which lifts up the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.940" end="00:30:40.060" style="s2">spirit and lifts the spirit also gives</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.460" end="00:30:43.220" style="s2">you a kind of commitment device and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.060" end="00:30:46.370" style="s2">reinforced with discipline and give you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.220" end="00:30:48.269" style="s2">a whole point and renew your renew your</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.370" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.269" end="00:30:53.529" style="s2">that give you a certain tempo to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:56.529" style="s2">existence that structures your time and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.529" end="00:30:59.740" style="s2">attention that gives you clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.529" end="00:31:01.320" style="s2">purpose yeah is your social support you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.740" end="00:31:04.029" style="s2">know lots of things about religion are</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.320" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">fabulous and if you don&#39;t have that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.029" end="00:31:09.549" style="s2">you have a perverted version of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:12.429" style="s2">right often are usually or maybe always</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.549" end="00:31:13.929" style="s2">right it can manifest in other ways but</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.429" end="00:31:16.120" style="s2">here&#39;s the point I wanted to make it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.929" end="00:31:17.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a point I haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.120" end="00:31:19.899" style="s2">articulated public courses where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.559" end="00:31:22.590" style="s2">getting it right but it&#39;s like this why</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.899" end="00:31:26.289" style="s2">is it that some people are so allergic</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.590" end="00:31:28.779" style="s2">to the term spirituality there were</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.289" end="00:31:31.960" style="s2">several reasons but there&#39;s one that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.779" end="00:31:34.779" style="s2">would add which is that spirituality is</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.960" end="00:31:38.110" style="s2">really liberalism to tenants to have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.779" end="00:31:40.510" style="s2">spiritual life without yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.110" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">liberalism&#39;s way of saying we can have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.510" end="00:31:44.110" style="s2">all the good stuff that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:46.389" style="s2">all the good experiences yeah without</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.110" end="00:31:48.460" style="s2">the commitment without the commitment</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.389" end="00:31:50.860" style="s2">without the police based activities</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.460" end="00:31:53.380" style="s2">without the family and community</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.860" end="00:31:55.990" style="s2">commitment without the service we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.380" end="00:31:57.970" style="s2">gonna do the stuff that we enjoy is</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.990" end="00:32:00.010" style="s2">we&#39;re free agents and we can greater</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.970" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">like everyone that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.010" end="00:32:04.750" style="s2">that&#39;s all bound up in the Protestant</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:06.610" style="s2">the whole Protestant notion of just you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.750" end="00:32:08.740" style="s2">can make it up as you go along or you</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.610" end="00:32:11.350" style="s2">can have a direct relationship to God</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.740" end="00:32:12.750" style="s2">and you can have it all right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.350" end="00:32:16.630" style="s2">lose the church you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.750" end="00:32:18.820" style="s2">doctrine you don&#39;t need I&#39;m on you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.630" end="00:32:21.159" style="s2">even more on the edge of my competence</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.820" end="00:32:23.559" style="s2">than unusual but on the theology I I</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.159" end="00:32:25.720" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be sure but I imagine there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.559" end="00:32:27.399" style="s2">those who would say that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.720" end="00:32:29.889" style="s2">things that makes Protestant</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.399" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">Protestantism thus faint is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.889" end="00:32:34.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of sense making capacity</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:36.519" style="s2">can refer it on the agent but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.450" end="00:32:39.909" style="s2">completely untethered from institutional</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.519" end="00:32:43.240" style="s2">support or practice or beauty but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.909" end="00:32:45.010" style="s2">in its in it&#39;s pathological form maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.240" end="00:32:46.659" style="s2">it has a very good aspect to it the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.010" end="00:32:48.970" style="s2">self-critical aspect but it is in</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.659" end="00:32:52.059" style="s2">pathological format it leads to a kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.970" end="00:32:54.070" style="s2">of do-it-yourself spirituality consumer</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.059" end="00:32:55.779" style="s2">spirituality where you just get a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.070" end="00:32:57.490" style="s2">of techniques and you you stitch them</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.779" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">together and any patchwork that you like</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.490" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">and then you have a nice</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:04.100" style="s2">but they&#39;re you don&#39;t go very deep right</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">so here&#39;s here&#39;s where this point needs</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.100" end="00:33:09.740" style="s2">to be understood fully I think because</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">and when I was a bit younger I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.740" end="00:33:13.220" style="s2">have thought well what&#39;s wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:15.410" style="s2">you know like pick-and-mix great I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.220" end="00:33:18.620" style="s2">have an eclectic view why can&#39;t I take</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.410" end="00:33:22.250" style="s2">the best of the best and why can I trust</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.620" end="00:33:23.510" style="s2">myself to forge it and build my own life</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.250" end="00:33:27.380" style="s2">around it mhm</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.510" end="00:33:29.570" style="s2">so that&#39;s a good question and then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.380" end="00:33:31.549" style="s2">say to them well Luke that is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.570" end="00:33:34.580" style="s2">essence of much of the liberal project</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.549" end="00:33:36.289" style="s2">that&#39;s a blank slate ideology isn&#39;t it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.580" end="00:33:37.460" style="s2">mean well it&#39;s not just a blank slate I</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.289" end="00:33:38.750" style="s2">guess the point I&#39;m making is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.460" end="00:33:41.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a connection between the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.750" end="00:33:42.919" style="s2">individual desire to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.740" end="00:33:47.150" style="s2">liberalism&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.919" end="00:33:49.030" style="s2">failure and by that I mean these</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.150" end="00:33:51.289" style="s2">problems I mentioned earlier of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.030" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">Technology controlling the public realm</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.289" end="00:33:56.059" style="s2">private actors controlling the public</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:58.700" style="s2">realm cascading ecological collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.059" end="00:34:00.740" style="s2">kind of financial overreach in every</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.700" end="00:34:02.600" style="s2">aspect of our life leading to socially</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.740" end="00:34:05.270" style="s2">corrosive inequality democratic</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.600" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">breakdown and so forth those are all</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:12.109" style="s2">person says I want to do these things</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.730" end="00:34:14.210" style="s2">that&#39;s still caught up in the liberalist</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.109" end="00:34:16.060" style="s2">liberal is sort of liberal imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.210" end="00:34:19.940" style="s2">it&#39;s still caught up in this idea that</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.080" end="00:34:33.590" style="s2">but the answer is it&#39;s not working very</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.879" end="00:34:35.780" style="s2">well it&#39;s destroying society it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.590" end="00:34:36.830" style="s2">destroying the social fabric it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:40.010" style="s2">mean you go back to old-time religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.940" end="00:34:42.740" style="s2">and listen to the minister yeah but it</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.010" end="00:34:45.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean think twice the question is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.740" end="00:34:48.950" style="s2">maybe yeah so so how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.710" end="00:34:51.230" style="s2">how do you have a spiritual or let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.950" end="00:34:52.490" style="s2">religious life in the in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.230" end="00:34:53.830" style="s2">century that&#39;s kind of your question</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.490" end="00:34:58.030" style="s2">isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.830" end="00:35:00.040" style="s2">question really is how do we bring</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.030" end="00:35:04.390" style="s2">matters the fundamental concern to bear</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.040" end="00:35:06.340" style="s2">on in the public realm in a way that can</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.390" end="00:35:08.620" style="s2">make his publisher you know well but</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.340" end="00:35:11.230" style="s2">that word program is often used to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.620" end="00:35:13.120" style="s2">politics I guess I mean in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.230" end="00:35:15.990" style="s2">has a bearing on or the design of public</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.120" end="00:35:19.240" style="s2">policy and so to give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.990" end="00:35:22.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a big debate within economics</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.240" end="00:35:26.140" style="s2">about whether economic growth is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.180" end="00:35:28.870" style="s2">sustainable and whether in order to you</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.140" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">know cope on a finite planet some</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.870" end="00:35:35.140" style="s2">believe that we can progressively make</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:38.350" style="s2">economic production cleaner with green</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.140" end="00:35:42.220" style="s2">energy and renewable materials and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.350" end="00:35:44.200" style="s2">actually the they build the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.220" end="00:35:46.420" style="s2">growth grouse them growth the met sorry</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.200" end="00:35:50.530" style="s2">the gross domestic product yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.420" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">perpetuation and continued growth of GDP</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.530" end="00:35:56.200" style="s2">gross domestic product is possible and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:58.120" style="s2">that we and not only is it possible but</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.200" end="00:36:00.340" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of essential so the green</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.120" end="00:36:04.390" style="s2">growth advocates and that actually that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.340" end="00:36:05.980" style="s2">theory to some extent is the basis for</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.390" end="00:36:09.700" style="s2">the greening deal which is a big</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.980" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">political in the US and I don&#39;t based on</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.700" end="00:36:15.160" style="s2">growth mm-hmm right nobody some growth</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:16.840" style="s2">and and it gets to the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.160" end="00:36:20.500" style="s2">exactly is going on there what is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.840" end="00:36:23.020" style="s2">growth doing spiritually what sense is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.500" end="00:36:25.030" style="s2">it conferring reality on something in</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.020" end="00:36:28.090" style="s2">what sense does it make us feel real or</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.030" end="00:36:30.460" style="s2">make life meaningful do we actually need</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.090" end="00:36:33.580" style="s2">it and the reason that question matter</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.460" end="00:36:36.490" style="s2">is is that I think when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.580" end="00:36:38.920" style="s2">best models and Tim Jackson I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:36:52.270" end="00:36:57.640" style="s2">saying look look at the data look at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.300" end="00:37:00.340" style="s2">evidence it appears that there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.640" end="00:37:02.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong connection between one</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.340" end="00:37:05.230" style="s2">particular kind of economic growth and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.280" end="00:37:06.550" style="s2">ecological degradation this is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.230" end="00:37:08.830" style="s2">known this for a long time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.550" end="00:37:11.260" style="s2">continuing the link is there to what</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.830" end="00:37:14.590" style="s2">extent can you decouple them right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.260" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">the debate goes that there&#39;s no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.590" end="00:37:19.630" style="s2">you can decouple it in a relative sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:20.890" style="s2">so that every gaming unit is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.630" end="00:37:23.320" style="s2">cleaner and a bit better than the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.890" end="00:37:25.330" style="s2">previous one but there is a big argument</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.320" end="00:37:28.150" style="s2">over whether you can reduce it in an</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.330" end="00:37:30.610" style="s2">absolute sense and decouple it such that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.150" end="00:37:33.670" style="s2">in the globe as a whole we can carry on</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.610" end="00:37:35.230" style="s2">growing and reduce for instance</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.670" end="00:37:37.810" style="s2">emissions especially carbon emissions</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.230" end="00:37:40.660" style="s2">okay let&#39;s go back to coronavirus then</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.810" end="00:37:42.970" style="s2">maybe cuz you don&#39;t mind and you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.660" end="00:37:45.550" style="s2">you&#39;re sure excuse me I&#39;m just because</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.970" end="00:37:47.800" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary to make the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.550" end="00:37:50.020" style="s2">the work that I do and work a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.800" end="00:37:52.390" style="s2">people you speak to do is to connect</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.020" end="00:37:55.330" style="s2">sort of disciplines and paradigms and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.390" end="00:37:57.580" style="s2">contexts yeah and epistemologies takes a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.330" end="00:37:59.530" style="s2">bit of time right because you&#39;ve gotta</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.580" end="00:38:00.850" style="s2">unpack the stall and go the world&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.530" end="00:38:02.950" style="s2">then you forge a relationship then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.850" end="00:38:04.450" style="s2">analyze the relationship but in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.950" end="00:38:07.390" style="s2">case I&#39;m just saying that if you take</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.450" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">the growth of the bank it would appear</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.390" end="00:38:13.750" style="s2">that the argument will be foreign one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:16.690" style="s2">the level of persuasive policy reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.750" end="00:38:19.120" style="s2">like this for this if we have green</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.690" end="00:38:24.100" style="s2">girls will have this number of jobs we</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.120" end="00:38:26.290" style="s2">have you know you lower emissions and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.100" end="00:38:28.150" style="s2">this will be a good policy outcome right</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.290" end="00:38:30.790" style="s2">yeah if you have a more existential</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.150" end="00:38:33.160" style="s2">level about what are you actually living</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.790" end="00:38:36.580" style="s2">for what is the good Society what is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.160" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">good life right it&#39;s very far from clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.580" end="00:38:40.840" style="s2">that the growth model is the way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:43.570" style="s2">not even in a part of the discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.840" end="00:38:46.060" style="s2">like it&#39;s just about it&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.570" end="00:38:48.910" style="s2">let&#39;s say a building an engineering the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.060" end="00:38:52.360" style="s2">utopia right and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.910" end="00:38:55.240" style="s2">what&#39;s the meaning of this of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.360" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">like mmm-hmm and people I assume if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.240" end="00:38:59.080" style="s2">just build the Utopia then we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:02.890" style="s2">all figure out what the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.080" end="00:39:05.260" style="s2">is but I feel like even though there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.890" end="00:39:07.270" style="s2">coronavirus I&#39;m in a nice little house</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.270" end="00:39:13.050" style="s2">totally in a utopia right but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.940" end="00:39:13.050" style="s2">still have struggles</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.190" end="00:39:19.289" style="s2">sorry to make it personal I just mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.359" end="00:39:24.569" style="s2">let&#39;s come to the personal the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.289" end="00:39:27.210" style="s2">existential it matters it matters</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.569" end="00:39:29.519" style="s2">and it and it&#39;s been lost in the public</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.210" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">realm that&#39;s the kind of point and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.519" end="00:39:34.469" style="s2">language of the spiritual is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:36.469" style="s2">saying Luke C give your fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.469" end="00:39:40.049" style="s2">questions of what I call in the book</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.890" end="00:39:50.670" style="s2">what the fourth one is but anyway the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.509" end="00:39:52.410" style="s2">thing is these fundamental processes in</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.410" end="00:39:56.039" style="s2">were not going to resolve that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.789" end="00:39:57.650" style="s2">gonna like say okay here&#39;s the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.039" end="00:40:00.539" style="s2">of life and therefore we live like this</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.650" end="00:40:03.269" style="s2">but we do have to structure society in a</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.170" end="00:41:00.239" style="s2">night I just told us that we&#39;re at war</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.569" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">against at the virus so first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.239" end="00:41:05.219" style="s2">thought oh Jesus Christ it&#39;s like are</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:06.900" style="s2">you trying to be like de Gaulle or</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.219" end="00:41:10.229" style="s2">something and using this outdated</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.900" end="00:41:13.380" style="s2">rhetoric I think that the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.229" end="00:41:16.289" style="s2">is so stupid are on a spiritual level</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.380" end="00:41:18.269" style="s2">right right I mean we&#39;re at war against</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.289" end="00:41:20.519" style="s2">the virus it seems to me the opposite is</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.269" end="00:41:23.400" style="s2">true where we&#39;re gonna have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.519" end="00:41:25.050" style="s2">out how to make peaceful opera make</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.400" end="00:41:28.290" style="s2">peace with each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.050" end="00:41:30.120" style="s2">right away but well I&#39;m sorry for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.290" end="00:41:34.080" style="s2">rant but that&#39;s okay that&#39;s okay let u</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.120" end="00:41:37.260" style="s2">s-- plan it&#39;s a difficult one for many</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.080" end="00:41:39.960" style="s2">reasons but I mean there&#39;s a lot going</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.260" end="00:41:43.230" style="s2">on right so there&#39;s there&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.960" end="00:41:45.500" style="s2">Eva&#39;s why they want to loop it back best</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.230" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">way of doing this one of your previous</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.500" end="00:41:50.430" style="s2">discussions with Zack I believe he spoke</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:52.770" style="s2">a little bit about the educational</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.430" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">meta-crisis yeah and he spoke a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.770" end="00:41:57.690" style="s2">bit about forming questions he feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:59.550" style="s2">that our defining of our time so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.690" end="00:42:01.710" style="s2">kind of meta-crisis distilled of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.550" end="00:42:03.270" style="s2">four questions those are very much</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.710" end="00:42:05.670" style="s2">haters but they partly came about</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.270" end="00:42:08.460" style="s2">through conversations we we&#39;d had and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.670" end="00:42:11.640" style="s2">four questions really are what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.460" end="00:42:14.220" style="s2">on roughly which is a question of sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.640" end="00:42:16.770" style="s2">making or intelligibility is a question</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.220" end="00:42:19.380" style="s2">of are we up to it which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.770" end="00:42:21.600" style="s2">about capability then there&#39;s like who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.380" end="00:42:23.550" style="s2">in charge and who gets to decide which</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.600" end="00:42:26.040" style="s2">is a question of legitimacy or Zack</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.550" end="00:42:27.780" style="s2">calls of legitimation sometimes quoting</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.040" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">Hamas and then finally there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.780" end="00:42:32.250" style="s2">meaning or what&#39;s it all about what are</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:34.500" style="s2">we trying to do these four questions</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.250" end="00:42:36.690" style="s2">going to be superimposed on the virus</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.500" end="00:42:38.940" style="s2">sure do you want to go through them joy</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.690" end="00:42:41.460" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.940" end="00:42:44.150" style="s2">so I would say the intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.460" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">question what&#39;s going on is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.150" end="00:42:54.120" style="s2">doing that work reasonably well as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:55.470" style="s2">species I think it could be better but</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.120" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">there is a great deal of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.470" end="00:43:02.040" style="s2">going on and the challenge is not to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">rush to judgment about what is a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.040" end="00:43:09.420" style="s2">and bad response but nonetheless the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:12.360" style="s2">problem there is while you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.420" end="00:43:15.270" style="s2">sense of things what do you do right you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.360" end="00:43:17.130" style="s2">can&#39;t wait for a month to figure out get</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.270" end="00:43:19.530" style="s2">all the dates that you need to make the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.130" end="00:43:20.850" style="s2">fully informed judgment you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.530" end="00:43:22.710" style="s2">a decision often with incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.850" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">knowledge in the context of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.710" end="00:43:26.850" style="s2">yeah there the question is that comes</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:29.730" style="s2">into a question of underlying values I</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.850" end="00:43:31.620" style="s2">would say the first instinct should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.730" end="00:43:34.410" style="s2">care in the first instance should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.620" end="00:43:35.740" style="s2">kind of Caritas rather than Veritas you</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.410" end="00:43:39.410" style="s2">know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.740" end="00:43:41.780" style="s2">protect what you love and then figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:43:42.020" style="s2">out what the attack is what the threat</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.780" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.020" end="00:43:47.810" style="s2">so personally I think very early on when</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:50.120" style="s2">it became clear this was a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.810" end="00:43:51.740" style="s2">infectious disease a virus that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.120" end="00:43:55.010" style="s2">fatal for a small percentage of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.740" end="00:43:56.690" style="s2">population that would grow exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.010" end="00:43:59.810" style="s2">over time because of the early</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.690" end="00:44:02.240" style="s2">patterning of increase over weeks they</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.810" end="00:44:04.730" style="s2">missed the axis exponential curve kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.240" end="00:44:06.530" style="s2">of I think while they were able to deal</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.730" end="00:44:09.610" style="s2">with that yeah I didn&#39;t miss it or they</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.530" end="00:44:13.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what it meant or but I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.610" end="00:44:16.100" style="s2">rather than waiting to make perfect</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.400" end="00:44:17.740" style="s2">sense mmm what&#39;s way on here is highly</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.100" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">Hugh how does a human species as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.740" end="00:44:22.910" style="s2">deal with conditions of an epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">uncertainty where we&#39;re still looking to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.910" end="00:44:28.130" style="s2">authority to tell us what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:30.440" style="s2">what do we do but we can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.130" end="00:44:32.990" style="s2">really we can to some extent defer to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.440" end="00:44:35.930" style="s2">experts the son extent look for the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.990" end="00:44:38.060" style="s2">reliable sources but we still have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.930" end="00:44:39.980" style="s2">figure out for ourselves do I send my</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.060" end="00:44:44.570" style="s2">school son to school tomorrow or not</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.980" end="00:44:46.370" style="s2">yeah and do I do I go shopping once a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.570" end="00:44:47.990" style="s2">week is that safe or should I wait until</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.370" end="00:44:51.320" style="s2">you know who knows till it&#39;s all cleared</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.990" end="00:44:53.450" style="s2">up and these questions are ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.320" end="00:44:55.220" style="s2">ours to answer but they arise from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.450" end="00:44:58.190" style="s2">question to crisis of intelligibility of</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.220" end="00:45:00.260" style="s2">not knowing what&#39;s going on yes that&#39;s -</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.190" end="00:45:02.360" style="s2">at the time of the virus but it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.260" end="00:45:03.770" style="s2">all the time they&#39;re all the time very</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.360" end="00:45:06.460" style="s2">interesting yeah that&#39;s the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.770" end="00:45:09.170" style="s2">the second thing is on capability</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.460" end="00:45:10.820" style="s2">there&#39;s real questions here but are we</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.170" end="00:45:12.890" style="s2">up to at night there&#39;s some really good</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.820" end="00:45:15.320" style="s2">stories here about capability because</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.890" end="00:45:17.360" style="s2">with 3d machines and be mobilised to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.320" end="00:45:18.740" style="s2">create new kinds of medical equipment</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.360" end="00:45:21.590" style="s2">that that wouldn&#39;t have been possible a</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.740" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">long time ago there are some signs that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.590" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">vaccination efforts are being</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:27.980" style="s2">accelerated yeah already some evidence</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:29.630" style="s2">about things that we can take to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.980" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">the chance of fatality if you catch it</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.630" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">so as not as of the human species is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:36.290" style="s2">mobilizing the capability response sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.780" style="s2">anyways we are up to this we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.290" end="00:45:41.210" style="s2">planning carefully to flatten the curve</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.780" end="00:45:44.900" style="s2">and reduce impacts and hospitals and all</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.210" end="00:45:47.050" style="s2">that but it begs the question of more</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.900" end="00:45:49.930" style="s2">generally our wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.050" end="00:45:51.370" style="s2">yeah oh yeah we&#39;re not a wisdom yet okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.930" end="00:45:53.950" style="s2">that was one of my questions for you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.370" end="00:45:56.080" style="s2">okay keep if you know my PhD wasn&#39;t with</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.950" end="00:45:58.690" style="s2">them so yeah I&#39;ve come to that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.080" end="00:46:01.870" style="s2">on the context in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.690" end="00:46:04.900" style="s2">virus the capability question is are we</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.870" end="00:46:07.630" style="s2">up to dealing with this in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.900" end="00:46:09.700" style="s2">minimizes harm now that&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.630" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">the medical response it&#39;s also about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.700" end="00:46:14.140" style="s2">social and civic society response yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.270" style="s2">for example enlightened governments from</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.140" end="00:46:18.700" style="s2">now be doing things like giving a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.270" end="00:46:21.220" style="s2">temporary universal basic income to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.700" end="00:46:22.630" style="s2">everyone so that there&#39;s not people are</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.220" end="00:46:23.830" style="s2">not going to work and getting infected</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.630" end="00:46:25.600" style="s2">or going schooling getting infected</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.830" end="00:46:28.300" style="s2">because they have to pay their bills</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.600" end="00:46:30.370" style="s2">right yeah now you need to take that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.300" end="00:46:31.390" style="s2">problem out of the equation so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.370" end="00:46:34.120" style="s2">key the ability question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.390" end="00:46:36.100" style="s2">heightened are we up to it yeah are we</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.120" end="00:46:38.080" style="s2">gonna leave a lot of people behind even</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.100" end="00:46:42.670" style="s2">if we solve the problem you know people</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.080" end="00:46:46.590" style="s2">who can&#39;t afford to pay the bills after</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.670" end="00:46:49.030" style="s2">you know after losing their their job</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.590" end="00:46:50.830" style="s2">that comes for the next bit legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.030" end="00:46:53.860" style="s2">because there are justice questions and</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.830" end="00:46:56.080" style="s2">fairness questions the question of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.860" end="00:46:58.810" style="s2">legitimacy looms large here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.080" end="00:47:02.110" style="s2">about who gets to decide who lives and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.810" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">dies on what basis right so the UK</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.110" end="00:47:09.340" style="s2">government for example appeared to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">a decision that would would put the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.340" end="00:47:13.390" style="s2">elders especially and follow the elders</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">run up in the elderly because mmm the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.390" end="00:47:18.730" style="s2">elders yeah I think we need to talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:20.740" style="s2">about the elders I&#39;m just gonna bracket</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.730" end="00:47:22.540" style="s2">that because they&#39;re not the elderly</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.980" end="00:48:09.890" style="s2">and then finally the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.930" end="00:48:12.530" style="s2">which I&#39;m sure will be the one that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.890" end="00:48:14.510" style="s2">interest you the most yeah there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.530" end="00:48:17.210" style="s2">the direct encounter with death right</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.510" end="00:48:19.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a by the time I use something</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.210" end="00:48:21.500" style="s2">that I learned from a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.400" end="00:48:24.170" style="s2">we need to Roy I forget the precise</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.500" end="00:48:26.329" style="s2">context but you know the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.170" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">can prevent death doesn&#39;t really stack</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.329" end="00:48:32.210" style="s2">up you know at some level we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:34.430" style="s2">altom utley gonna die yeah yes sir are</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.210" end="00:48:37.310" style="s2">in some ways a scandalous open secret</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.430" end="00:48:40.910" style="s2">that you know that we are so utterly</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.310" end="00:48:42.859" style="s2">contingent so dependent on a beating</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.910" end="00:48:47.089" style="s2">beating muscle that could stop beating</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.859" end="00:48:49.670" style="s2">at almost any time so what the virus</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.089" end="00:48:52.940" style="s2">does it again heightens that experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.670" end="00:48:55.099" style="s2">suddenly it&#39;s like hang on I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.940" end="00:48:57.290" style="s2">think my life was a question work but</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.099" end="00:48:59.630" style="s2">the virus says it might be right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.290" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of scandal also a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.630" end="00:49:06.410" style="s2">reckoning and one of the reasons your</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:09.530" style="s2">life is at risk is that the global</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.410" end="00:49:13.940" style="s2">system is so thoroughly interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.530" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">and fragile really fragile even if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.940" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">can show data showing enormous progress</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:20.270" style="s2">on literacy and medical and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:22.069" style="s2">advances and even prosperity and people</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.270" end="00:49:24.260" style="s2">coming out of poverty and young kids</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.069" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">learning to read and African nations</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.260" end="00:49:28.490" style="s2">getting better you can tell an</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:31.160" style="s2">optimistic story of civilization yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.490" end="00:49:33.710" style="s2">that deeper will often obscure the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.160" end="00:49:35.390" style="s2">underlying agility of the system right</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.710" end="00:49:38.890" style="s2">which is about a function of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.390" end="00:49:42.260" style="s2">interdependence and a function of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.890" end="00:49:45.140" style="s2">complex systems only requiring minor</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.140" end="00:49:49.790" style="s2">your facts right and this makes me think</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">of your critique of our critique of</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.790" end="00:49:56.599" style="s2">liberalism which tries to hide death at</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">any cost right yeah and I guess if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.599" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">were if you your wife is Indian people</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">who live in India they burned the corpse</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:08.780" style="s2">you know in the open so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:11.420" style="s2">meditation on death and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.780" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">this virus I was thinking is forcing us</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.420" end="00:50:15.930" style="s2">into a meditation on death</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:17.430" style="s2">way you might like this so when I did</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.930" end="00:50:21.150" style="s2">the spirituality project death was one</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.430" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">of the themes and the pieces research</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.150" end="00:50:25.920" style="s2">that I was most taken by was related to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:29.400" style="s2">a phenomenon known as post-traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.920" end="00:50:30.569" style="s2">growth yeah I mean murdered best right</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.400" end="00:50:32.550" style="s2">post-traumatic stress everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.569" end="00:50:34.619" style="s2">about it&#39;s what military people come</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.550" end="00:50:37.619" style="s2">back with and we have a control monster</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.619" end="00:50:39.270" style="s2">and post-traumatic growth is very</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.619" end="00:50:41.609" style="s2">different than others it&#39;s often people</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.270" end="00:50:43.619" style="s2">who were close to death who may have had</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.609" end="00:50:46.230" style="s2">cancer or may have had an accident</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.619" end="00:50:48.569" style="s2">yeah and they survived it and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.230" end="00:50:50.700" style="s2">they&#39;re like okay what was I doing all</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.569" end="00:50:53.130" style="s2">that time given them a given that I now</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.700" end="00:50:55.859" style="s2">know my life is so fragile I think a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.130" end="00:50:57.660" style="s2">little bit differently and what what the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.859" end="00:51:00.990" style="s2">research shows is those who have</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.660" end="00:51:03.150" style="s2">near-death experiences not so much in</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.990" end="00:51:05.190" style="s2">this spiritual I was looking at my body</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.150" end="00:51:07.770" style="s2">from above way but more the kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.190" end="00:51:10.380" style="s2">almost died and I&#39;m not sure I looked</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.770" end="00:51:12.329" style="s2">like I want to live way yeah if you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.380" end="00:51:15.210" style="s2">that experience what research shows is</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.329" end="00:51:17.400" style="s2">people invariably turn towards a life of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.210" end="00:51:19.619" style="s2">more intrinsic value closer connection</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.400" end="00:51:22.349" style="s2">to nature and loved ones their own</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.619" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">crafts and pursuits much less concerned</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.349" end="00:51:27.420" style="s2">for status much less concerned for</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:30.030" style="s2">achievement and but use the the killer</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.420" end="00:51:32.220" style="s2">you think that I find very curious about</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.030" end="00:51:34.230" style="s2">that it comes about because people</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.220" end="00:51:36.599" style="s2">realize they almost stopped it and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.230" end="00:51:39.420" style="s2">were going to die yeah but they knew</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.599" end="00:51:41.970" style="s2">that already right yeah this is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.420" end="00:51:45.240" style="s2">thing that&#39;s very bizarre is as if the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.970" end="00:51:47.790" style="s2">human being well we know it</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.240" end="00:51:53.010" style="s2">intellectually but we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.790" end="00:51:56.339" style="s2">direct encounter with with with it or or</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.010" end="00:51:59.730" style="s2">are able we&#39;re not able to digest it or</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.339" end="00:52:00.900" style="s2">feel it in a full-on way and once we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.730" end="00:52:03.930" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.900" end="00:52:05.910" style="s2">we wake up you know right so I guess one</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:09.050" style="s2">thing is one way of seeing the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.910" end="00:52:12.329" style="s2">it&#39;s a species wide encounter with our</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.050" end="00:52:16.410" style="s2">individual and shared mortality mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.329" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s uh that could be ultimately a</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.410" end="00:52:19.950" style="s2">positive thing although there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:23.250" style="s2">lot of tragedy and a lot of heartache</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.950" end="00:52:26.130" style="s2">and pain and literal asphyxiation along</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.250" end="00:52:29.099" style="s2">the way so</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.130" end="00:52:32.099" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s dark and it&#39;s a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.099" end="00:52:34.279" style="s2">reckoning it&#39;s also something that may</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.099" end="00:52:37.650" style="s2">pass and be forgotten within six months</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.279" end="00:52:40.200" style="s2">yeah but I don&#39;t sense that at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.650" end="00:52:41.160" style="s2">moment but it&#39;s possible part of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.200" end="00:52:43.380" style="s2">offense making me part of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.160" end="00:52:45.450" style="s2">intelligibility aspect I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.380" end="00:52:48.539" style="s2">earlier is we don&#39;t know how long this</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.450" end="00:52:49.979" style="s2">is gonna last and that&#39;s an unusual</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.539" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">situation we have this feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.979" end="00:52:54.150" style="s2">there is a normal reality we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">back to I think what this shows is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.150" end="00:52:57.660" style="s2">that normal reality was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:59.789" style="s2">fiction yeah the normal reality is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.660" end="00:53:02.489" style="s2">fiction and everything&#39;s going to change</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.789" end="00:53:04.970" style="s2">on some level even if everything appears</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.489" end="00:53:07.259" style="s2">to be somewhat the same it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.970" end="00:53:09.749" style="s2">there has to be some kind of wide</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.259" end="00:53:13.470" style="s2">systemic change after this it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.749" end="00:53:15.569" style="s2">there&#39;s just no question about that well</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.470" end="00:53:17.549" style="s2">well hold on many I&#39;m being too</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.569" end="00:53:21.059" style="s2">optimistic well if we could go back to</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.549" end="00:53:24.359" style="s2">being the same idiots that we were you</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.059" end="00:53:26.450" style="s2">know always but we have immunity to</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.359" end="00:53:30.630" style="s2">change you know Robert Keegan absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.450" end="00:53:33.029" style="s2">this and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised how</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.630" end="00:53:34.650" style="s2">quickly we can hide this under the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.029" end="00:53:38.460" style="s2">carpet as a word and get about a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.650" end="00:53:39.719" style="s2">business but one we have seen this to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.460" end="00:53:43.319" style="s2">bring it back to a more religious</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.719" end="00:53:47.009" style="s2">sensibility if this is a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.319" end="00:53:49.380" style="s2">profound deceitful Abril mm-hmm yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.009" end="00:53:51.989" style="s2">our habit energy and our main patterns</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.380" end="00:53:54.420" style="s2">Society at a societal level or by going</p>

<p begin="00:53:54.420" end="00:53:58.319" style="s2">where we&#39;re not allowed to go through</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.339" end="00:54:02.390" style="s2">the motions we have to change how we</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.319" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">live and think and act and reflect and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.390" end="00:54:09.749" style="s2">what that reminds me of is why Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:11.039" style="s2">used parables right mm-hmm and it seems</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.329" end="00:54:27.390" style="s2">that is not the Jesus studied PHP as</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.569" end="00:54:28.950" style="s2">such but he sort of recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.390" end="00:54:31.170" style="s2">there was something as they recognized</p>

<p begin="00:54:39.480" end="00:54:44.580" style="s2">loaded time or you have the Romans and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.450" end="00:54:47.000" style="s2">you&#39;re the Pharisees and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.580" end="00:54:49.350" style="s2">practices and the ritual purity and</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.000" end="00:54:51.240" style="s2">who&#39;s meant to be a messiah and who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.240" end="00:54:57.810" style="s2">that context and he doesn&#39;t see I am</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.230" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">this and this is why things are</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.810" end="00:55:03.150" style="s2">he tells lots and lots of stories mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:05.130" style="s2">yeah why would he do that right and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.150" end="00:55:06.780" style="s2">claim is at least in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.130" end="00:55:08.430" style="s2">research like in Zen</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.780" end="00:55:10.290" style="s2">they do the same thing they right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.430" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">little bit like the coins right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.290" end="00:55:14.850" style="s2">these crazy deliberately creating new</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">cycle Librium because only in that face</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.850" end="00:55:20.460" style="s2">of disequilibrium can some new</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:22.890" style="s2">understanding emerge some new cell</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.460" end="00:55:25.859" style="s2">emerge some new society emerge right</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.890" end="00:55:28.920" style="s2">good see the viruses are kind of opening</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.859" end="00:55:30.630" style="s2">up that this equilibrium allowing us the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.920" end="00:55:33.750" style="s2">time to reflect and withdraw and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.630" end="00:55:36.780" style="s2">hopefully transform in some way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.750" end="00:55:39.060" style="s2">yeah I imagine oh be both I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.780" end="00:55:41.790" style="s2">some people will go just nuts and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.060" end="00:55:44.520" style="s2">other people will will go you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.790" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">a chance to actually go and retreat like</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.520" end="00:55:49.619" style="s2">seems to me like I don&#39;t know as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:51.600" style="s2">practicing Buddhist for 20 years going</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.619" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">on retreat is something where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.600" end="00:55:56.670" style="s2">actually go deeper into life you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:59.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not an escape from life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.670" end="00:56:03.270" style="s2">actually you go deeper into life and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.030" end="00:56:06.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a chance to do that yeah yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.270" end="00:56:08.130" style="s2">mean I fear people for 70 who did who</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.600" end="00:56:10.590" style="s2">might be relatively lucky in this regard</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.130" end="00:56:11.580" style="s2">I think for others you&#39;ve got cramped</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.590" end="00:56:13.980" style="s2">living quarters</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.580" end="00:56:14.910" style="s2">exactly going up domestic violence you</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.980" end="00:56:18.680" style="s2">have you know there are other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.910" end="00:56:21.240" style="s2">telling the story oh but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.680" end="00:56:23.180" style="s2">certainly in principle it affords that</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.240" end="00:56:26.580" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.180" end="00:56:28.560" style="s2">amongst other things yeah yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.580" end="00:56:31.650" style="s2">you&#39;re right to mention that it could</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.560" end="00:56:33.960" style="s2">just people could retreat into their</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.650" end="00:56:37.080" style="s2">hell all right whereas they might have</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.960" end="00:56:40.940" style="s2">had a way out before yeah so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.080" end="00:56:40.940" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s both things</p>
