<p begin="00:00:38.400" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">people why is everyone just outside</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:44.579" style="s2">waiting in a line and it&#39;s confusing you</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">think maybe there&#39;s a celebrity there</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.530" end="00:01:15.510" style="s2">Peterson that it just attracts such a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.020" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">large audience and for me personally</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.510" end="00:01:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s how genuine he is when he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:22.230" style="s2">many times you&#39;ll see him get on stage</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">is it&#39;s so eloquent and yet so simple to</p>

<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:36.930" style="s2">nowadays it&#39;s really amazing to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">Professor Peterson here because he was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:41.180" style="s2">the initial inspiration behind students</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:48.919" style="s2">in support of free speech</p>

<p begin="00:01:54.520" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">on that note it is my pleasure to</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:31.220" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to talk to you a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.610" end="00:02:35.180" style="s2">briefly about why post-modernism is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.220" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">wrong and I actually mean technically</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.180" end="00:02:38.210" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:39.740" style="s2">apart from ethically wrong and morally</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.210" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">wrong and intellectually wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.740" end="00:02:46.460" style="s2">emotionally wrong and practically wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:48.170" style="s2">but I&#39;ll give it a devil is due to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.460" end="00:02:50.150" style="s2">with because they&#39;re actually wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.170" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">with quite a difficult problem and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.150" end="00:02:55.610" style="s2">founders of post-modernism were by no</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:57.650" style="s2">means unintelligent individuals and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.610" end="00:02:59.660" style="s2">actually put your finger on quite an</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.650" end="00:03:01.070" style="s2">important problem and the important</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.660" end="00:03:04.850" style="s2">problem that they put their finger on</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.070" end="00:03:07.010" style="s2">was the fact that any set of phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.850" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">has a near infinite number of potential</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.010" end="00:03:14.390" style="s2">interpretations and that actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:16.850" style="s2">happens to be the case that that fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.390" end="00:03:19.610" style="s2">let&#39;s say was discovered simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.850" end="00:03:21.110" style="s2">in a number of different disciplines one</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.610" end="00:03:22.310" style="s2">of them most surprising it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.110" end="00:03:24.140" style="s2">artificial intelligence and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.310" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">artificial intelligence people ran into</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.140" end="00:03:27.260" style="s2">that conundrum when they learned that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:28.790" style="s2">was much more difficult to make a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.260" end="00:03:30.770" style="s2">machine that could perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.790" end="00:03:31.970" style="s2">that had originally been supposed you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.770" end="00:03:34.280" style="s2">know we&#39;re supposed to have autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.970" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">robots and or and functional artificial</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.280" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">intelligence backed by the late 60s and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">of course that didn&#39;t happen and part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:41.810" style="s2">the reason for that was that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:43.000" style="s2">artificial intelligence researchers when</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.810" end="00:03:45.560" style="s2">they were starting to instantiate</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.000" end="00:03:47.930" style="s2">perception into their machines learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.560" end="00:03:50.990" style="s2">that charting your course in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.930" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">might be a trivial problem in comparison</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.990" end="00:03:54.770" style="s2">to determining how to perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:56.600" style="s2">and the reason for that is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.770" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">a very large number of ways to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.600" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">the world and the postmodernist actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.630" style="s2">caught on to this and one of the claims</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.250" style="s2">they made was that well there&#39;s a near</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.630" end="00:04:06.590" style="s2">infinite number of ways to interpret any</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.250" end="00:04:08.600" style="s2">given text and that actually also</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.590" end="00:04:10.130" style="s2">happens to be the case and then they</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.600" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">said well since there&#39;s a near infinite</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.130" end="00:04:13.010" style="s2">number of ways to interpret any text how</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.080" end="00:04:15.110" style="s2">do you know that any given</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.010" end="00:04:16.460" style="s2">interpretation should should take</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.110" end="00:04:18.230" style="s2">precedence over any other interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.460" end="00:04:21.200" style="s2">which is also a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.230" end="00:04:23.720" style="s2">issue they went off the rails very</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.200" end="00:04:25.430" style="s2">rapidly after putting forward that set</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.720" end="00:04:27.410" style="s2">of propositions and that&#39;s partly why</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.430" end="00:04:28.970" style="s2">they also kept their alliance with</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.410" end="00:04:30.950" style="s2">Marxism because the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.970" end="00:04:32.030" style="s2">post-modernism fundamentally is that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.950" end="00:04:33.770" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.030" end="00:04:35.750" style="s2">agree to the proposition that all</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.770" end="00:04:37.610" style="s2">interpretations of all phenomena are of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.750" end="00:04:39.410" style="s2">equal value or lack of value then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.610" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">can&#39;t act in the world and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.410" end="00:04:42.350" style="s2">with that is that if your human being</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2">you have to act in the world because</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.350" end="00:04:48.050" style="s2">otherwise you you you suffer miserably</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">and then you die and that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.050" end="00:04:52.520" style="s2">that seems to be an unacceptable outcome</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:54.250" style="s2">for most people so the issue with</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.520" end="00:04:56.600" style="s2">post-modernism isn&#39;t so much the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.250" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">erroneous claim that there are a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.600" end="00:04:59.960" style="s2">large number of interpretations for any</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:02.690" style="s2">given phenomena including the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.960" end="00:05:04.850" style="s2">a text the error in post-modernism is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.690" end="00:05:06.620" style="s2">the failure to recognize that there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.850" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">a finite number of credible</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.620" end="00:05:11.960" style="s2">interpretations of phenomena and also a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:13.490" style="s2">refusal to engage with the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.960" end="00:05:15.740" style="s2">problem that determining what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">finite set might actually consist of and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">I&#39;ll just give you a very brief overview</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:21.770" style="s2">of how it is that we happen to solve</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:24.290" style="s2">this problem as human beings we do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.770" end="00:05:25.910" style="s2">partly biologically because we inhabit a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.290" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">biological framework that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.910" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">developed over the course of about 3.5</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:32.300" style="s2">million years that severely constrains</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:35.060" style="s2">the manner in which we interpret the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.300" end="00:05:37.880" style="s2">world and it constrains it such that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.060" end="00:05:39.650" style="s2">tend to only manifest spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.880" end="00:05:41.810" style="s2">manifest interpretations of the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.650" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">that don&#39;t result in undue suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.810" end="00:05:46.040" style="s2">our demise and there&#39;s plenty of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">be stupid enough to perish and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.040" end="00:05:49.790" style="s2">plenty of ways to be stupid enough to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:51.590" style="s2">suffer without meaning but there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.790" end="00:05:53.479" style="s2">very many ways to live properly and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.590" end="00:05:55.460" style="s2">carefully for a long period of time in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.479" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">manner that doesn&#39;t also simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.460" end="00:05:59.419" style="s2">do harm to other people and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:01.160" style="s2">the second set of constraints is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.419" end="00:06:02.540" style="s2">you have biological constraints on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.160" end="00:06:04.520" style="s2">perception than they&#39;re built in as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.540" end="00:06:06.740" style="s2">consequence of a Darwinian process and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.520" end="00:06:09.890" style="s2">the second part is that you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.740" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">forced to interact with yourself now in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.890" end="00:06:14.090" style="s2">this week next week and the week after</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:15.770" style="s2">and the month after in the year after so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.090" end="00:06:18.050" style="s2">you have to conduct yourself in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.770" end="00:06:19.510" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t interfere with your future</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.050" end="00:06:21.260" style="s2">life as you&#39;re living now and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.510" end="00:06:23.180" style="s2">simultaneously you have to conduct</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.260" end="00:06:24.530" style="s2">yourself in a way that makes all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.180" end="00:06:26.540" style="s2">other people around you want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.530" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2">cooperate with you and compete with you</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.540" end="00:06:31.130" style="s2">and maintain the relationship with you</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.339" end="00:12:08.879" style="s2">generally speaking started to look into</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.170" end="00:12:10.680" style="s2">the claims that I was making about such</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.879" end="00:12:13.050" style="s2">things as the legislative policies</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.680" end="00:12:14.610" style="s2">surrounding Bill c16 they realized that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.050" end="00:12:16.529" style="s2">I was actually just reading what was</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.610" end="00:12:18.899" style="s2">written on the page and understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.529" end="00:12:20.850" style="s2">instead of trying to blow something out</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.899" end="00:12:23.579" style="s2">of proportion which I had absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.850" end="00:12:27.689" style="s2">motivation whatsoever to do but then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.579" end="00:12:29.100" style="s2">know I thought I thought no you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.689" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">have political interference with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.100" end="00:12:33.389" style="s2">universities because what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:35.160" style="s2">that you know you think what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.389" end="00:12:36.930" style="s2">that if you arm the politicians so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.160" end="00:12:38.730" style="s2">they can start telling the universities</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.930" end="00:12:40.559" style="s2">what they can and cannot teach even with</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.730" end="00:12:42.779" style="s2">regards to funding is then that goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.559" end="00:12:44.129" style="s2">seriously sideways very rapidly and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.779" end="00:12:45.750" style="s2">don&#39;t end up with the result that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.129" end="00:12:47.850" style="s2">wanted you end up with some other result</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.750" end="00:12:50.279" style="s2">because you know how it is when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.850" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">allow one organization to interfere with</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.389" end="00:13:04.529" style="s2">not a good idea so I think I have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.250" end="00:13:07.110" style="s2">better idea and I think the better idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.529" end="00:13:10.889" style="s2">is that the post modernist should be</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.110" end="00:13:12.809" style="s2">starved at their source and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.889" end="00:13:14.360" style="s2">use that terminology lightly I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.809" end="00:13:16.290" style="s2">that what needs to happen is that</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.290" end="00:13:20.699" style="s2">students and and students coming into</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.520" end="00:13:39.510" style="s2">as a half confused highschool student</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.710" end="00:14:08.730" style="s2">over time and the humanities have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.600" end="00:14:10.410" style="s2">being decimated since the 1960s as a</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.450" end="00:14:17.880" style="s2">something cool that happened this week I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.190" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">think I decided a couple of weeks ago to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.880" end="00:14:23.010" style="s2">make a postmodern lexicon and I started</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:25.110" style="s2">analyzing word use in I was gathering</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.010" end="00:14:26.970" style="s2">abstracts from this Twitter site called</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.110" end="00:14:29.630" style="s2">new real peer-review which is something</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.970" end="00:14:31.650" style="s2">that the post modernists really hate and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.630" end="00:14:33.660" style="s2">because of course what new real</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.650" end="00:14:36.690" style="s2">peer-reviewed does is take actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.660" end="00:14:38.940" style="s2">published abstracts from postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.690" end="00:14:41.550" style="s2">humanities journals which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.940" end="00:14:44.850" style="s2">have a zero citation rate of 80% and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.550" end="00:14:47.450" style="s2">merely and merely republish them and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.850" end="00:14:49.950" style="s2">abstracts are so reprehensible and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.450" end="00:14:53.130" style="s2">incoherent and so cult-like</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.950" end="00:14:54.840" style="s2">and ideologically addled that the people</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.130" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">who wrote them get irritated when other</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.840" end="00:15:00.330" style="s2">people read them and which is which is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:02.010" style="s2">good because the original the real</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.330" end="00:15:03.960" style="s2">peer-review which was the first one was</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.010" end="00:15:05.880" style="s2">shut down by people who are irritated</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.960" end="00:15:07.890" style="s2">that the people who ran the Twitter site</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.880" end="00:15:11.160" style="s2">had the unmitigated gall to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.890" end="00:15:13.650" style="s2">publicized writing that was written to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.160" end="00:15:15.540" style="s2">be publicized it was like the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.650" end="00:15:17.190" style="s2">situation I&#39;ve ever seen where authors</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.540" end="00:15:18.840" style="s2">were actually embarrassed that someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.190" end="00:15:20.970" style="s2">did what they could to publicize what</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.840" end="00:15:22.680" style="s2">they&#39;d written anyways new real peer</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.970" end="00:15:24.360" style="s2">review picked up where they stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.680" end="00:15:26.580" style="s2">has been publishing abstracts like mad</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.360" end="00:15:29.190" style="s2">from these crazy postmodern journals</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.580" end="00:15:31.830" style="s2">which are journals only in name and so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.190" end="00:15:32.940" style="s2">started to pull out key keywords well</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.830" end="00:15:35.370" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.940" end="00:15:37.320" style="s2">game in a minute I started to pull out</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.370" end="00:15:39.420" style="s2">keywords that were emblematic of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.320" end="00:15:41.130" style="s2">call it the postmodern cult and then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.420" end="00:15:41.740" style="s2">thought I generated questionnaire that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.130" end="00:15:44.110" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.740" end="00:15:46.210" style="s2">parents of university students and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.110" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">late-stage high school students and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.210" end="00:15:50.050" style="s2">freshmen and university and maybe second</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:51.370" style="s2">year students could use as a guideline</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.050" end="00:15:53.500" style="s2">so they could look at the course</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.370" end="00:15:55.870" style="s2">descriptions and check off word</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.500" end="00:15:58.090" style="s2">frequency from the post-modern list and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.870" end="00:15:59.410" style="s2">decide that if the course was part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.090" end="00:16:01.900" style="s2">the postmodern cult that they should</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.410" end="00:16:04.540" style="s2">maybe just not take it but then I got a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.900" end="00:16:06.220" style="s2">real interesting email from a guy I will</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.540" end="00:16:07.660" style="s2">tell you his name yet but who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.220" end="00:16:10.150" style="s2">computer programmer and he put together</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.660" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">an AI system to parse apart post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.150" end="00:16:13.990" style="s2">the post modern lexicon automatically</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.430" end="00:16:16.120" style="s2">and he set up a website now where</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.990" end="00:16:19.180" style="s2">students can feed in course descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.120" end="00:16:23.280" style="s2">of any sort and it will spit out whether</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.180" end="00:16:23.280" style="s2">or not they&#39;re postmodern and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.160" end="00:16:34.350" style="s2">and so we&#39;re developing so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:35.610" style="s2">to get the to get the program up to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.350" end="00:16:37.500" style="s2">point where it can automatically</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.610" end="00:16:39.690" style="s2">distinguish between postmodern and non</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.500" end="00:16:41.520" style="s2">postmodern content and then students</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.690" end="00:16:43.830" style="s2">will be able to cut and paste a course</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.520" end="00:16:45.690" style="s2">description and paste it into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.830" end="00:16:47.610" style="s2">analysis box on this website along with</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.690" end="00:16:49.320" style="s2">the professor&#39;s name and the courses</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.610" end="00:16:51.420" style="s2">name and the discipline and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.320" end="00:16:53.940" style="s2">university and so we should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.420" end="00:16:55.470" style="s2">produce a listing of every University in</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.940" end="00:16:57.780" style="s2">every course that people are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.470" end="00:16:59.700" style="s2">participate in analyzing across North</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.780" end="00:17:01.290" style="s2">America and set up a list of courses and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.700" end="00:17:04.020" style="s2">professors and disciplines that should</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.290" end="00:17:05.339" style="s2">be avoided and and so maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.020" end="00:17:08.120" style="s2">starve them out at their source and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.339" end="00:17:08.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what should happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.230" end="00:17:18.550" style="s2">so it has it has to be bottom up as far</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.990" end="00:17:20.530" style="s2">as I can tell for this to come to an end</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.550" end="00:17:22.390" style="s2">and it should come to an end because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.530" end="00:17:24.280" style="s2">post-modern neo-marxist doctrine is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.390" end="00:17:25.420" style="s2">nothing but a cult except that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.280" end="00:17:27.190" style="s2">sort of cult that doesn&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.420" end="00:17:30.100" style="s2">economic sense to run itself out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.190" end="00:17:31.900" style="s2">profit so not only is it a cult it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.100" end="00:17:33.640" style="s2">failed cult and if it was so it&#39;s a cult</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.900" end="00:17:35.470" style="s2">that has to be subsidized by the public</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.640" end="00:17:36.670" style="s2">person in order to exist at all so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.470" end="00:17:38.620" style="s2">that&#39;s like that&#39;s a pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.670" end="00:17:40.030" style="s2">pathetic cult because normally if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.620" end="00:17:41.770" style="s2">a decent cult leader you can least</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.030" end="00:17:43.540" style="s2">figure out a way to pick the pockets of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.770" end="00:17:47.080" style="s2">your of your victims in a manner that</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.080" end="00:17:50.410" style="s2">get that right which I think it counts</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.490" end="00:17:51.570" style="s2">for the pronounced anti-capitalist bias</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.410" end="00:17:53.830" style="s2">because they haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.570" end="00:17:54.910" style="s2">transform their ideological doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.830" end="00:17:57.880" style="s2">into some way of making themselves</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.880" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">seems to have done a great job of</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:04.540" style="s2">of student loans in the United States</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.590" end="00:18:08.950" style="s2">entrepreneurial decisions and take some</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.240" end="00:18:10.780" style="s2">risks which is also something that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.950" end="00:18:12.910" style="s2">regard is absolutely reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.780" end="00:18:14.920" style="s2">so universities have figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.910" end="00:18:16.690" style="s2">conspire in some sense to pick the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.920" end="00:18:19.750" style="s2">future pockets of the students that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.690" end="00:18:20.860" style="s2">they&#39;re purporting to to educate and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.750" end="00:18:22.330" style="s2">they&#39;re not educating them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.860" end="00:18:23.710" style="s2">indoctrinating them they&#39;re not teaching</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:33.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s an absolutely appalling</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.140" end="00:18:34.690" style="s2">because that&#39;s what the bloody</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.040" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">institution was there for to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.690" end="00:18:36.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to be</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.200" end="00:18:52.340" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.010" end="00:18:59.930" style="s2">yeah so what else do I have to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.340" end="00:19:01.610" style="s2">about that oh yes I just have one more</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.930" end="00:19:03.530" style="s2">thing I guess that one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.610" end="00:19:06.710" style="s2">that I&#39;m quite was quite curious about</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.530" end="00:19:08.120" style="s2">was um I&#39;ll tell you about two things</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.710" end="00:19:11.090" style="s2">one of the things I was quite curious</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.120" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">about is the post-modern say neo-marxist</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.090" end="00:19:15.080" style="s2">insistence that the only true human</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:16.550" style="s2">motivation is power now I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.080" end="00:19:18.560" style="s2">thinking about that in a couple of ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.550" end="00:19:20.570" style="s2">I think that was actually Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.560" end="00:19:21.950" style="s2">sleight of hand at the end of the 1960&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.570" end="00:19:25.790" style="s2">because the original Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.950" end="00:19:27.920" style="s2">revolutionary doctrine was that Western</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.790" end="00:19:29.690" style="s2">society let&#39;s say capitalist society but</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.920" end="00:19:31.460" style="s2">you can think about it more broadly as</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.690" end="00:19:35.030" style="s2">society in general it&#39;s basically best</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.460" end="00:19:37.550" style="s2">conceptualized as a zero-sum zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.030" end="00:19:39.230" style="s2">game fought to the death between the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.550" end="00:19:41.090" style="s2">oppressors and the oppressed and be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.230" end="00:19:43.310" style="s2">proletariat and the Barozzi let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.090" end="00:19:45.170" style="s2">and you know as we as we know playing</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.310" end="00:19:46.730" style="s2">that game in places like Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.170" end="00:19:48.260" style="s2">and Mao&#39;s China didn&#39;t work out so well</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.730" end="00:19:49.310" style="s2">for everyone so there seemed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.260" end="00:19:51.020" style="s2">fundamental flaw in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.310" end="00:19:52.670" style="s2">conceptualization although people could</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.020" end="00:19:54.860" style="s2">always excuse that by saying well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.670" end="00:19:56.090" style="s2">not real communism which is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.860" end="00:19:57.650" style="s2">statement that should immediately get</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.090" end="00:20:01.180" style="s2">you punched in the nose hard enough to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.650" end="00:20:01.180" style="s2">knock you out as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.540" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">so because the statement like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.560" end="00:20:09.590" style="s2">reveals only one thing and what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:11.180" style="s2">reveals is that if you had been</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.590" end="00:20:12.920" style="s2">fortunate enough to be in the position</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.180" end="00:20:14.060" style="s2">of position of Joseph&#39;s tellement you</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.920" end="00:20:15.830" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been quite the murderous</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.060" end="00:20:17.690" style="s2">monster that he was because your moral</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.830" end="00:20:19.640" style="s2">character is such so that you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.690" end="00:20:21.740" style="s2">be swayed by access to that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.640" end="00:20:23.030" style="s2">extreme power and if you&#39;re if you dare</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.740" end="00:20:24.680" style="s2">to make that claim then there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.030" end="00:20:25.730" style="s2">things about yourself in humanity that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.680" end="00:20:27.560" style="s2">you should learn and you should learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.730" end="00:20:29.270" style="s2">them rapidly before you pose more of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.560" end="00:20:33.590" style="s2">danger to yourself and others than you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.270" end="00:20:36.050" style="s2">already pose so so then so part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.590" end="00:20:38.360" style="s2">the post modernists turned the marxist</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.050" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">emphasis on economics into an emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.360" end="00:20:42.260" style="s2">on power in the 1970s and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">did that as a form of sleight of hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.260" end="00:20:46.900" style="s2">because by the late 1960s and early</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:49.490" style="s2">1970s it was obvious even to people as</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.900" end="00:20:51.590" style="s2">intransigent as someone as say jean-paul</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.490" end="00:20:53.450" style="s2">Sartre which who refused to denounce the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.590" end="00:20:55.610" style="s2">Communist Party until that late and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.450" end="00:20:57.170" style="s2">that progression of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.610" end="00:20:58.820" style="s2">it became obvious even to people like</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.170" end="00:21:00.380" style="s2">that that there was just no way that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.820" end="00:21:02.630" style="s2">could maintain your intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.380" end="00:21:05.390" style="s2">moral credibility and remain a supporter</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.630" end="00:21:07.460" style="s2">of standard communist doctrine and also</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.390" end="00:21:09.110" style="s2">it seemed to be the case that strangely</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.460" end="00:21:10.490" style="s2">enough contrary to Marx&#39;s prediction</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.110" end="00:21:12.410" style="s2">that the working class in the West was</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:13.910" style="s2">getting richer and richer than people</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.410" end="00:21:15.650" style="s2">had ever got in history rather than</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.910" end="00:21:18.260" style="s2">being increasingly downtrodden by the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.650" end="00:21:20.150" style="s2">brute heel of the of the corporate and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.260" end="00:21:22.100" style="s2">capitalist elite so it was not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.150" end="00:21:24.770" style="s2">revolution that was particularly easy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.100" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">sell part of the site at hand was oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.770" end="00:21:29.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not about economic power</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:30.860" style="s2">it&#39;s about oppression and oppressed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.180" end="00:21:32.510" style="s2">oppressors on a broader sense and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.860" end="00:21:34.580" style="s2">where we got the transformation into</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.510" end="00:21:37.160" style="s2">identity politics which is just the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.580" end="00:21:38.660" style="s2">Marxist oppressor oppressed doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.160" end="00:21:41.270" style="s2">under a new guise and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.660" end="00:21:43.790" style="s2">really tremendously reprehensible for</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.270" end="00:21:46.010" style="s2">people to to be conducting themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.790" end="00:21:49.070" style="s2">intellectually in a manner that insists</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:51.320" style="s2">that the most important element of any</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.070" end="00:21:54.200" style="s2">student or any person for that matter is</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.320" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">whatever racial gender and sex identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.200" end="00:21:57.290" style="s2">happens to be flavor of the month and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:21:59.900" style="s2">think the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.290" end="00:22:01.340" style="s2">fundamentally is first of all that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.900" end="00:22:02.680" style="s2">those category systems are</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.340" end="00:22:04.910" style="s2">extraordinarily loose and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.680" end="00:22:06.980" style="s2">indefinitely multipliable you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.910" end="00:22:08.210" style="s2">because to take any given individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.980" end="00:22:10.730" style="s2">there&#39;s probably well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.210" end="00:22:12.020" style="s2">postmodern problem there we go it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.730" end="00:22:13.850" style="s2">postmodern problem that there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.020" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">an infinite number of ways to categories</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.850" end="00:22:16.790" style="s2">any given individuals so how the hell do</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:18.650" style="s2">you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.790" end="00:22:20.330" style="s2">which group they belong to and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.650" end="00:22:22.310" style="s2">actually a major problem like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.330" end="00:22:24.980" style="s2">1/8 black what does that make you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.310" end="00:22:27.050" style="s2">exactly are you black are you white are</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.980" end="00:22:30.410" style="s2">you oppressed are you oppressor are you</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.050" end="00:22:32.450" style="s2">are you let&#39;s see one half is oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.410" end="00:22:34.220" style="s2">as someone who&#39;s a quarter black does it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.450" end="00:22:36.680" style="s2">work out or is medically that way okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.220" end="00:22:38.120" style="s2">I&#39;m dead serious about this man if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.680" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">going to play this sort of game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.120" end="00:22:41.870" style="s2">exactly the question that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:43.430" style="s2">asked right and then how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.870" end="00:22:45.140" style="s2">you multiply up your oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.430" end="00:22:46.790" style="s2">identities and then again who decides</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.140" end="00:22:48.560" style="s2">who gets to decide exactly which</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.790" end="00:22:50.210" style="s2">identity you should manifest and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.560" end="00:22:52.130" style="s2">how do we rank order those identities</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.210" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">and then how do we equate between them</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.130" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">and what measurement techniques do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:57.530" style="s2">use to determine who&#39;s who&#39;s oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">and who isn&#39;t and how do we assess</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.530" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">equality and on what dimensions are we</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:02.420" style="s2">going to assess equality and who&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.040" end="00:23:04.190" style="s2">to enforce it and who&#39;s going to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.420" end="00:23:05.750" style="s2">the decisions it&#39;s like oh well we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.190" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">figure that out as we go along it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.750" end="00:23:09.140" style="s2">yeah we certainly will and the results</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.590" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2">taking the courses is to know that these</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:18.700" style="s2">are aiming at so that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.360" end="00:26:20.679" style="s2">explained then they need to know what</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.679" end="00:26:25.029" style="s2">courses are using in order to fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.929" end="00:26:27.999" style="s2">those aims then they need to know how to</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.640" end="00:29:20.760" style="s2">of the most shocking things I learned</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.140" end="00:29:22.110" style="s2">this years I didn&#39;t really know this but</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.760" end="00:29:23.460" style="s2">I didn&#39;t learn this till I went to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.110" end="00:29:24.930" style="s2">Queen&#39;s University because I went to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.460" end="00:29:26.760" style="s2">Queen&#39;s University I was invited there</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.930" end="00:29:29.130" style="s2">by a group of law students you know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.760" end="00:29:32.040" style="s2">I was their hope hypothetically to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.130" end="00:29:33.570" style="s2">debate bill c16 and the students went to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.040" end="00:29:34.740" style="s2">all the law professors and asked them if</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.570" end="00:29:37.560" style="s2">they would debate me and none of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.740" end="00:29:39.270" style="s2">would and I thought well I thought yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.560" end="00:29:42.600" style="s2">well that&#39;s figures first of all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.270" end="00:29:43.890" style="s2">what I thought because well but but then</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.600" end="00:29:45.630" style="s2">I thought jeez that&#39;s pretty absurd</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.890" end="00:29:47.400" style="s2">because I&#39;m a psychology professor no</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.630" end="00:29:48.780" style="s2">lawyers one thing lawyers are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.400" end="00:29:51.300" style="s2">good at is arguing if they&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.780" end="00:29:52.590" style="s2">lawyers I mean that in a complementary</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.300" end="00:29:53.970" style="s2">manner I mean that&#39;s what you learn to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.590" end="00:29:55.950" style="s2">do when you&#39;re a lawyer you learn to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.970" end="00:29:58.800" style="s2">speak you learn to formulate an argument</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.950" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">and you learn to form a I&#39;m formulate an</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.800" end="00:30:02.670" style="s2">argument on virtually any set of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:04.740" style="s2">principles because you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.670" end="00:30:06.570" style="s2">acting as defense or you&#39;re acting as</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.740" end="00:30:07.980" style="s2">prosecution and you need to be flexible</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.570" end="00:30:10.470" style="s2">on your feet and put forward the best</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.980" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">possible argument given the facts at</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.470" end="00:30:13.830" style="s2">hand and they couldn&#39;t find anybody to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:15.540" style="s2">debate me so Bruce party who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.830" end="00:30:17.610" style="s2">professor there had act as devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.540" end="00:30:19.500" style="s2">advocate which he did quite nicely but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.610" end="00:30:21.300" style="s2">thought that was pretty pretty appalling</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.500" end="00:30:23.670" style="s2">to say the least that they were either</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.300" end="00:30:25.800" style="s2">so ideological II rigid that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.670" end="00:30:28.890" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t confront me on my on their</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.800" end="00:30:32.160" style="s2">bloody territory it&#39;s like if if he if a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.890" end="00:30:33.810" style="s2">law professor from Queens wanted to come</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.160" end="00:30:35.160" style="s2">and debate me about psychology hey</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.810" end="00:30:37.290" style="s2">there&#39;d be no problem with that because</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.160" end="00:30:39.030" style="s2">that after all is my field of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.290" end="00:30:40.860" style="s2">and the fact that a law professor</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.030" end="00:30:43.260" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t come forward and debate me on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.860" end="00:30:45.060" style="s2">legal matter I thought was just I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.260" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">even know what to think about that but</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.060" end="00:30:48.090" style="s2">one of the things I did learn and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:50.100" style="s2">really learned this more is that law has</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.090" end="00:30:52.260" style="s2">actually become corrupt as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.100" end="00:30:53.580" style="s2">discipline and it&#39;s not so much I know a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.260" end="00:30:55.020" style="s2">lot of lawyers and I&#39;ve worked with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.580" end="00:30:56.820" style="s2">lot but most of them have been more on</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.020" end="00:30:59.250" style="s2">the corporate business end of things and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.820" end="00:31:02.010" style="s2">so but all the human rights law all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.250" end="00:31:03.630" style="s2">law that doesn&#39;t seem to be attached in</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.010" end="00:31:05.340" style="s2">some sense to business concerns has also</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.630" end="00:31:07.890" style="s2">become corrupt and social justice</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.340" end="00:31:09.390" style="s2">oriented beyond belief and the students</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.890" end="00:31:10.920" style="s2">at Queen&#39;s were complaining to me that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.390" end="00:31:12.120" style="s2">they weren&#39;t learning any law in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.920" end="00:31:14.160" style="s2">courses all they were learning with</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.120" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">social justice propaganda so you bloody</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.160" end="00:31:16.770" style="s2">well better watch out for that I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:18.540" style="s2">tell you because the people who make</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.770" end="00:31:20.250" style="s2">your legislation or lawyers and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.540" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">making plenty of legislation that is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.250" end="00:31:24.570" style="s2">in your best interest and even worse</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">than that perhaps it&#39;s not even in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.570" end="00:31:28.909" style="s2">best interest of the people for whom the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:30.830" style="s2">legislation purports to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.909" end="00:31:33.379" style="s2">because the bloody legislation and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.830" end="00:31:35.570" style="s2">policies are so incoherent and so badly</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.379" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">written like bill c16 here&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.570" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">things it did no one knows this and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:40.729" style="s2">can&#39;t believe they haven&#39;t noticed you</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:42.440" style="s2">know the strongest argument that gay</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.729" end="00:31:44.570" style="s2">people have had for the last 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.440" end="00:31:46.700" style="s2">for being included in broader society</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.570" end="00:31:48.950" style="s2">and let&#39;s say tolerated so to speak or</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.700" end="00:31:51.109" style="s2">welcomed for that matter is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.950" end="00:31:52.190" style="s2">a biological phenomenon you know and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.109" end="00:31:53.899" style="s2">say the evidence for that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.190" end="00:31:56.509" style="s2">overwhelming but it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.899" end="00:31:57.950" style="s2">suggestive it&#39;s like Bill c16 has</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.509" end="00:32:00.229" style="s2">eradicated that because it&#39;s predicated</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.950" end="00:32:01.849" style="s2">on the presupposition that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.229" end="00:32:04.099" style="s2">relationship that the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.849" end="00:32:06.349" style="s2">between biological sex gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.099" end="00:32:08.179" style="s2">gender expression and sexual proclivity</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.349" end="00:32:09.799" style="s2">is independent they blew out the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.179" end="00:32:11.720" style="s2">structure that enabled them to make the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.799" end="00:32:13.429" style="s2">argument for including the ruin for</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.720" end="00:32:15.499" style="s2">pursuing the rights to begin with and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.429" end="00:32:17.899" style="s2">if I was a good hateful right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.499" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">radical and feeling rather anti-gay in</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.899" end="00:32:22.070" style="s2">my orientation let&#39;s say I might say</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.970" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">something like oh I see it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.070" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">something you learned is it well how</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:27.619" style="s2">about you unlearn it and if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:29.179" style="s2">your whim well then why should I put up</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.619" end="00:32:32.169" style="s2">with it at all and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.179" end="00:32:34.549" style="s2">written into the damn legislation now so</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.169" end="00:32:36.289" style="s2">so watch the lawyers because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.549" end="00:32:38.149" style="s2">being trained as social justice warriors</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.289" end="00:32:39.559" style="s2">and they&#39;re producing incoherent bits of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.149" end="00:32:41.389" style="s2">legislation that are going to produce a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.559" end="00:32:43.820" style="s2">tremendous amount of problems as they</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.389" end="00:32:48.429" style="s2">roll through the legal system so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.820" end="00:32:48.429" style="s2">in closing the closing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.690" end="00:32:58.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a war of ideas and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.070" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">educational problem and what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.750" end="00:33:02.650" style="s2">to try to do is to educate students well</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:04.510" style="s2">enough well they&#39;re making their course</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.650" end="00:33:06.100" style="s2">decisions so that they can stop being</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.510" end="00:33:07.450" style="s2">indoctrinated by people who should have</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.100" end="00:33:09.100" style="s2">known better than to do that to begin</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.450" end="00:33:10.510" style="s2">with and so that&#39;s the plan for the next</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.100" end="00:33:12.570" style="s2">couple of years and hopefully it will be</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.510" end="00:33:16.830" style="s2">effective so thank you very</p>
