<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:41.550" style="s2">the Q and a stream where we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:44.820" style="s2">attempt to answer all of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">that you all have submitted during the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.820" end="00:04:48.990" style="s2">livestream portion they&#39;re awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">though there are a lot we will do our</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:55.260" style="s2">best try to get through all right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">should we start at the top start at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.260" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">top okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.490" end="00:05:05.850" style="s2">is it raisins yeah Glasgow okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:07.740" style="s2">so evening guys hope you&#39;re well how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.850" end="00:05:09.979" style="s2">you think society and politics will</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.740" end="00:05:13.620" style="s2">change following the pandemics decline</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.979" end="00:05:16.860" style="s2">let me just say I hope that this will</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.620" end="00:05:19.650" style="s2">change us absolutely radically and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.860" end="00:05:22.169" style="s2">fondest hope would be that this wakes us</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.650" end="00:05:24.840" style="s2">up to all sorts of things and that as</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.169" end="00:05:28.050" style="s2">bad as this was it will actually leave</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.840" end="00:05:31.200" style="s2">us ahead in the end because we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.050" end="00:05:34.139" style="s2">trial run at something that could have</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:37.700" style="s2">been far worse and unfolded far faster</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.139" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">so anyway there&#39;s no guarantee that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.700" end="00:05:43.740" style="s2">things will not get vastly worse as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:45.690" style="s2">result of political bumbling and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.740" end="00:05:46.979" style="s2">unexpected but nonetheless it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.690" end="00:05:48.539" style="s2">possible we come out of this ahead</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.979" end="00:05:51.419" style="s2">because we will have learned a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.539" end="00:05:53.250" style="s2">lesson yeah we can hope we sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.419" end="00:05:55.650" style="s2">governments across the world reverting</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:57.419" style="s2">to the mean you know Hungary&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.650" end="00:06:00.060" style="s2">authoritarian for instance so that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.419" end="00:06:03.090" style="s2">not hopeful but we can we can hope that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.060" end="00:06:05.070" style="s2">it will do the opposite what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.090" end="00:06:06.620" style="s2">necessary what is necessary to test for</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.070" end="00:06:08.570" style="s2">viruses we&#39;re on the bottle can we</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.620" end="00:06:09.979" style="s2">body can be sample but materials</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.570" end="00:06:11.060" style="s2">equipment etc what innovations in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.979" end="00:06:15.139" style="s2">testing are possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.060" end="00:06:17.960" style="s2">can you DIY it we spoke to tests a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.139" end="00:06:19.699" style="s2">in our first live stream it&#39;s not our</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.960" end="00:06:21.139" style="s2">wheelhouse all the particulars and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.699" end="00:06:24.590" style="s2">are a variety of different types of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.139" end="00:06:26.780" style="s2">tests and as far as I know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.590" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">possibility of DIY and the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.780" end="00:06:31.669" style="s2">tests I&#39;d only we could DIY the creation</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">of tests the antibody tests could</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.669" end="00:06:36.440" style="s2">conceivably be distributed and you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.520" end="00:06:40.039" style="s2">do it at home in fact our phone very</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.440" end="00:06:42.440" style="s2">much so did blood type testing last</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.039" end="00:06:43.789" style="s2">night all four of us I thought I knew my</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.440" end="00:06:45.740" style="s2">blood type I turned out to be right</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.789" end="00:06:48.020" style="s2">based on a test I&#39;d done many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.740" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">this was a de facto paternity test for</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.020" end="00:06:53.090" style="s2">our children as well I wasn&#39;t worried</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:55.220" style="s2">were you worried I was okay good so</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.090" end="00:06:56.810" style="s2">anyway yes those kinds of tests could be</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.220" end="00:06:59.150" style="s2">distributed and that would tell you if</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.810" end="00:07:01.310" style="s2">you had been exposed at a high level</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">such that you had circulating antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.310" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t tell you whether you had it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.919" style="s2">or not that&#39;s so it&#39;s partially yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:08.030" style="s2">partially no undo it yourself so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.919" end="00:07:10.220" style="s2">a question you know where and body can</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.030" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">we sample certainly saliva probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.220" end="00:07:18.740" style="s2">blood probably fecal and I mean those</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:20.630" style="s2">are the obvious easy choices okay do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.740" end="00:07:24.979" style="s2">think secretor status could be why some</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.630" end="00:07:27.700" style="s2">people are asymptomatic yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.979" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">tough question I think it&#39;s conceivable</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.700" end="00:07:31.370" style="s2">secretor status as I understand it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">not something that we know a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.370" end="00:07:37.789" style="s2">but it it is whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:39.800" style="s2">basically secrete the antigens of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.789" end="00:07:43.220" style="s2">blood type into bodily fluids like</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.800" end="00:07:46.220" style="s2">saliva and blood so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.220" end="00:07:48.289" style="s2">the same as are you a a B or a B what</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.220" end="00:07:49.639" style="s2">you say you have those antigens versus</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.289" end="00:07:51.830" style="s2">are you oh do you would not have any of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.639" end="00:07:54.680" style="s2">them but do you actually secrete them</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.830" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">into your bodily fluids yeah and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:08:00.169" style="s2">possible that these things could</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:02.510" style="s2">molecular ly gum up the works of corona</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.169" end="00:08:06.320" style="s2">virus and leave your tissues more intact</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.510" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s pure speculation it does mirror</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.320" end="00:08:12.169" style="s2">what some antibodies do which basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:15.289" style="s2">take things like viral particles and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.169" end="00:08:16.580" style="s2">they glue them together so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.289" end="00:08:17.960" style="s2">be consumed by something like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.580" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">macrophage and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.960" end="00:08:21.710" style="s2">rendered harmless so I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.199" style="s2">conceivable but we don&#39;t know enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.710" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">about it to say mm-hmm let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.199" end="00:08:31.400" style="s2">request to invite a discussion with MSO</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">an Austrian economist with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.400" end="00:08:36.469" style="s2">game B Robert Murphy any thoughts on the</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.469" end="00:08:39.649" style="s2">breathing to boost immunity let&#39;s speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.510" end="00:08:42.169" style="s2">a little bit to this phrase boost</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.649" end="00:08:43.640" style="s2">immunity yeah boost immunity is one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.169" end="00:08:46.250" style="s2">these phrases that gets tossed about</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.640" end="00:08:51.770" style="s2">that has very little meaning the immune</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.250" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">system is an amazing piece of non</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.770" end="00:08:56.750" style="s2">engineering as it were and it functions</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.790" style="s2">it has some general components like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.750" end="00:09:01.190" style="s2">macrophages that I just described it to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.790" end="00:09:05.149" style="s2">go around basically collecting garbage</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.190" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">including pathogens and it has a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.149" end="00:09:10.490" style="s2">of what&#39;s called specific immunity the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:13.100" style="s2">circulating humoral immunity which has</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.490" end="00:09:16.100" style="s2">to be targeted at the very signature of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.100" end="00:09:19.250" style="s2">the the pathogen in question there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.100" end="00:09:21.470" style="s2">almost no meaning to boost immunity with</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.250" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">respect to the second now it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.470" end="00:09:25.100" style="s2">you can compromise immunity by not</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:26.390" style="s2">having enough sleep or being dehydrator</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.100" end="00:09:29.240" style="s2">or something like this causing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.390" end="00:09:32.779" style="s2">system to falter but boosting immunity</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.240" end="00:09:36.140" style="s2">beyond a healthy status is very often a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.779" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">phrase that is used without much meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.140" end="00:09:40.550" style="s2">to it it&#39;s often a kind of quackery all</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:43.459" style="s2">right you know if your if your if your</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.550" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">system could simply be functioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.459" end="00:09:47.540" style="s2">better why isn&#39;t it well therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:48.860" style="s2">know if it if it&#39;s not because either a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.540" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">cost to the thing that you&#39;ve now just</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.860" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">innovated that you don&#39;t know about or</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:53.899" style="s2">you haven&#39;t actually innovated anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:56.209" style="s2">yes I would say if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.899" end="00:09:58.279" style="s2">engage in Yogi type breathing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.209" end="00:10:00.470" style="s2">unlikely to hurt you unless you do it</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.470" end="00:10:04.700" style="s2">kovat 19 so maybe if you&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.810" end="00:10:06.950" style="s2">yogi type breathing it&#39;s unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.700" end="00:10:10.070" style="s2">hurt you but do it with proper distance</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.950" end="00:10:11.959" style="s2">from other human beings yes very good</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.070" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">to what extent you think Dawkins concept</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.959" end="00:10:15.320" style="s2">for the extended phenotype the concept</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.320" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">will apply to the evolution of society</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.690" end="00:10:23.240" style="s2">and politics following code 19&#39;s decline</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">well I&#39;m more or less think that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.240" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">always applies to the way societies</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.910" end="00:11:05.629" style="s2">fans or Dark Horse comic fans I became</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.499" end="00:11:10.249" style="s2">aware of Dark Horse Comics</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.189" end="00:11:27.379" style="s2">Katy Perry on the street so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.230" end="00:11:29.569" style="s2">tells you how much of a fan yes I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.379" end="00:11:32.239" style="s2">also made aware I knew who Katy Perry</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.569" end="00:11:36.109" style="s2">was but somebody alerted me that he has</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.239" end="00:11:41.889" style="s2">a very popular song called Dark Horse so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.109" end="00:11:44.449" style="s2">anyway no we&#39;re not fans you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.889" end="00:11:49.339" style="s2">we&#39;re more rusty Rockets fans let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.449" end="00:11:53.480" style="s2">it that way okay I truly value these</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.339" end="00:11:57.589" style="s2">talks thank you how are so many</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.819" end="00:12:32.629" style="s2">fatality rate probably closer to the 0.5</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.839" end="00:12:36.139" style="s2">it&#39;s much much different from the boy I</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.670" end="00:13:45.470" style="s2">you&#39;re very welcome</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.550" end="00:13:46.970" style="s2">Jonathan storm can you explain patos</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.470" end="00:13:50.990" style="s2">paradox and give your thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.970" end="00:13:54.770" style="s2">idea this is a big topic paedos paradox</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.990" end="00:13:57.230" style="s2">is the observation that although cell</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.770" end="00:13:59.180" style="s2">size is similar between organisms and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.230" end="00:14:00.830" style="s2">therefore one would expect vastly more</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.180" end="00:14:02.840" style="s2">cancer in bigger animals because they</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.830" end="00:14:04.280" style="s2">have more cells that in fact big animals</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.840" end="00:14:06.950" style="s2">have much less cancer than you would</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.280" end="00:14:09.110" style="s2">expect it is a fascinating observation</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.950" end="00:14:11.300" style="s2">when I&#39;ve thought a lot about I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.110" end="00:14:13.220" style="s2">the answer comes down to telomeres I</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.300" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">will have to go through that explanation</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.220" end="00:14:18.410" style="s2">another time but in essence you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:21.140" style="s2">another parameter that is scaling which</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.410" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">is the tolerance for what I&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.140" end="00:14:27.110" style="s2">proto tumors so anyway we will return to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:28.280" style="s2">that another time Jonathan okay what are</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.110" end="00:14:30.140" style="s2">some of the most common effects of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.280" end="00:14:31.490" style="s2">stress on human physiology and are there</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.140" end="00:14:32.870" style="s2">any cool bio hacks that you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.490" end="00:14:35.720" style="s2">recommend to help people fortify</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.870" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">themselves eg ie again wim HOF breathing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.720" end="00:14:40.610" style="s2">but the hashtag make politics boring</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">again yeah thank you for that militant</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.610" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">moderate so you know the the common</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:49.490" style="s2">effects of stress are the usual things</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:51.260" style="s2">that we&#39;ve said here and in our first</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.490" end="00:14:54.110" style="s2">live stream insufficient sleep</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.260" end="00:14:56.490" style="s2">insufficient hydration insufficient</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.490" end="00:15:03.149" style="s2">food and then there are some things</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.910" end="00:15:04.589" style="s2">around timing which 20 years ago no one</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.149" end="00:15:06.450" style="s2">was really thinking about so something</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.589" end="00:15:08.820" style="s2">like intermittent fasting appears to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.450" end="00:15:11.160" style="s2">actually be very effective for many</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.820" end="00:15:13.080" style="s2">people with regard to reducing</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.160" end="00:15:17.070" style="s2">physiological stress at the dietary</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.080" end="00:15:19.170" style="s2">level a few things that have been used</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.070" end="00:15:20.940" style="s2">in various parts of the world for many</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.170" end="00:15:23.070" style="s2">years but are now gaining traction in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.940" end="00:15:25.260" style="s2">the West things like turmeric seem to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.070" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">have some value potentially at the</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:39.000" style="s2">outside certainly I would say story from</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.830" end="00:15:41.880" style="s2">my own life the cost that I was paying</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.000" end="00:15:44.339" style="s2">in terms of health and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.880" end="00:15:49.050" style="s2">susceptibility to in particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.339" end="00:15:51.000" style="s2">respiratory viruses for ingesting wheat</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.050" end="00:15:53.520" style="s2">which I was very allergic to and did not</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.000" end="00:15:56.459" style="s2">know the cost was incredibly high and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.520" end="00:15:58.709" style="s2">basically it manifest as body-wide</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.459" end="00:16:01.410" style="s2">inflammation that was affecting every</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.709" end="00:16:04.560" style="s2">system badly in order to discover that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.410" end="00:16:06.570" style="s2">had this allergy I had to go to extreme</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.560" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">lengths to eliminate wheat from my diet</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.570" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">completely 98% is not nearly good enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.230" style="s2">you have to really be careful and over a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">long period of time to see these things</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.230" end="00:16:17.910" style="s2">and I do think it points to the need for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.950" style="s2">all of us to figure out if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.910" end="00:16:22.050" style="s2">something that&#39;s common in our diet that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.950" end="00:16:25.079" style="s2">we are reacting to badly and just</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.050" end="00:16:27.390" style="s2">identify it so you can eliminate it but</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.079" end="00:16:30.329" style="s2">just to just pinpoint this thing you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.390" end="00:16:32.459" style="s2">said again an elimination diet needs to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.329" end="00:16:34.230" style="s2">be an absolute elimination diet to work</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.459" end="00:16:36.690" style="s2">or else not only don&#39;t you have the data</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.230" end="00:16:38.100" style="s2">you think you do well it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.690" end="00:16:39.930" style="s2">don&#39;t have the data that you think you</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.100" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">do if you just did a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.930" end="00:16:43.740" style="s2">whatever it is you&#39;re eliminating from</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:45.420" style="s2">your diet and you will be confused into</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.740" end="00:16:47.399" style="s2">thinking that therefore you now know</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.420" end="00:16:49.260" style="s2">that that item whether it&#39;s wheat or</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.399" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">peanuts or chocolate or eggs or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.260" end="00:16:54.029" style="s2">it is you will be confusing to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.990" end="00:16:55.980" style="s2">that it&#39;s not a problem if you just</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.029" end="00:16:59.130" style="s2">reduced the amount that you were eating</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.980" end="00:17:01.410" style="s2">so that&#39;s a bit bit far afield from the</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.740" end="00:17:29.550" style="s2">can certainly have a big effect on your</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.650" end="00:18:14.820" style="s2">contracted it and so so if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.929" end="00:18:16.200" style="s2">negative now but you become positive or</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.100" end="00:18:28.020" style="s2">theory comes in really handy though</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.690" end="00:18:29.910" style="s2">because yes you you are in a position to</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.910" end="00:18:33.570" style="s2">just isolating yourself because anybody</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.570" end="00:18:37.429" style="s2">then get it at least from you and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.580" end="00:18:41.670" style="s2">therefore won&#39;t die as a result of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.429" end="00:18:43.530" style="s2">behavior but the cost of isolating goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.670" end="00:18:45.870" style="s2">to you and the benefit goes to all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.530" end="00:18:47.580" style="s2">these people you&#39;ll never know and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.870" end="00:18:48.929" style="s2">the game theory does not support this</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.580" end="00:18:51.179" style="s2">behavior even though it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.929" end="00:18:55.080" style="s2">thing to do so do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.179" end="00:18:56.309" style="s2">ignore the game theory would you be</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.080" end="00:19:01.590" style="s2">concerned about taking a hastily</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.309" end="00:19:04.370" style="s2">developed and tested vaccine yes under</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.590" end="00:19:08.700" style="s2">these circumstances I would be less</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.370" end="00:19:10.260" style="s2">hesitant than under circumstances where</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.700" end="00:19:11.790" style="s2">so for instance you know we&#39;re all our</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.260" end="00:19:13.380" style="s2">entire family is vaccinated against</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.790" end="00:19:14.910" style="s2">yellow fever which most viewers probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.380" end="00:19:19.140" style="s2">aren&#39;t because you haven&#39;t had reason to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.910" end="00:19:20.580" style="s2">be vaccinated against it if if the CDC</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.140" end="00:19:21.460" style="s2">came out with a new vaccination for</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.580" end="00:19:23.049" style="s2">yellow fever and said</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.460" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">well this is 2% more effective but we</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.049" end="00:19:26.590" style="s2">just developed it there&#39;s no way that if</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:29.559" style="s2">our titers were low and we needed a new</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.590" end="00:19:31.149" style="s2">yellow fever vaccination that I would up</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.559" end="00:19:32.890" style="s2">for us or our children to get the new</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.149" end="00:19:35.860" style="s2">one all right so this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.890" end="00:19:37.090" style="s2">different situation than for a disease</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.860" end="00:19:40.929" style="s2">that we&#39;ve already long had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.090" end="00:19:42.130" style="s2">vaccination a back seen for or where it</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.929" end="00:19:44.740" style="s2">exists only in certain parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.130" end="00:19:46.690" style="s2">world and you can protect yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.740" end="00:19:49.270" style="s2">simply by not going to those places for</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.690" end="00:19:51.580" style="s2">the moment so if I would also want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.270" end="00:19:54.399" style="s2">say in answer to Arthur&#39;s question here</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.580" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">that this is a place where I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.399" end="00:19:58.330" style="s2">really want the testing because as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:00.610" style="s2">described in our first live stream</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.330" end="00:20:02.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong possibility that some</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.610" end="00:20:05.110" style="s2">or all of the people in our nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.350" end="00:20:07.659" style="s2">family had kovat 19 back before it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.110" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">understood that it was in the US in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.659" end="00:20:13.240" style="s2">significant way and if we have had it we</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:15.309" style="s2">may effectively already be immune or</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.240" end="00:20:16.899" style="s2">close to immune to it in which case I</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.309" end="00:20:19.510" style="s2">would definitely not want to take the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.899" end="00:20:20.919" style="s2">risk of a novel vaccine whereas if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.510" end="00:20:22.899" style="s2">haven&#39;t had it I would be much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.919" end="00:20:24.520" style="s2">inclined you know I would like to know</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.899" end="00:20:27.789" style="s2">something about how risky it is thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.520" end="00:20:30.460" style="s2">to be but I know full well that without</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.789" end="00:20:32.710" style="s2">following people for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.460" end="00:20:34.809" style="s2">extended period of time after such a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.710" end="00:20:36.669" style="s2">thing you can&#39;t know with any certainty</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.809" end="00:20:38.230" style="s2">that what you&#39;re dealing with is safe</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.669" end="00:20:43.630" style="s2">I&#39;m dealing with a calculated risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.230" end="00:20:45.429" style="s2">there&#39;s also the question of what how</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.630" end="00:20:46.809" style="s2">much does taking the vaccine lower your</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.429" end="00:20:49.090" style="s2">risk of contracting the disease</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.809" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">so if acts seen is never 100% protection</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.090" end="00:20:52.779" style="s2">and for instance I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:55.299" style="s2">cholera vaccine which Bret and I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.779" end="00:20:57.070" style="s2">lived and worked in places with all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.299" end="00:20:59.799" style="s2">tropical diseases you can think of and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.070" end="00:21:01.179" style="s2">have considered all of the vaccines and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.799" end="00:21:04.029" style="s2">we certainly got yellow fever when we</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.179" end="00:21:08.380" style="s2">needed it and right the others never got</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.029" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">cholera vaccine in part because cholera</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.380" end="00:21:11.830" style="s2">affects you if you do not have access to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:13.090" style="s2">fresh water and we were always in places</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.830" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">where we would be able to get fresh</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.090" end="00:21:17.710" style="s2">water but more to the point the cholera</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">vaccine has an efficacy that is so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.710" end="00:21:22.360" style="s2">less than 50% that the risks of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:24.700" style="s2">vaccine which there are always risks to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.360" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">any drug that you will take seemed far</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.700" end="00:21:29.260" style="s2">higher than the benefits of taking the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:30.850" style="s2">vaccine so built into the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.260" end="00:21:32.740" style="s2">question about how concerned you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.850" end="00:21:34.540" style="s2">be about taking a hastily developed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.740" end="00:21:36.070" style="s2">tested vaccine is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.540" end="00:21:40.060" style="s2">what are the people who hastily</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.070" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">developed it I think its efficacy is all</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.060" end="00:21:44.470" style="s2">right thoughts on oh so this is Nate</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:47.500" style="s2">asks thoughts on creating a tax filter</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.470" end="00:21:49.090" style="s2">disaster savings fund like the HSA or</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.500" end="00:21:50.710" style="s2">IRA to encourage companies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.090" end="00:21:52.750" style="s2">individuals to create nest eggs for</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.710" end="00:21:54.610" style="s2">these types of situations and mitigate</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.750" end="00:21:58.780" style="s2">the need of bailouts borrowed against</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.610" end="00:22:03.850" style="s2">the future these are good ideas what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.780" end="00:22:06.220" style="s2">would say is we need some system and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.850" end="00:22:09.550" style="s2">can&#39;t see how it does not emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.220" end="00:22:11.380" style="s2">either an incentive that is built by a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.550" end="00:22:14.020" style="s2">large governmental structure that is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.380" end="00:22:17.620" style="s2">sensitive to the lower level game theory</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.020" end="00:22:21.100" style="s2">or deployed by government itself so</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.620" end="00:22:22.690" style="s2">these ideas may be good ones what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.100" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">would like to see is the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.690" end="00:22:28.540" style="s2">ones at the least cost and really what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">we need is very smart people who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.540" end="00:22:33.660" style="s2">broad minded to engage the question of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">what is the best way to protect against</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.660" end="00:22:40.030" style="s2">plausible crises you know and and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:43.150" style="s2">would it be constructed to to resist</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.030" end="00:22:45.780" style="s2">captures for example and the game theory</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.150" end="00:22:48.040" style="s2">enters again - so the wording here is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.780" end="00:22:49.390" style="s2">creating a tax sheltered disaster saving</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.040" end="00:22:51.400" style="s2">fund to encourage companies and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.390" end="00:22:53.950" style="s2">individuals to mitigate the need for</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.400" end="00:22:56.620" style="s2">bailouts well if companies have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.950" end="00:22:59.230" style="s2">encouraged to create these things but</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.620" end="00:23:01.540" style="s2">bailouts may still be coming because the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.230" end="00:23:05.170" style="s2">government tends to do bailouts then</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.540" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">those companies that that contributed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.170" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">such a thing may actually end up failing</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:13.660" style="s2">because of their good intentions so</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:15.630" style="s2">there need there needs to be some way to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.660" end="00:23:19.060" style="s2">make sure that those people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.630" end="00:23:20.920" style="s2">would those those corporations and those</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.060" end="00:23:23.110" style="s2">individuals who actually did save for</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.920" end="00:23:25.510" style="s2">the future did not take a hit because</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.110" end="00:23:27.130" style="s2">they were saving for the future yep</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.510" end="00:23:29.050" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a really important point</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.760" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">suspicion is that bandanas are far more</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.550" end="00:25:04.490" style="s2">effective I would very much as you Jason</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:06.980" style="s2">would like to see the bandana tested and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.490" end="00:25:08.120" style="s2">in fact in our either first or second</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.980" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">live stream I mentioned that I was</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.810" style="s2">the bandana before kovat 19 was ever a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.070" end="00:25:19.700" style="s2">thing I wanted to see how it was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.810" end="00:25:21.890" style="s2">affect cold and flu and anyway I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.700" end="00:25:24.770" style="s2">still hoping to see that data but I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.890" end="00:25:27.110" style="s2">think the methodology tests something</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.770" end="00:25:30.290" style="s2">but it is not clear to me that it tests</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.110" end="00:25:34.360" style="s2">the correct parameter to predict in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.290" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">the test was generated in part to model</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.360" end="00:25:40.850" style="s2">dust storm resistance if I&#39;m remembering</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:42.830" style="s2">the paper correctly so what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.850" end="00:25:45.800" style="s2">is my test in which I took the bandana</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.830" end="00:25:50.810" style="s2">and I put it over a camera lens and came</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.800" end="00:25:53.090" style="s2">up with greater than 99% effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.810" end="00:25:54.920" style="s2">at intercepting photons says one thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.090" end="00:25:57.170" style="s2">this test says something else but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.920" end="00:25:59.270" style="s2">gold standard is a test in which people</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.170" end="00:25:59.510" style="s2">wear these things and we see whether or</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.270" end="00:26:00.950" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.510" end="00:26:03.260" style="s2">they have a reduced likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.950" end="00:26:04.790" style="s2">contracting colds and flu viruses aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.260" end="00:26:07.220" style="s2">the same as photons but they&#39;re also not</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.790" end="00:26:08.690" style="s2">the same as salt water and I will say we</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.220" end="00:26:14.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t end up talking about today but</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:15.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a 20-17 paper the the blurb from</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.090" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">which is basically that if you salt your</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.950" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">masks that work a lot better than if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:23.210" style="s2">don&#39;t salt your masks now it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:25.610" style="s2">that simple and these these researchers</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.210" end="00:26:29.540" style="s2">were taking apart I believe it was n95</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.610" end="00:26:30.770" style="s2">masks and immersing the middle layer in</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.540" end="00:26:32.660" style="s2">salt water and then putting them back</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.770" end="00:26:35.870" style="s2">together and finding that they became</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.660" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">effectively an 100 masks almost and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.870" end="00:26:45.830" style="s2">idea there is excuse me that upon</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:48.820" style="s2">exposure to a virus that is contained in</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.830" end="00:26:51.980" style="s2">a water droplet the salt water basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.820" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">that the salt in the mask crystallizes</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.980" end="00:26:56.450" style="s2">ardi crystallizes around the virus</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:56.900" style="s2">surrounds it and renders it completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.450" end="00:26:59.180" style="s2">useless</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.900" end="00:27:02.270" style="s2">so it basically traps even more</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.180" end="00:27:05.090" style="s2">effectively to a large degree the viral</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.270" end="00:27:06.920" style="s2">particles then then an unsalted mask</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.090" end="00:27:08.390" style="s2">does now I have no idea if you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.920" end="00:27:10.130" style="s2">salt your bandana and have the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.390" end="00:27:12.590" style="s2">effect you would at least chap your face</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.130" end="00:27:15.080" style="s2">for sure if you did so right or yeah any</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.590" end="00:27:17.660" style="s2">of the masks this is the sort of mask as</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.080" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">well right this mask which was made by</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.660" end="00:27:24.730" style="s2">your mom yeah this mask which was which</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:28.910" style="s2">was made by my mom right so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.730" end="00:27:30.890" style="s2">washable cloth mask so I feel certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.910" end="00:27:32.420" style="s2">that actually soaking in insults would</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.890" end="00:27:33.850" style="s2">have the same effect because I think it</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.420" end="00:27:39.110" style="s2">probably would but you would end up with</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">with skin issues but so given given that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.110" end="00:27:45.770" style="s2">we know that salt water has a distinct</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:48.680" style="s2">effect on viruses throwing salt water at</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.770" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">masks and using that as the proxy for</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.680" end="00:27:51.620" style="s2">how viruses will move through those</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:54.050" style="s2">masks seems like actually a very poor</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.620" end="00:27:55.700" style="s2">proxy yeah I think it is a poor proxy I</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.050" end="00:27:58.130" style="s2">mean it may be a very good proxy for</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.700" end="00:28:02.360" style="s2">their primary objective which was to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.130" end="00:28:04.670" style="s2">test for their dust storms but yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.360" end="00:28:09.860" style="s2">any case all right</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.670" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">Nord REE says good job - Zac I</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.860" end="00:28:15.950" style="s2">I would just say for our part we also</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">are very fond of Zack we regard him as a</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.700" end="00:28:27.410" style="s2">seems like woken us has taken a backseat</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.980" end="00:28:29.000" style="s2">during this age of Kovan do you think</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.410" end="00:28:31.880" style="s2">once this is over we will revert back or</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.880" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna revert back I have wondered</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.980" end="00:28:37.820" style="s2">the same thing Jessie it&#39;s almost hard</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.820" end="00:28:43.280" style="s2">bickering about it so anyway maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.490" end="00:28:45.830" style="s2">there is something to that maybe I guess</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.280" end="00:28:47.660" style="s2">I doubt that it will disappear entirely</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.830" end="00:28:49.340" style="s2">I just don&#39;t see that happening it&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.909" end="00:30:47.789" style="s2">question okay what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.019" end="00:30:51.450" style="s2">the problem of combinatorial inflation</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.789" end="00:30:54.330" style="s2">for the origins of species you still</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.450" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">believe in Darwinian evolution yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.330" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">yeah so I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:02.730" style="s2">combinatorial inflation is an actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:05.850" style="s2">challenge to the Origin of Species I do</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.730" end="00:31:07.740" style="s2">believe define it not really I want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.850" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a mathematical challenge</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.740" end="00:31:15.330" style="s2">that there&#39;s too much possibility space</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:18.440" style="s2">for Darwinian selection to account for</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.330" end="00:31:22.110" style="s2">what we see I do think that the modern</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.440" end="00:31:24.210" style="s2">version of Darwinism that we teach is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.110" end="00:31:26.190" style="s2">broken in a couple of ways I do not</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.210" end="00:31:29.639" style="s2">regard that as a flaw in Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.190" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">because I believe that the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.639" end="00:31:33.419" style="s2">the flaw that we have is more and better</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.740" end="00:31:35.879" style="s2">Darwinism in other words I think Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.419" end="00:31:37.860" style="s2">got it right in part by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.879" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">fact that he couldn&#39;t address details</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.860" end="00:31:43.289" style="s2">and so gave a broad picture that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:45.210" style="s2">correct but the mechanistic details I</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.289" end="00:31:46.860" style="s2">don&#39;t believe we have the full story yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.210" end="00:31:48.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe we have a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.860" end="00:31:50.309" style="s2">enough version of the story to account</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.600" end="00:31:52.169" style="s2">for many of the things we see which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.309" end="00:31:55.320" style="s2">creating false hope for many of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.169" end="00:31:58.259" style="s2">people who think Darwinism is broken but</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.320" end="00:32:00.299" style="s2">I would say ironically enough when it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.259" end="00:32:03.990" style="s2">comes to Darwinism keep the faith you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.299" end="00:32:05.940" style="s2">see Darwin was right okay where are we</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.990" end="00:32:09.389" style="s2">any advice for people who have had a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.940" end="00:32:13.620" style="s2">significant other hospitalized oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.389" end="00:32:15.659" style="s2">hard since you can&#39;t visit yeah III</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.620" end="00:32:17.639" style="s2">don&#39;t know how possible it is we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.659" end="00:32:20.789" style="s2">not been in the situation I would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.639" end="00:32:23.250" style="s2">what you want to do is figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.789" end="00:32:25.649" style="s2">mechanism where you can stay in contact</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.250" end="00:32:28.289" style="s2">I think you know I&#39;ve read some terrible</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.649" end="00:32:30.509" style="s2">stories about people dying alone because</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.289" end="00:32:33.989" style="s2">their families couldn&#39;t visit</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.509" end="00:32:37.259" style="s2">and really think ahead of time about how</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.989" end="00:32:38.729" style="s2">you will stay in contact and see if</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.259" end="00:32:40.679" style="s2">there&#39;s not some mechanism I would love</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.729" end="00:32:44.129" style="s2">for somebody to solve solve the question</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.679" end="00:32:45.479" style="s2">indeed okay what do you think current</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.129" end="00:32:50.789" style="s2">problems have to say about religious</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.479" end="00:32:53.399" style="s2">prescriptions on certain foods ice I</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.789" end="00:32:55.469" style="s2">think I think the question is about some</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.399" end="00:32:58.589" style="s2">kind of precautionary principle where</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.469" end="00:33:00.719" style="s2">the deity is thought to be finicky and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.589" end="00:33:04.229" style="s2">therefore would probably frown on eating</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.719" end="00:33:06.329" style="s2">exotic things from other places okay but</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.229" end="00:33:09.059" style="s2">which which we would call you know in</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.329" end="00:33:11.549" style="s2">our language these are often literally</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.059" end="00:33:14.429" style="s2">false metaphorically true dietary laws</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.549" end="00:33:16.169" style="s2">like kosher and halal and such which</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.429" end="00:33:17.969" style="s2">have made terrific sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.169" end="00:33:20.459" style="s2">environments in which they evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.969" end="00:33:22.019" style="s2">stuck and some of them may make less</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.459" end="00:33:24.539" style="s2">sense now in the age of refrigeration</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.019" end="00:33:26.119" style="s2">for instance pork is no longer going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.539" end="00:33:30.329" style="s2">give Farrah many people of trichinosis</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.119" end="00:33:33.539" style="s2">but certainly religious prescriptions on</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.539" end="00:33:39.299" style="s2">have that have endured through time and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.699" end="00:33:42.899" style="s2">through some cultural change had some</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.299" end="00:33:44.909" style="s2">adaptive function that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.899" end="00:33:47.099" style="s2">careful about abandoning until we know</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.909" end="00:33:49.349" style="s2">what that adaptive function was yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.099" end="00:33:50.699" style="s2">problem is that these rules to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.349" end="00:33:52.769" style="s2">extent that they are sensible which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.699" end="00:33:54.690" style="s2">liable to be a great extent there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.769" end="00:33:57.089" style="s2">guarantee that rules that were sensible</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.690" end="00:33:58.379" style="s2">continue to be in such a novel error and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.089" end="00:34:00.719" style="s2">there&#39;s no guarantee that things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.379" end="00:34:03.239" style="s2">should have rules against them will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.719" end="00:34:05.429" style="s2">found in these texts because the texts</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.239" end="00:34:10.440" style="s2">evolved in response to a prior world</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.429" end="00:34:12.740" style="s2">that we just don&#39;t live in okay next</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.440" end="00:34:15.779" style="s2">question is is Jack&#39;s testing vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.740" end="00:34:19.470" style="s2">number on primates yet all right not</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.779" end="00:34:20.039" style="s2">sure what this means here let me take a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.470" end="00:34:26.279" style="s2">swing at it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.039" end="00:34:30.029" style="s2">okay there is talk about using micro</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.279" end="00:34:34.769" style="s2">seevis the mouse lemur as a new model</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.029" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">organism I would say I don&#39;t think it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.769" end="00:34:42.809" style="s2">up and running yet it is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:44.099" style="s2">useful also there&#39;s there are ethical</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.809" end="00:34:46.200" style="s2">considerations about using</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.099" end="00:34:48.899" style="s2">these animals but I would say in</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.200" end="00:34:50.279" style="s2">addition to mice yes and in part in</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.899" end="00:34:53.220" style="s2">response to the fact that the mice have</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.279" end="00:34:55.829" style="s2">proven to be bad models now the mice are</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.829" end="00:34:59.249" style="s2">freed Mike receivest not nearly as fast</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.749" end="00:35:00.450" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know how fast you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.249" end="00:35:02.489" style="s2">breed Mike receive it won&#39;t be as fast</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.450" end="00:35:03.960" style="s2">as mice but it could be comparatively</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.489" end="00:35:06.299" style="s2">fast because they&#39;re so tiny this is an</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.960" end="00:35:10.200" style="s2">animal we&#39;ve had experience with they</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.200" end="00:35:14.539" style="s2">particular has many little primates not</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.359" end="00:35:19.799" style="s2">monkeys so they&#39;re the smallest primate</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.539" end="00:35:23.569" style="s2">but in any case the danger if my</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.799" end="00:35:26.519" style="s2">telomere work is right then taking any</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.569" end="00:35:28.349" style="s2">small mammal and breeding it for profit</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.519" end="00:35:31.319" style="s2">is liable to produce exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.349" end="00:35:33.150" style="s2">telomeric flaw because you will end up</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.319" end="00:35:34.890" style="s2">breeding young animals to escape the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.150" end="00:35:36.779" style="s2">cost of senescence and when you do so</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.890" end="00:35:39.479" style="s2">you will select for the same problem as</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.779" end="00:35:43.979" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen in mice and hamsters in</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.979" end="00:35:47.309" style="s2">anyway I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.180" end="00:35:50.729" style="s2">you&#39;re asking about but if it is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.309" end="00:35:52.410" style="s2">real problem what do you think would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.729" end="00:35:54.269" style="s2">some ecological impacts of eliminating</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.269" end="00:35:59.609" style="s2">other species with similar detriments</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.690" end="00:36:03.499" style="s2">well let&#39;s just take mosquitoes for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.609" end="00:36:06.269" style="s2">moment mosquito isn&#39;t a species it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.499" end="00:36:07.859" style="s2">probably thousands I don&#39;t know actually</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.519" end="00:36:24.509" style="s2">are you know low in the food chain which</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.200" end="00:36:25.950" style="s2">other things then eat and so you you</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.509" end="00:36:27.599" style="s2">take out all mosquitoes which would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.950" end="00:36:30.599" style="s2">frankly impossible throughout the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.599" end="00:36:33.420" style="s2">and you will collapse ecosystems because</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.599" end="00:36:37.319" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing for the things at the</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.530" end="00:37:22.900" style="s2">a hard question to answer I think</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.340" end="00:37:52.270" style="s2">in barns and houses and livestock for</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.150" end="00:37:55.240" style="s2">blood side so this is a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.270" end="00:37:56.500" style="s2">would say the rest of the question since</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.240" end="00:37:58.770" style="s2">we know what it is but you didn&#39;t say it</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.500" end="00:38:04.260" style="s2">out loud as features Addington virulence</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.770" end="00:38:09.370" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;ve seen with for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.260" end="00:38:12.130" style="s2">rabies in vampire bats that this has</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.370" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">become a serious problem but it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.130" end="00:38:17.320" style="s2">actually human caused that vampire bats</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:19.450" style="s2">are actually exceedingly rare creatures</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.320" end="00:38:21.220" style="s2">in their natural environment because</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.450" end="00:38:25.030" style="s2">blood meat blood meals aren&#39;t all that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.220" end="00:38:26.890" style="s2">common in tropical forests when humans</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.030" end="00:38:28.590" style="s2">start raising livestock that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.890" end="00:38:32.500" style="s2">effectively sitting ducks for these</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.590" end="00:38:35.560" style="s2">these vampire bats we create an</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.500" end="00:38:37.660" style="s2">opportunity for these pathogens to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.560" end="00:38:39.790" style="s2">circulate in a way that human beings can</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.660" end="00:38:42.790" style="s2">encounter them there&#39;s certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.790" end="00:38:45.580" style="s2">question about entering caves that would</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.790" end="00:38:47.980" style="s2">otherwise have been impassable as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.580" end="00:38:49.180" style="s2">result of them being too dark so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.980" end="00:38:51.340" style="s2">all of these dangers and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.180" end="00:38:54.180" style="s2">also the other question which is human</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.340" end="00:38:57.930" style="s2">beings interacting with these species</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.180" end="00:39:01.650" style="s2">may be transmitting the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.930" end="00:39:04.849" style="s2">nose fungus that&#39;s killing so many so</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.650" end="00:39:08.309" style="s2">many animals so anyway the bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.849" end="00:39:10.349" style="s2">is that you have a world of pathogenic</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.309" end="00:39:12.630" style="s2">phenomena and then you have human beings</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.349" end="00:39:14.940" style="s2">behaving in novel ways that are causing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.630" end="00:39:16.829" style="s2">new opportunities for those pathogens to</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.940" end="00:39:18.300" style="s2">circulate and it&#39;s been bad for humans</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.829" end="00:39:22.410" style="s2">and it&#39;s been bad for these creatures</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.300" end="00:39:25.380" style="s2">and in general we need to start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.410" end="00:39:27.480" style="s2">about not simply innovating because we</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.380" end="00:39:30.450" style="s2">can and then discovering that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.480" end="00:39:32.869" style="s2">downside of it is causing animals to go</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.450" end="00:39:35.400" style="s2">extinct or human beings to die by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.869" end="00:39:37.140" style="s2">thousands or millions that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.400" end="00:39:39.569" style="s2">we should also say that you know blood</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.140" end="00:39:40.980" style="s2">sucking in bats is restricted to three</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.569" end="00:39:42.839" style="s2">species of bats it&#39;s only three species</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.980" end="00:39:45.000" style="s2">of vampire bats out of well more than a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.839" end="00:39:46.530" style="s2">thousand species right and is that only</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.000" end="00:39:48.030" style="s2">one of those it&#39;s actually a mammal</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.530" end="00:39:48.599" style="s2">specialist and - or avian or the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.030" end="00:39:50.670" style="s2">way around</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.599" end="00:39:53.609" style="s2">yes it&#39;s only one of them is a mammal</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.670" end="00:39:59.430" style="s2">special so one species of bat out of out</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.609" end="00:40:01.500" style="s2">of as motives rotundus is one and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.430" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t kick Asian leave and it gets up</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.500" end="00:40:05.849" style="s2">in blood of humans it gets up into this</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.559" style="s2">very southern part of the southern US I</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.849" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">think but it&#39;s a new world</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.559" end="00:40:11.910" style="s2">you know maybe right it&#39;s mostly not in</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.790" style="s2">the US I think it I think it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.910" end="00:40:17.960" style="s2">the it&#39;s you know it gets up into Mexico</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.790" end="00:40:20.970" style="s2">yep and down through I guess the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.960" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">yep it&#39;s not in the old world yep right</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.970" end="00:40:25.770" style="s2">so no vampire bats in the old world</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:27.930" style="s2">interesting that the story of vampires</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.770" end="00:40:29.790" style="s2">shows up in the old world yes what&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.930" end="00:40:31.380" style="s2">vampire bats are known as vampire bats</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.790" end="00:40:34.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the old world story having been</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.380" end="00:40:39.780" style="s2">grafted onto bats in the new world along</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.200" end="00:40:41.490" style="s2">with the epithet vampire which shows up</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.780" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">in many of the Latin names for bats that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.490" end="00:40:47.480" style="s2">don&#39;t ever drink blood of impressive</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:51.000" style="s2">vampire umm hiram yeah all these bats</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.480" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">but okay where are we a second one down</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.000" end="00:40:54.780" style="s2">Brett have you have you and Eric spoken</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.520" end="00:40:56.670" style="s2">about the overlap of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.780" end="00:40:58.500" style="s2">functions and epidemiological biology</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.670" end="00:41:02.670" style="s2">and what can we learn from this what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.500" end="00:41:04.740" style="s2">his take I was just asking Eric or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.670" end="00:41:06.770" style="s2">I should have him on and yeah he can</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.740" end="00:41:09.180" style="s2">answer that question I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.770" end="00:41:09.750" style="s2">all of the stuff is possible in</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.180" end="00:41:14.700" style="s2">mathematic</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.750" end="00:41:15.960" style="s2">times I don&#39;t know I mean this question</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.700" end="00:41:17.580" style="s2">is really about the interface between</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.960" end="00:41:19.350" style="s2">what we think about and what Eric thinks</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.580" end="00:41:22.470" style="s2">about I don&#39;t think we&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.350" end="00:41:24.180" style="s2">answering it on our own on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.470" end="00:41:25.590" style="s2">with Eric you Brett said that you need a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.180" end="00:41:27.210" style="s2">pen and paper to explain the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.590" end="00:41:30.660" style="s2">complexity of you social behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.210" end="00:41:32.280" style="s2">ants when can you make it so I do this a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.660" end="00:41:33.660" style="s2">lot when I was teaching animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.280" end="00:41:35.460" style="s2">I loved it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.660" end="00:41:37.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of fun we&#39;re not going to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.460" end="00:41:40.860" style="s2">it for a bit but we could we could we</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.770" end="00:41:41.640" style="s2">could start doing little technical bits</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.860" end="00:41:45.510" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.640" end="00:41:48.390" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s tremendously fun and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.510" end="00:41:49.770" style="s2">the takeaways are your sisters or your</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.390" end="00:41:52.140" style="s2">full sisters or three-quarters related</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.770" end="00:41:54.320" style="s2">to one another and males don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.140" end="00:41:58.260" style="s2">fathers those are a couple to take aways</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.320" end="00:41:59.910" style="s2">if you&#39;re an aunt if you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.260" end="00:42:05.610" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.910" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">let&#39;s see tune in drop out says time</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.610" end="00:42:09.750" style="s2">important timing more important looking</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:11.250" style="s2">at the situation in Hong Kong with riots</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.750" end="00:42:12.990" style="s2">and protests the degree to which this</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.250" end="00:42:14.760" style="s2">virus was able to clear the streets</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.990" end="00:42:17.640" style="s2">simply cannot be dismissed as</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.760" end="00:42:20.040" style="s2">coincidence I would not say it cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.640" end="00:42:21.750" style="s2">dismissed as coincidence I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.040" end="00:42:24.660" style="s2">raises a question about whether it could</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.750" end="00:42:26.520" style="s2">be something else but the fact is if the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.660" end="00:42:28.350" style="s2">virus is plausible on its own and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.520" end="00:42:30.630" style="s2">protests happen and the way they would</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.350" end="00:42:33.140" style="s2">interact results in the clearing of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.630" end="00:42:41.180" style="s2">streets we don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.140" end="00:42:41.180" style="s2">presumably it is it is mere coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.270" end="00:42:45.180" style="s2">regardless of initial circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.290" end="00:42:46.710" style="s2">would you say the CCP has weaponized the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.180" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">circumstances through their allegedly</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.710" end="00:42:50.460" style="s2">deliberate deliberate cover-ups</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:52.590" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly worsened impact around</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.460" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">the world you know Nate the nicest</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.590" end="00:42:57.180" style="s2">circumstances I wouldn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:43:00.510" style="s2">because I think the role that China</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.180" end="00:43:05.220" style="s2">plays with respect to producing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.510" end="00:43:07.500" style="s2">goods that keep the West running they</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.220" end="00:43:09.600" style="s2">could be doing things far more</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.600" end="00:43:16.520" style="s2">seen it doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:18.660" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can regard them as</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.930" end="00:43:23.950" style="s2">I think so</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.950" end="00:43:30.940" style="s2">yep thawing permafrost releasing ancient</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.110" end="00:43:34.860" style="s2">viruses is this a real threat or</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.940" end="00:43:40.450" style="s2">websites just posting clickbait both</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.860" end="00:43:43.990" style="s2">maybe I gotta say stranger things have</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.450" end="00:43:46.450" style="s2">happened but I wouldn&#39;t bet on this</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.990" end="00:43:51.010" style="s2">being likely because a virus would have</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.450" end="00:43:53.350" style="s2">to survive intact in the permafrost over</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.010" end="00:43:55.450" style="s2">such a long period of time now of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.350" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">permafrost is the right place if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.450" end="00:44:00.760" style="s2">gonna try to preserve it for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">period of time but viruses in general</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.850" end="00:44:12.490" style="s2">that live in places like the high sulfur</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.310" end="00:44:15.360" style="s2">pools in Yellowstone or deep Undine the</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:36.940" style="s2">viruses I don&#39;t think that we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">actually seen any examples of this on</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.940" end="00:44:40.150" style="s2">the other hand maybe you&#39;d have to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.850" style="s2">been there to know that that&#39;s where a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.150" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">virus came from well on the other other</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.850" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">hand you know with you know we can match</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:50.620" style="s2">up this virus to known viruses and bats</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.880" end="00:44:52.300" style="s2">and say yeah we&#39;re pretty sure this came</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.620" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">from one of these clients of bats and</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.300" end="00:44:56.380" style="s2">that says actually it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:58.390" style="s2">permafrost in this particular case so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.380" end="00:45:00.610" style="s2">would say there two other things one</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.390" end="00:45:02.140" style="s2">because the viruses have dispensed with</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.610" end="00:45:03.940" style="s2">the cells that make them do their work</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.140" end="00:45:06.100" style="s2">they&#39;re more capable of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.940" end="00:45:08.140" style="s2">extremophiles because the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.100" end="00:45:09.970" style="s2">would break down under extreme</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.140" end="00:45:14.530" style="s2">circumstances are largely not present</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.970" end="00:45:17.320" style="s2">but just as meat that is in the market</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.530" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">dead even if the animal was sick when it</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.320" end="00:45:21.340" style="s2">was alive is very often not in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:24.280" style="s2">position to transmit a virus because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.340" end="00:45:26.890" style="s2">isn&#39;t coughing for example permafrost is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.280" end="00:45:31.180" style="s2">even less coughing and so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.890" end="00:45:33.370" style="s2">that some virus was inhabiting mastodons</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.180" end="00:45:35.170" style="s2">and got frozen in the permafrost and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.370" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">remained viable it still doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.170" end="00:45:38.890" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:42.069" style="s2">have to get into a creature so I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.890" end="00:45:42.910" style="s2">say rule of thumb don&#39;t eat yellow</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.069" end="00:45:45.420" style="s2">permafrost</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.910" end="00:45:50.559" style="s2">you&#39;ll probably be alright excellent</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.420" end="00:45:52.119" style="s2">alright yes I think so so so many of our</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.559" end="00:45:53.740" style="s2">norms institutions of trust are</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.119" end="00:45:55.960" style="s2">predicated on preventing or punishing</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.740" end="00:45:57.460" style="s2">bad faith interactions the threat were</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.960" end="00:45:59.710" style="s2">facing doesn&#39;t require bad faith to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.460" end="00:46:02.050" style="s2">cause harm how do we recalibrate that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.710" end="00:46:06.280" style="s2">from the steel man podcast yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.050" end="00:46:09.190" style="s2">great question is well this is what</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.280" end="00:46:12.819" style="s2">human beings do right we take novel</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.190" end="00:46:15.309" style="s2">situations and we adapt ourselves and if</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.819" end="00:46:18.609" style="s2">you think about how this will have</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.309" end="00:46:24.910" style="s2">functioned in the past we have narrative</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.609" end="00:46:28.839" style="s2">stories to deal with phenomena in nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.910" end="00:46:31.990" style="s2">that have nothing to do with intent or</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.839" end="00:46:33.849" style="s2">anything like it and so the ancient way</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.990" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">to deal with this would be to encode it</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.849" end="00:46:39.339" style="s2">in some kind of a story where we you</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:41.079" style="s2">know fashion some you know enemy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.339" end="00:46:42.790" style="s2">the modern way to do it would be to get</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.079" end="00:46:44.589" style="s2">over that and say well this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.790" end="00:46:46.750" style="s2">phenomenon it has this nature there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.589" end="00:46:49.750" style="s2">these game theater theoretic obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.750" end="00:46:53.380" style="s2">to us dealing with it well and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.750" end="00:46:55.510" style="s2">to encode the literal story so I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.380" end="00:46:56.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the answer is we have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.510" end="00:47:00.099" style="s2">out what the literal story is and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.890" end="00:47:02.109" style="s2">we can teach it and begin to discuss its</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.099" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">meaning well I guess so you know I said</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.109" end="00:47:07.690" style="s2">this thing I guess at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:08.970" style="s2">last podcast about not being interested</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:11.470" style="s2">in taking pre modern or postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.970" end="00:47:13.540" style="s2">questions or approaches and only taking</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.470" end="00:47:16.869" style="s2">the modern one but your framing their of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.540" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">the narrative apparatus that all humans</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.869" end="00:47:21.400" style="s2">seem hooked into and particularly likely</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">to be compelled by even when the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.400" end="00:47:26.020" style="s2">narratives are wrong or misleading could</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:28.359" style="s2">therefore be seen as pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.020" end="00:47:30.130" style="s2">but I prefer to think of it as one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.359" end="00:47:33.549" style="s2">the many things that are evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.130" end="00:47:35.589" style="s2">and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.549" end="00:47:38.799" style="s2">majority of people will be just as</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.589" end="00:47:41.290" style="s2">compelled by a linear description of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.799" end="00:47:44.170" style="s2">facts as they will be by those facts</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.290" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">embedded in myth or allegory or parable</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.170" end="00:47:47.720" style="s2">or a good science fiction story or any</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:49.550" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.720" end="00:47:51.650" style="s2">of other things I think that there has</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.550" end="00:47:55.430" style="s2">to be a way to do what we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.650" end="00:47:58.040" style="s2">through narrative as well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.430" end="00:48:00.230" style="s2">disagree but I do think our tools are</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.040" end="00:48:02.420" style="s2">better to a understand the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.230" end="00:48:05.000" style="s2">mechanism and B to convey it and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.420" end="00:48:07.160" style="s2">know we&#39;re watching the world talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.000" end="00:48:09.560" style="s2">about fairly deep issues of virology and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.160" end="00:48:12.830" style="s2">epidemiology and mechanisms of infection</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.560" end="00:48:14.359" style="s2">and you know one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.830" end="00:48:16.910" style="s2">actually impresses me about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.359" end="00:48:18.700" style="s2">situation is that given something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.910" end="00:48:21.230" style="s2">has focused our attention people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.700" end="00:48:22.840" style="s2">many of them at least ready to level up</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.230" end="00:48:25.609" style="s2">and have that discussion so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.840" end="00:48:27.109" style="s2">arguing against narrative but I am</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.609" end="00:48:30.590" style="s2">arguing that some things just don&#39;t lend</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.109" end="00:48:33.070" style="s2">themselves to it it&#39;s true all right</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.590" end="00:48:33.070" style="s2">where are we</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.400" end="00:48:38.090" style="s2">thanks for addressing conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.480" end="00:48:39.560" style="s2">hypotheses great term we&#39;re doomed if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.090" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">stop questioning or discussing the jhen</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.560" end="00:48:42.740" style="s2">the gated institutional narrative</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:44.780" style="s2">especially during crises so a comment</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.740" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">and then a question thank you</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.780" end="00:48:49.609" style="s2">could the worldwide fragility we are now</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:52.550" style="s2">witnessing to do Tuco vat19 help explain</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.609" end="00:48:56.089" style="s2">the Fermi paradox yes yep of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.550" end="00:48:57.410" style="s2">absolutely the meaning being why is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.089" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">so quiet out there in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.410" end="00:49:02.420" style="s2">because there are things that challenge</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:03.740" style="s2">anybody who evolves to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.420" end="00:49:05.589" style="s2">they may be may be something other than</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.740" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">quiet so yes that will be game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.589" end="00:49:11.390" style="s2">flaws and the fragility we are seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">a natural evolved phenomenon one we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.390" end="00:49:17.089" style="s2">to get over or we will perish from it</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:19.190" style="s2">yeah non anti fragile civilizations do</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.089" end="00:49:20.410" style="s2">not go interstellar yes they do not get</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.190" end="00:49:23.270" style="s2">into the future</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.410" end="00:49:25.580" style="s2">all right are you familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.270" end="00:49:26.930" style="s2">Hendra virus it is a horse to human</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.580" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">transmissible disease originating from</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.930" end="00:49:31.670" style="s2">bats tear poets it&#39;s mega bats in</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">Australia I do not know the Hendra virus</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.670" end="00:49:39.440" style="s2">do you I don&#39;t and the idea that terror</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:41.720" style="s2">potent a virus to horses how would that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:44.390" style="s2">be I mean I guess maybe so pteropodidae</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.720" end="00:49:46.760" style="s2">our plant visiting bats of the old world</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.390" end="00:49:48.589" style="s2">and a flying foxes flying foxes there in</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.760" end="00:49:51.530" style="s2">Corydon pteropodidae</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.589" end="00:49:53.900" style="s2">these are non-echolocating very often</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.530" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">roost not all the species but many of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.900" end="00:50:00.620" style="s2">the species roost outside in trees</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:03.410" style="s2">so Wow I wonder what the story is I will</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.620" end="00:50:05.570" style="s2">say this though the conspicuous part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.410" end="00:50:08.840" style="s2">what you&#39;ve said the pteropodidae are</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.570" end="00:50:12.380" style="s2">bats and the only placental mammals in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.840" end="00:50:14.900" style="s2">Australia are bat natively some</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.380" end="00:50:18.080" style="s2">placental mammals have made it in to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.900" end="00:50:23.420" style="s2">Australia non natively including things</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.080" end="00:50:27.110" style="s2">like the dingo horses cats cats rats etc</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.420" end="00:50:30.410" style="s2">so the tarapada t transmitting a virus</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.110" end="00:50:34.360" style="s2">to horses in Australia is a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.410" end="00:50:37.850" style="s2">one Australian animal transmitted virus</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.360" end="00:50:41.420" style="s2">Australian endemic transmitting to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.850" end="00:50:43.910" style="s2">human introduced animal the horse that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.420" end="00:50:45.800" style="s2">then is transmitting to human is also</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.910" end="00:50:47.450" style="s2">human introduced who&#39;s also yes so</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.800" end="00:50:49.070" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a very intricate area I will</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.450" end="00:50:54.020" style="s2">look into it and see if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.070" end="00:50:55.550" style="s2">more to say yeah okay um Lewis would</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.020" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">like us to mention the Bretton Woods</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.550" end="00:51:00.050" style="s2">Agreement please and very important to</p>

<p begin="00:54:31.430" end="00:54:35.600" style="s2">time and I was thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.830" end="00:54:38.180" style="s2">happened when I emerged from my longest</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.600" end="00:54:39.530" style="s2">field season in Madagascar the one that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.180" end="00:54:42.530" style="s2">you weren&#39;t with me for and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.530" end="00:54:45.170" style="s2">field assistant with me but when I came</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.530" end="00:54:47.420" style="s2">out having been on this little island</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.170" end="00:54:48.800" style="s2">off the coast of Madagascar where I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.420" end="00:54:52.360" style="s2">in a tent</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.800" end="00:54:54.950" style="s2">showering in a waterfall studying frogs</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.360" end="00:54:56.630" style="s2">and it only had Jessica my field</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.950" end="00:54:57.800" style="s2">assistant and the two conservation</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.630" end="00:54:59.630" style="s2">agents the two mala Ghazi guys</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.800" end="00:55:02.900" style="s2">conservation agents on this island to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.630" end="00:55:04.130" style="s2">speak to you for five months and I went</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.900" end="00:55:06.080" style="s2">to visit my parents who were then living</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.130" end="00:55:07.670" style="s2">in London I found myself for the first</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.080" end="00:55:10.190" style="s2">time ever wanting to talk to people on</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.670" end="00:55:12.800" style="s2">the street it was actually very hungry</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.190" end="00:55:14.780" style="s2">for human interaction and human</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.800" end="00:55:17.840" style="s2">conversation in a way that I hadn&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.780" end="00:55:20.240" style="s2">known myself to be before but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.840" end="00:55:22.940" style="s2">is I&#39;d spent five months mostly tramping</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.240" end="00:55:25.190" style="s2">around the rainforest and not just not</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.940" end="00:55:27.490" style="s2">interacting very much with people and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.190" end="00:55:29.720" style="s2">takes a particular kind of personality</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.490" end="00:55:31.250" style="s2">when I when I used to teach animal</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.720" end="00:55:35.630" style="s2">behavior I would one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.250" end="00:55:37.580" style="s2">I was trying to do was show students</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.630" end="00:55:39.470" style="s2">through having them do fieldwork that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.580" end="00:55:41.120" style="s2">their romantic ideas of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.470" end="00:55:43.580" style="s2">you know study wolves which is just very</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.120" end="00:55:45.170" style="s2">very hard are usually not what it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.580" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">actually means to be in the field you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.170" end="00:55:47.960" style="s2">alone most of the time and you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:51.710" style="s2">your animals most of the time because</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.960" end="00:55:53.510" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to see you so this this</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.710" end="00:55:57.530" style="s2">situation we find ourselves in I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.510" end="00:56:00.710" style="s2">is easier for us especially than it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.530" end="00:56:03.140" style="s2">for the people who are hyper socially</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.180" end="00:57:34.690" style="s2">isometric strength ok isocaloric</p>

<p begin="00:57:37.390" end="00:57:44.470" style="s2">that is it&#39;s hard to answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.920" end="00:57:46.300" style="s2">but it&#39;s like high levels of cardio do</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.470" end="00:57:48.340" style="s2">make you weaker and more susceptible to</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.350" end="00:58:04.270" style="s2">I would say if isocaloric strength</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.540" end="00:58:06.970" style="s2">training is a real thing then you should</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.270" end="00:58:08.800" style="s2">engage in it responsibly oh that&#39;s such</p>

<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:08.599" style="s2">this is a great question here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.009" end="01:00:10.219" style="s2">thing it&#39;s not a good evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.599" end="01:00:12.349" style="s2">strategy and there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.219" end="01:00:14.420" style="s2">why we want to engage in a good</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.349" end="01:00:17.119" style="s2">evolutionary strategy a good</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.420" end="01:00:19.039" style="s2">evolutionary strategy here might involve</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.119" end="01:00:21.229" style="s2">simply letting the chips fall where they</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.039" end="01:00:23.930" style="s2">may and being productive while everybody</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.229" end="01:00:26.539" style="s2">else is offline right the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.930" end="01:00:29.660" style="s2">people that you care about are going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.539" end="01:00:31.009" style="s2">die and the fact is the value that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.660" end="01:00:35.569" style="s2">have to each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.009" end="01:00:37.339" style="s2">is a proxy for an ancient mechanism for</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.569" end="01:00:38.569" style="s2">getting your genes into the future but</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.339" end="01:00:39.710" style="s2">why the hell do you care about getting</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.569" end="01:00:41.210" style="s2">your genes into the future</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.710" end="01:00:42.769" style="s2">right that&#39;s what evolution cares about</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.210" end="01:00:46.460" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t care about it it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.769" end="01:00:47.900" style="s2">absurd goal so what I would say is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.460" end="01:00:50.119" style="s2">fact that we are putting safety over</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.900" end="01:00:52.450" style="s2">productivity is actually the best</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.119" end="01:00:54.849" style="s2">feature of our humanity</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.450" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">to emerge against our basest</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.849" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">evolutionary instincts yes we could take</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:02.230" style="s2">advantage of this crisis but we</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:04.750" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t I don&#39;t think that the analogy</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.230" end="01:01:06.070" style="s2">to the trout the salmon that risks a new</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.750" end="01:01:08.520" style="s2">stream rather than playing it safe is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.070" end="01:01:11.650" style="s2">quite right here I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.520" end="01:01:13.900" style="s2">productivity is the Explorer mode salmon</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.650" end="01:01:15.400" style="s2">that goes up and potentially founds a</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.900" end="01:01:17.910" style="s2">new population but may be at risk of</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.400" end="01:01:21.490" style="s2">dying and leaving no offspring at all</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.910" end="01:01:24.490" style="s2">there there are two distinct questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.490" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">here that I think are slightly falsely</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.490" end="01:01:30.730" style="s2">analogized okay all right Adam asks any</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:32.200" style="s2">chance you guys would ever do an episode</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.730" end="01:01:33.820" style="s2">on the politics of the disease for</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.200" end="01:01:35.650" style="s2">example many niche substrates of</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.820" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">anti-democracy personalities are hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.650" end="01:01:39.550" style="s2">for extreme change appreciate you guys</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a great question and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.550" end="01:01:45.390" style="s2">think this is it&#39;s sort of next level</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:47.829" style="s2">but how this is interacting with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.390" end="01:01:50.140" style="s2">political structure the various</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.829" end="01:01:52.270" style="s2">strategies is a fascinating question and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.140" end="01:01:53.829" style="s2">it&#39;s one we have to wrap our minds</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.270" end="01:01:55.810" style="s2">around or it&#39;s going to get the better</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.829" end="01:01:57.099" style="s2">of us so yeah it&#39;s a good topic and we</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.810" end="01:01:59.980" style="s2">should figure out how to integrate it</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.099" end="01:02:02.260" style="s2">hmmm my friend doesn&#39;t get the common</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.980" end="01:02:03.190" style="s2">flu vaccine because he they hear things</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.260" end="01:02:05.380" style="s2">like it&#39;s not a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.190" end="01:02:07.720" style="s2">effective how can I help convince them</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.380" end="01:02:11.260" style="s2">it is still worthwhile and disambiguate</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.720" end="01:02:12.690" style="s2">from something like kovat 19 I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.260" end="01:02:14.650" style="s2">sure what the second part of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.690" end="01:02:16.210" style="s2">disambiguate from something like open 19</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.650" end="01:02:19.510" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure exactly how that play is in</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.210" end="01:02:21.819" style="s2">but you know the question the question</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.510" end="01:02:24.790" style="s2">assumes that everyone should be getting</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.819" end="01:02:28.119" style="s2">the common flu vaccine and you know we</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.790" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">have a we have a more nuanced to take on</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.119" end="01:02:33.069" style="s2">this you know there are many years when</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">none of us get the flu vaccine I happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.069" end="01:02:37.329" style="s2">to have this year the only one in our</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:39.250" style="s2">family who did and you know got very</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.329" end="01:02:42.790" style="s2">sick from Kovan 19 probably no</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.250" end="01:02:44.170" style="s2">relationship but who knows the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.790" end="01:02:45.369" style="s2">you don&#39;t take a vaccine because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.170" end="01:02:47.859" style="s2">not a hundred percent effective is</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.369" end="01:02:53.530" style="s2">obviously a crap argument that just that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.859" end="01:02:56.020" style="s2">makes no sense the thing about the flu</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.530" end="01:02:58.300" style="s2">vaccine that is tricky is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.020" end="01:03:00.940" style="s2">variably effective from year to year and</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.300" end="01:03:02.770" style="s2">no one can Bank accurate predictions</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.940" end="01:03:04.599" style="s2">when you are expected to be taking the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.770" end="01:03:05.990" style="s2">vaccine how effective it will be that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.599" end="01:03:08.600" style="s2">year it&#39;s it&#39;s a quest</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.990" end="01:03:11.510" style="s2">of how good was the prediction of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.600" end="01:03:13.400" style="s2">public health people in guessing which</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.510" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">flu strains were going to be most</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.400" end="01:03:19.430" style="s2">dominant in the population this year so</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:24.080" style="s2">you know not a hundred percent effective</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.430" end="01:03:26.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t a good argument it&#39;s I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.080" end="01:03:27.650" style="s2">you add something here yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.480" end="01:03:29.090" style="s2">tough call</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.650" end="01:03:32.180" style="s2">the idea that it&#39;s not a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.090" end="01:03:34.970" style="s2">act effective is not a good argument</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.180" end="01:03:37.850" style="s2">against it there is a individual versus</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.970" end="01:03:42.440" style="s2">population level question about costs</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.850" end="01:03:44.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about how much we</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.440" end="01:03:48.140" style="s2">know about what the downside of routine</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.450" end="01:03:49.850" style="s2">vaccination is and I actually think this</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.140" end="01:03:51.920" style="s2">is a complicated question on everybody</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.850" end="01:03:57.920" style="s2">in in which most people think they know</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.920" end="01:04:00.170" style="s2">more than they actually do know so how</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.920" end="01:04:02.300" style="s2">do you convince your friend first of all</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.170" end="01:04:05.410" style="s2">you would want to establish that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.300" end="01:04:07.490" style="s2">understood much better than they did and</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.410" end="01:04:10.310" style="s2">then you would want to know something</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.490" end="01:04:13.520" style="s2">about about downsides that I think we</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.310" end="01:04:15.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah what is there besides</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.520" end="01:04:17.630" style="s2">kovat 19 that could get us as bad or</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.500" end="01:04:20.140" style="s2">worse are you prepared for any of those</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.630" end="01:04:23.180" style="s2">could you make a list of 10 most wanted</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.140" end="01:04:24.770" style="s2">wonder if you&#39;re talking about pathogens</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.180" end="01:04:26.510" style="s2">in particular or you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.770" end="01:04:29.210" style="s2">across-the-board existential threat and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.510" end="01:04:31.160" style="s2">such there are there are many things we</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.210" end="01:04:35.300" style="s2">could guess most of them we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.160" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">names for yet over in the the pathogen</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.300" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">space yeah I mean it&#39;s sort of a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:46.670" style="s2">difficult question to answer because</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:49.700" style="s2">evolution is so darn creative that it</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.670" end="01:04:52.730" style="s2">can have generated all manner of Horrors</p>

<p begin="01:04:55.700" end="01:05:02.270" style="s2">but let&#39;s just say as bad as this is an</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.770" end="01:05:05.660" style="s2">awful lot of people seem to get it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.270" end="01:05:08.750" style="s2">have no symptoms which means it could be</p>

<p begin="01:05:08.750" end="01:05:14.800" style="s2">anything really interesting at all</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.800" end="01:05:16.360" style="s2">yeah okay do you predict far-right</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.800" end="01:05:18.220" style="s2">politics will be supercharged in</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.360" end="01:05:19.810" style="s2">countries most affected by Koba 19</p>

<p begin="01:05:22.300" end="01:05:28.920" style="s2">yeah really interesting and so this the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.710" end="01:05:31.180" style="s2">the contingent part of the question is</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.920" end="01:05:33.370" style="s2">or the assumption and the question which</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.180" end="01:05:36.250" style="s2">is true as far as we know is that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.370" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">right that conservatives tend to be more</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.250" end="01:05:45.190" style="s2">sensitive to to tend to respond in</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">greater degree to disgusting things and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.190" end="01:05:50.920" style="s2">this has been repeated several times I</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:52.390" style="s2">think in the research I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.920" end="01:05:56.020" style="s2">interesting hypothesis I hadn&#39;t occurred</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.390" end="01:05:57.550" style="s2">to me I guess there&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.020" end="01:06:00.100" style="s2">whether or not this is viewed as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.550" end="01:06:02.410" style="s2">disgusting disease you know it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.100" end="01:06:04.630" style="s2">stomach bug it&#39;s not a GI bug which</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.410" end="01:06:07.240" style="s2">tends to evoke disgust response yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.630" end="01:06:09.190" style="s2">coughing does not tend to evoke disgust</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.240" end="01:06:10.600" style="s2">in the same way obviously being hooked</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.190" end="01:06:12.130" style="s2">up to ventilators and respirators and</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.600" end="01:06:15.430" style="s2">such you know people very ill in</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.130" end="01:06:17.530" style="s2">hospital can invoke can provoke the</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.430" end="01:06:20.890" style="s2">disgust response but the disease itself</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.530" end="01:06:22.990" style="s2">is less disgusting I think that many</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.890" end="01:06:25.630" style="s2">yeah I could also see it going the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.990" end="01:06:29.770" style="s2">way because since there are very few</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.630" end="01:06:32.710" style="s2">solutions at the individual or small</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.770" end="01:06:37.090" style="s2">group level here this was going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.710" end="01:06:40.450" style="s2">reveal the necessity of of properly</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.090" end="01:06:42.550" style="s2">functioning governance and that could</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.450" end="01:06:45.880" style="s2">take us to the left and I hope if it</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.550" end="01:06:50.280" style="s2">takes us to the left it takes us to a a</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.880" end="01:06:52.350" style="s2">new and better left rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.280" end="01:07:02.080" style="s2">backward-looking version of</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.350" end="01:07:03.880" style="s2">progressivism yeah okay okay yeah why</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.080" end="01:07:05.980" style="s2">why didn&#39;t I take your name yeah why</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.880" end="01:07:08.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t you take yeah said said with</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.980" end="01:07:11.760" style="s2">affection I think I more affection for</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.590" end="01:07:14.290" style="s2">you than me though okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.760" end="01:07:15.610" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna see I&#39;ve seen a version of</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.290" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">this question I started seeing a version</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.610" end="01:07:21.220" style="s2">of this question after you broke into</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:23.470" style="s2">the public eye when evergreen blew up</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.220" end="01:07:26.320" style="s2">and you were on Ruben and then on</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.470" end="01:07:28.690" style="s2">Tucker Carlson and such and the few</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.320" end="01:07:31.060" style="s2">people I saw it from its it struck me as</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.690" end="01:07:34.390" style="s2">very very right-wing and regressive and</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.060" end="01:07:37.630" style="s2">pre-modern and you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.390" end="01:07:41.950" style="s2">a lot behind the rules and culture</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.630" end="01:07:43.840" style="s2">around who when you know when hetero</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.950" end="01:07:45.640" style="s2">couples get together and make families</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.840" end="01:07:47.740" style="s2">what what the rules are where do you</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.640" end="01:07:49.930" style="s2">move it&#39;s a question of locality are you</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.740" end="01:07:51.640" style="s2">matrilocal do you move to the wives the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.930" end="01:07:53.110" style="s2">wife&#39;s home or village are you</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.640" end="01:07:55.960" style="s2">patrilocal you move to their husbands</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.110" end="01:07:58.480" style="s2">home village are you matrilineal and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.960" end="01:08:00.310" style="s2">tend to track families through the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.480" end="01:08:01.480" style="s2">woman and in those cases you would tend</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.310" end="01:08:03.340" style="s2">to track the woman&#39;s name where your</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.480" end="01:08:05.460" style="s2">patrilineal you tend to take the man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.340" end="01:08:08.950" style="s2">name who tends to have the power</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.460" end="01:08:11.950" style="s2">matriarchal versus patriarchal all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.950" end="01:08:16.150" style="s2">these are good solid anthropological</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.950" end="01:08:18.730" style="s2">ways of tracking how power and name and</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.150" end="01:08:21.910" style="s2">resources and people move through time</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.730" end="01:08:26.170" style="s2">and space and we live at a moment that</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.910" end="01:08:28.870" style="s2">is in which many of the historical ways</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.170" end="01:08:30.580" style="s2">in which women actually haven&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.870" end="01:08:33.940" style="s2">ability to live to their full potential</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.580" end="01:08:36.670" style="s2">are breaking down it&#39;s good but what it</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.940" end="01:08:37.990" style="s2">means is that some of the systems that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.670" end="01:08:41.260" style="s2">were kind of functional are also</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.990" end="01:08:43.480" style="s2">breaking down so it was certainly easier</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.260" end="01:08:45.880" style="s2">to track families when everyone in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.480" end="01:08:47.800" style="s2">family had the same last name and here I</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.880" end="01:08:49.990" style="s2">live in a house with the three people I</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.800" end="01:08:51.220" style="s2">love the most in the world and three of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.990" end="01:08:52.600" style="s2">them have the same last name and I have</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.220" end="01:08:57.070" style="s2">a different last name and then a bus are</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.600" end="01:09:00.460" style="s2">confused but it is it is occasionally</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.070" end="01:09:03.460" style="s2">confusing out in the world and yet I</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.460" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">inherited my father&#39;s last name and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.460" end="01:09:08.290" style="s2">was who I had been for 20 you however</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:11.380" style="s2">old we were when we got married 28 29</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.290" end="01:09:14.470" style="s2">years of my life and the idea of beings</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.380" end="01:09:15.790" style="s2">of having my identity switched from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.470" end="01:09:19.180" style="s2">one that I inherited from my father to</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.790" end="01:09:21.700" style="s2">the one of the man whom I loved and was</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.180" end="01:09:25.720" style="s2">marrying didn&#39;t seem like anything I had</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.700" end="01:09:28.150" style="s2">any interest in doing so does that sort</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.720" end="01:09:30.580" style="s2">of not third way of not fourth wave but</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.150" end="01:09:34.180" style="s2">you know honest feminist approach to</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.580" end="01:09:35.580" style="s2">imagining that women can do can make a</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.180" end="01:09:38.700" style="s2">difference in the world the same way</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.580" end="01:09:42.240" style="s2">men can confuse extant systems it does</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.700" end="01:09:44.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not a perfect solution but you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.240" end="01:09:46.320" style="s2">we never considered hyphenating our</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.010" end="01:09:49.020" style="s2">names that would have been a disaster it</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.320" end="01:09:51.330" style="s2">was just a decision to maintain our</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.020" end="01:09:54.900" style="s2">individual personalities and identities</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.330" end="01:09:57.780" style="s2">while also creating a third one which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.900" end="01:10:01.410" style="s2">the accommodation to make a choker yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.780" end="01:10:03.120" style="s2">my part I&#39;m just you know it matters to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.410" end="01:10:06.210" style="s2">me much more that you do what I say</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.120" end="01:10:08.100" style="s2">oh sure then take my last name so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.210" end="01:10:11.160" style="s2">I got what I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.100" end="01:10:13.620" style="s2">all right is it possible that the theory</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.160" end="01:10:15.390" style="s2">of dogs self domesticating by eating our</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.620" end="01:10:17.960" style="s2">garbage could be related to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.390" end="01:10:20.190" style="s2">that we tend not to share diseases I</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.960" end="01:10:22.920" style="s2">suppose I don&#39;t like this self</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.190" end="01:10:23.490" style="s2">domesticating version of the story at</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.920" end="01:10:25.080" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.490" end="01:10:27.840" style="s2">something happened but self</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.080" end="01:10:30.900" style="s2">domesticating is not it&#39;s not the right</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.840" end="01:10:33.780" style="s2">way to think about it you have more to</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.900" end="01:10:35.310" style="s2">say on that yeah just that it&#39;s it seems</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.780" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">likely that dogs may have been</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.310" end="01:10:40.560" style="s2">domesticated multiple times in which</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:42.360" style="s2">case it is also probably likely that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.560" end="01:10:45.900" style="s2">whatever that domestication event looked</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.360" end="01:10:47.850" style="s2">like it was different in in the various</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.900" end="01:10:49.200" style="s2">cases I would say our dog self</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.850" end="01:10:51.930" style="s2">domesticates every morning every morning</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.200" end="01:10:54.330" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.930" end="01:10:56.250" style="s2">domestication events all right thanks</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.330" end="01:10:57.690" style="s2">for answering my questions you&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.250" end="01:10:59.250" style="s2">me a lot to think about Nate you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.690" end="01:11:02.040" style="s2">welcome</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.250" end="01:11:05.130" style="s2">Jimmy tutos says is there a way to use</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.040" end="01:11:10.290" style="s2">viruses as a way to combat bacteria such</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.130" end="01:11:12.090" style="s2">as MRSA yes where is a delivery for new</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.290" end="01:11:14.370" style="s2">cancer treatments yes yes yes of course</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.090" end="01:11:25.440" style="s2">there are ways harness these things and</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.370" end="01:11:28.590" style="s2">in fact had a bacteriophage lab one of</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.440" end="01:11:32.970" style="s2">the premier bacteriophage labs in the US</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.590" end="01:11:35.250" style="s2">and this cup came from that lab with t4</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.970" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">bacteriophage on it so anyway yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.250" end="01:11:42.170" style="s2">harnessing bacteria in order to get</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:45.150" style="s2">genetic material into cells or to attack</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.170" end="01:11:46.940" style="s2">bacteria is a great idea the Russians</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.150" end="01:11:50.370" style="s2">were way ahead on that</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.940" end="01:11:52.290" style="s2">so yes there is hope down that road are</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.370" end="01:11:53.970" style="s2">we lucky the kovat 19 isn&#39;t as deadly</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.290" end="01:11:55.830" style="s2">and we at least we can build a better</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.970" end="01:11:58.980" style="s2">herd immunity for an even deadlier virus</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.830" end="01:12:01.230" style="s2">to develop we are lucky it isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.980" end="01:12:03.420" style="s2">deadly as it might be but any herd</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.230" end="01:12:05.670" style="s2">immunity that we long-term build against</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.420" end="01:12:08.670" style="s2">cover 19 will not work against any</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.670" end="01:12:11.490" style="s2">deadly virus unless it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.670" end="01:12:14.460" style="s2">that became more virulent but in fact</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.490" end="01:12:15.990" style="s2">what we see I think always although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.460" end="01:12:17.550" style="s2">not I&#39;m not so certain of that that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.990" end="01:12:20.550" style="s2">not going to say almost always what we</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.550" end="01:12:23.160" style="s2">see almost always is the longer period</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.550" end="01:12:24.600" style="s2">during which a pathogen and a human are</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.160" end="01:12:26.910" style="s2">Co evolving together the less virulent</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.600" end="01:12:31.560" style="s2">the pathogen tends to become rather than</p>
