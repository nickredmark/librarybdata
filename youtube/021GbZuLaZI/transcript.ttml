<p begin="00:00:40.910" end="00:00:45.290" style="s2">so how it&#39;s gonna work is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.879" end="00:00:46.910" style="s2">almost gonna be like a podcast format</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.290" end="00:00:49.850" style="s2">where Andrew and I are just gonna riff</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.910" end="00:00:51.680" style="s2">on the gift economy and if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.850" end="00:00:54.830" style="s2">questions at any time just write in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.680" end="00:00:58.190" style="s2">chat box and then when like a thread of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.830" end="00:00:59.989" style="s2">our just kind of dies down then I might</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.190" end="00:01:01.820" style="s2">take you in to jump in so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.989" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">hot potato with the podcast and you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.820" end="00:01:04.760" style="s2">jump in with your question for Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.199" end="00:01:06.229" style="s2">and then you can have a kind of exchange</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.760" end="00:01:06.830" style="s2">and then I might jump in to get someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.229" end="00:01:08.930" style="s2">else in there</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.830" end="00:01:10.580" style="s2">or it just might be me and Andrew just</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.930" end="00:01:12.590" style="s2">talking for for the whole 60 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.580" end="00:01:15.290" style="s2">there&#39;s no one jumps in so that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.590" end="00:01:18.500" style="s2">of the how today will work</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.290" end="00:01:21.110" style="s2">I guess that being said and your do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.500" end="00:01:22.820" style="s2">have any opening thoughts about today&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:38.470" end="00:01:42.650" style="s2">providing with a gift economy yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.270" end="00:01:49.580" style="s2">would help if I provide I always just</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.650" end="00:01:52.970" style="s2">look at look at around the corner you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.580" end="00:01:54.740" style="s2">can&#39;t help if I provide just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.970" end="00:01:58.060" style="s2">two-minute overview for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.740" end="00:02:00.110" style="s2">not a constant you yeah that&#39;s good okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.060" end="00:02:02.390" style="s2">let me just provide you the thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.110" end="00:02:04.520" style="s2">experiment so it&#39;s nice nice to meet</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.390" end="00:02:09.049" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s lovely to see you today</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.520" end="00:02:12.049" style="s2">hi let&#39;s imagine that we have three</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.049" end="00:02:14.970" style="s2">entities a B and C and the entities</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.049" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">could be persons or they could</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.970" end="00:02:19.140" style="s2">the organization&#39;s are groups so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">just be agnostic about what these</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.140" end="00:02:26.850" style="s2">entities are a B and C in a gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:30.300" style="s2">what could happen is that entity a year</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.850" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">after a could just add a Apple hardness</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.300" end="00:02:38.210" style="s2">give a gift to B B would receive the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:43.610" style="s2">gift wholeheartedly so we so far we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.210" end="00:02:46.110" style="s2">one act and two wholehearted moves now</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.610" end="00:02:47.640" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s key about a gift economy at</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.110" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">least in my experience and they lived in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.640" end="00:02:52.320" style="s2">one for about a decade is that it&#39;s B</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:53.580" style="s2">has no burden there are no debts that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.320" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">are occurring to be just in virtue</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.580" end="00:02:59.930" style="s2">haven&#39;t received a gift from me so yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:02.550" style="s2">son later point could give a gift to C</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.930" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">now be fine and then B would give a gift</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.550" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">wholeheartedly to C and C we&#39;d receive a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:13.890" style="s2">gift to a hard thing or at some later</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:16.050" style="s2">point B could give a gift to a but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.890" end="00:03:17.700" style="s2">not in any way in exchange those are two</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.050" end="00:03:21.270" style="s2">fundamentally different acts that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.700" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">transpired there so you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.270" end="00:03:27.330" style="s2">yourself what is what is actually going</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:29.130" style="s2">on here whereas in a market system you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.330" end="00:03:32.130" style="s2">begin with a sense of separation between</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.130" end="00:03:35.160" style="s2">entities that sense of separation is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.130" end="00:03:36.209" style="s2">perpetuated in a gift economy what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.160" end="00:03:38.520" style="s2">happening if I may put it rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.209" end="00:03:40.400" style="s2">poetically is that you have in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.520" end="00:03:45.270" style="s2">through the set of actions we call</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.400" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">givings and receiving love emerging or</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.270" end="00:03:47.730" style="s2">if I may put it a little bit less</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:50.360" style="s2">poetically you get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.730" end="00:03:50.360" style="s2">entanglement</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.370" end="00:03:56.030" style="s2">so what&#39;s actually going on over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.290" end="00:03:57.860" style="s2">Nylund gave you a few different acts if</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.030" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">you continue to iterate this process so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.860" end="00:04:02.769" style="s2">to speak what you begin to see is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:06.290" style="s2">greater and grander entanglement of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.769" end="00:04:08.470" style="s2">different entities with one another so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.290" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">the aim of a gift economy actually is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.470" end="00:04:14.330" style="s2">you might say or rather poetically the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:20.350" style="s2">full expression of love whereas the aim</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.330" end="00:04:24.370" style="s2">of market transactions is to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.350" end="00:04:27.169" style="s2">separate entities as separate entities</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.370" end="00:04:29.770" style="s2">so that&#39;s just a little starting point</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.169" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">and we can go from there let&#39;s take it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:04:35.660" style="s2">the whole thing about how it&#39;s a your</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:37.430" style="s2">two ears like that that&#39;s love is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.660" end="00:04:39.169" style="s2">expression of love the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.430" end="00:04:40.790" style="s2">I just want to agree with that and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.169" end="00:04:44.120" style="s2">even look not even fully understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.790" end="00:04:46.100" style="s2">yes yes but maybe you can kind of fill</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.120" end="00:04:49.790" style="s2">in some of the details with the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.100" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">there but why is that the case let me</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.790" end="00:04:55.039" style="s2">try to give you a very concrete example</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:57.110" style="s2">let&#39;s suppose something out of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.039" end="00:05:01.539" style="s2">writes to me and gives me a gift of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.110" end="00:05:01.539" style="s2">money I have no idea who this person is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.590" end="00:05:07.010" style="s2">the person is giving the gift in order</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.000" end="00:05:09.169" style="s2">to support the the philosophical life</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.010" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">I&#39;m leading and I could just say thank</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.169" end="00:05:14.270" style="s2">you that&#39;s that but that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:16.190" style="s2">the invitation here the invitation is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.270" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">for me to write back and say how are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.190" end="00:05:19.789" style="s2">doing what&#39;s going on with your life or</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:22.580" style="s2">thank you so much or here&#39;s what my life</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.789" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">is like so it ends up being that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.580" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">particular gift ends up being initiation</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:30.500" style="s2">into the ways in which would become more</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">and more entangled so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.500" end="00:05:37.220" style="s2">wonderful quote from Martin sailings who</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:39.560" style="s2">is a who is an anthropologist I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.220" end="00:05:42.010" style="s2">fundamental essay in the 1960s or so</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.680" end="00:05:58.909" style="s2">almost a direct quote from the book</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.169" end="00:06:00.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a nice instantiation right you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.909" end="00:06:02.310" style="s2">start to realize that what&#39;s happening</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:26.340" style="s2">and it resonates deeply now there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.010" end="00:07:07.530" style="s2">in sort of the right way so any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.490" end="00:07:10.020" style="s2">line of enquiry feels alive for you I</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.530" end="00:07:12.810" style="s2">think we should look at some concrete</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.020" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">cases we could look at the store we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.810" end="00:07:17.910" style="s2">some people on the call who are involved</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:19.350" style="s2">in nonprofits yeah that would be gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.910" end="00:07:19.890" style="s2">be great because I know what mine looks</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.350" end="00:07:22.380" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.890" end="00:07:29.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing it now for about a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.380" end="00:07:30.930" style="s2">decade I&#39;m very clear about but it would</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.340" end="00:07:33.330" style="s2">be interesting to see what was a gift</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:35.460" style="s2">economy actually look like in cases that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.330" end="00:07:37.890" style="s2">are not like the particular life I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.460" end="00:07:40.200" style="s2">leading yeah this does really good okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.890" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">so a few people just came in what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.200" end="00:07:43.650" style="s2">doing we&#39;re just sort of mean and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:45.030" style="s2">having kind of a conversation almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.650" end="00:07:46.590" style="s2">like a podcast conversation but if</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.030" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">you&#39;re inspired to ask a question just</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.590" end="00:07:50.460" style="s2">write in the chat box and if a thread</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:52.260" style="s2">dies down I&#39;ll take you in and then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.460" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">could kind of ask engineer question I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.260" end="00:07:58.920" style="s2">think this is the right right line of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:08:00.140" style="s2">inquiry right now so maybe maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.920" end="00:08:02.700" style="s2">could you said this before the last</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.140" end="00:08:04.260" style="s2">session you&#39;re here at the stoah and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.700" end="00:08:06.900" style="s2">kinda the inspiration of this one I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.260" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">want to seek your counsel about you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.900" end="00:08:10.230" style="s2">like like personally seek your counsel</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.300" style="s2">in such a way that would be beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.230" end="00:08:14.670" style="s2">for others in order how we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.300" end="00:08:16.380" style="s2">use the gift economy idea the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.670" end="00:08:20.700" style="s2">it applied to different kind of domains</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.380" end="00:08:24.050" style="s2">and aspects so maybe you can just do it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.700" end="00:08:26.220" style="s2">like a recap of how you go about your</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.050" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">gift economy and your philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.220" end="00:08:34.490" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:38.970" style="s2">and we can talk about the stoah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.490" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">well okay so they&#39;re you to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.970" end="00:08:44.610" style="s2">there are ranges between 20 and 40</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:51.270" style="s2">people around the world with whom I</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.610" end="00:08:55.290" style="s2">regularly philosophize and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.270" end="00:08:56.790" style="s2">you have to imagine that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.290" end="00:09:02.820" style="s2">involved in two different sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.790" end="00:09:04.950" style="s2">things one is exchange so that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.820" end="00:09:07.710" style="s2">case that the persons coming and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.950" end="00:09:08.730" style="s2">thinking that this is a service and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.710" end="00:09:13.670" style="s2">person is somehow going to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.730" end="00:09:17.190" style="s2">philosophical wisdom in exchange for</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.670" end="00:09:19.410" style="s2">money or vice versa it&#39;s not an exchange</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.190" end="00:09:20.460" style="s2">it&#39;s also not a donation it would take a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.410" end="00:09:21.960" style="s2">while to spell the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.460" end="00:09:25.320" style="s2">what I call a gift and what I call</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.960" end="00:09:27.420" style="s2">donation it&#39;s not a donation in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.320" end="00:09:29.070" style="s2">sense that&#39;s not for example directed at</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.420" end="00:09:32.150" style="s2">some kind of mission in this case the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.070" end="00:09:34.350" style="s2">gift is given to me to support my life</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.150" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s enough for a starting</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.350" end="00:09:40.860" style="s2">point now what happens is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:41.790" style="s2">basically interested in cultivating a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.860" end="00:09:44.460" style="s2">certain kind of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.790" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">relationship with someone so let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.460" end="00:09:46.710" style="s2">that philosophy just to make it very</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:48.930" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.710" end="00:09:51.000" style="s2">so we&#39;re philosophizing in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.930" end="00:09:52.860" style="s2">the last time I probably described it by</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.000" end="00:09:53.480" style="s2">thinking about a certain world that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.860" end="00:09:56.870" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.480" end="00:10:00.540" style="s2">so the philosophizing is its own thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.870" end="00:10:02.280" style="s2">now because I have a body and because my</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.540" end="00:10:04.260" style="s2">wife has a body because the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.280" end="00:10:06.600" style="s2">requires food and other material needs</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.260" end="00:10:10.230" style="s2">to be met there&#39;s another world which</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.600" end="00:10:12.030" style="s2">we&#39;ll call the gift economy the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.230" end="00:10:15.540" style="s2">philosophizing which takes place at a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.030" end="00:10:17.850" style="s2">regular basis is its own fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.540" end="00:10:19.339" style="s2">thing in the gift economy is something</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.850" end="00:10:21.660" style="s2">else entirely</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.339" end="00:10:23.910" style="s2">the reason I continue to spell it out in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.660" end="00:10:26.190" style="s2">this way is that the typical line of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.910" end="00:10:28.470" style="s2">thought is to suggest that two different</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.190" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">things can be compared in such a way as</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.470" end="00:10:32.190" style="s2">to make it seem as if they&#39;re equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.240" end="00:10:34.230" style="s2">but the fundamental understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.190" end="00:10:35.820" style="s2">gift economy is that fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.230" end="00:10:37.160" style="s2">different things are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.820" end="00:10:40.610" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.160" end="00:10:44.360" style="s2">so on a certain basis I can go into this</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.610" end="00:10:46.490" style="s2">in more detail the person will offer a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.360" end="00:10:48.920" style="s2">gift to support and usually a form of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.490" end="00:10:50.779" style="s2">money to support the life that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.920" end="00:10:52.819" style="s2">leading and in aggregate all of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.779" end="00:10:57.439" style="s2">gifts make up what called what I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.819" end="00:10:59.060" style="s2">call live with it then I have questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.439" end="00:11:03.110" style="s2">that ask people at a certain point to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.060" end="00:11:04.819" style="s2">make to make it very clear and plain how</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.110" end="00:11:06.709" style="s2">we&#39;re going to understand money in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.819" end="00:11:09.470" style="s2">relationship but the most basic question</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.709" end="00:11:11.750" style="s2">is this how much are you able to give in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.470" end="00:11:13.950" style="s2">a wholehearted way in order to meet some</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.750" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">material needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.950" end="00:11:17.910" style="s2">and that can always change over time</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:19.860" style="s2">that&#39;s where it gets a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.910" end="00:11:22.200" style="s2">sophisticated if the person does well in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.860" end="00:11:22.950" style="s2">life and wishes to give more that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.200" end="00:11:26.130" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.950" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">if the person is falling on hard times</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.130" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">and it needs to give less that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:35.880" style="s2">fine so it&#39;s a fluid dynamic motion and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:38.400" style="s2">the reason why it&#39;s what Nassim thali</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.880" end="00:11:39.930" style="s2">would call an anti fragile system if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.400" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">want to get into the that language is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.930" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">that there is a sufficient number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:46.770" style="s2">people from different places around the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">world in different industries all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.770" end="00:11:52.020" style="s2">them are giving different amounts so</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:55.140" style="s2">that if one person wishes to leave</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.020" end="00:11:57.690" style="s2">that&#39;s fine it&#39;s still a sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.140" end="00:12:01.110" style="s2">anti fragile system if other people wish</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.690" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">to come that&#39;s fine too so one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.110" end="00:12:04.710" style="s2">say that it speaks in favor of it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:06.030" style="s2">that it differs ostensibly from what</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.710" end="00:12:07.380" style="s2">Gnostic Tolley would call a fragile</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.030" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">system which is that of gainful</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.380" end="00:12:11.870" style="s2">employment and I think I&#39;ll kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:15.750" style="s2">conclude my remarks there</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.870" end="00:12:17.490" style="s2">so I&#39;ve wanting into the weeds of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.750" end="00:12:20.810" style="s2">stoah and how the Stowe is using the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.490" end="00:12:23.520" style="s2">gift economy how we can use it better</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.810" end="00:12:27.300" style="s2">but first the frame I&#39;m using I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.520" end="00:12:29.340" style="s2">viewing the stoah in this project as my</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.300" end="00:12:30.810" style="s2">gift to the world right now do you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.340" end="00:12:31.980" style="s2">that frame to with your philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.810" end="00:12:33.480" style="s2">practice is that that you&#39;re viewing</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.980" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">that this is your gift you&#39;re giving to</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.480" end="00:12:40.890" style="s2">the world yes and no which is a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:43.380" style="s2">quaver quiet</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.890" end="00:12:46.020" style="s2">yes and if we go back to the - let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.380" end="00:12:48.960" style="s2">let&#39;s take this door for example so any</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.020" end="00:12:52.860" style="s2">of these sessions for you you might call</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.960" end="00:12:55.110" style="s2">that the philosophy world so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.860" end="00:12:58.830" style="s2">someone comes on talks about Seneca or</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.110" end="00:13:00.690" style="s2">Cove at 19 and since making all of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.830" end="00:13:04.830" style="s2">where Adam Robert comes on and talks</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.690" end="00:13:07.350" style="s2">about spiritual practice for women etc</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.830" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">etc all of these I would call philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.350" end="00:13:11.430" style="s2">that is a gift but you&#39;d be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:13.260" style="s2">with people because you don&#39;t want them</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.430" end="00:13:16.020" style="s2">to think that the gift of philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.260" end="00:13:19.080" style="s2">comparable to the gift that comes the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.020" end="00:13:20.910" style="s2">form of money or help or whatever yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.080" end="00:13:22.740" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m tend to be very I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.910" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">tend to use the gift to the world quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.740" end="00:13:26.550" style="s2">as frequently anymore because I get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:27.570" style="s2">little bit concerned that people start</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.550" end="00:13:29.370" style="s2">to think oh if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.570" end="00:13:31.350" style="s2">give to the world then I need to give</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.370" end="00:13:33.029" style="s2">you a gift or something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.350" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">so I usually say the philosophy is about</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.029" end="00:13:38.279" style="s2">wisdom on our understanding that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:39.750" style="s2">use this to world dualistic analogy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.279" end="00:13:41.160" style="s2">and that the other one&#39;s about the gift</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.750" end="00:13:44.459" style="s2">which helps to meet the material needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.160" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">of the body so early it&#39;s a gift that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.459" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">meets the material needs it&#39;s a stone if</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.620" end="00:13:50.670" style="s2">you yeah because apartment just wants to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:52.350" style="s2">give this and whatever I&#39;m doing right</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.670" end="00:13:54.620" style="s2">here without like receiving anything I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.350" end="00:13:57.779" style="s2">just want to do this the stoic project</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.620" end="00:13:59.430" style="s2">no I mean what I don&#39;t thing I learned</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.779" end="00:14:01.290" style="s2">is that people today the degree in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.430" end="00:14:03.959" style="s2">spiritual circles talk about having no</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.290" end="00:14:05.639" style="s2">expectations we&#39;ve heard that a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.959" end="00:14:09.149" style="s2">that&#39;s not really true I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.639" end="00:14:10.860" style="s2">that before this session thing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.149" end="00:14:12.779" style="s2">that you need to have no expectations is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.860" end="00:14:14.540" style="s2">that you need to begin to examine the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.779" end="00:14:17.310" style="s2">expectations you have and have fewer</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.540" end="00:14:18.810" style="s2">expectations one expectation I have for</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.310" end="00:14:22.949" style="s2">everyone within my philosophize is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.810" end="00:14:27.269" style="s2">they give something because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.949" end="00:14:30.120" style="s2">actually tried in my life I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.269" end="00:14:34.170" style="s2">tried to philosophize with people and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.120" end="00:14:36.899" style="s2">they don&#39;t there&#39;s no expectation they</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.170" end="00:14:38.279" style="s2">ever give right it doesn&#39;t honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.899" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">mean this is not some kind of neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.279" end="00:14:42.329" style="s2">argument it&#39;s just it&#39;s just there needs</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">to be a typically need to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.329" end="00:14:46.139" style="s2">bit skin in the game someone says thank</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">you that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.139" end="00:14:50.190" style="s2">you know yeah to qualify my my last</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.319" style="s2">statement it wasn&#39;t necessarily tied to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.190" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">the gift economy it sort of like this</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.319" end="00:14:55.829" style="s2">whole project to me is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:56.940" style="s2">reading a really good book and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.829" end="00:14:59.430" style="s2">care if anyone knows I&#39;m reading that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.940" end="00:15:06.269" style="s2">book I just have that desire to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.430" end="00:15:07.860" style="s2">of course yeah so so the Stoll project</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.269" end="00:15:09.380" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll get some I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.860" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">mentioned it to you already</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.380" end="00:15:13.500" style="s2">so the idea here is it&#39;s like a digital</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:16.380" style="s2">campfire where we have kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.500" end="00:15:18.779" style="s2">wisdom gym forming there&#39;s a psycho like</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.380" end="00:15:20.100" style="s2">a psycho technology incubator that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.779" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">people can test out things and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.100" end="00:15:24.389" style="s2">could be porting the wisdom gym and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.260" end="00:15:25.860" style="s2">there&#39;s like sense-making knows where</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.389" end="00:15:28.199" style="s2">people come in and speak like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.860" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">Hall yourself or whoever and then they</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.199" end="00:15:32.279" style="s2">have like these Q&amp;A portions that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:34.740" style="s2">it&#39;s like forming right now and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.279" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">people have been offering or inspired to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.740" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">provide gifts just based off the Lincoln</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:40.920" style="s2">there&#39;s mentioning it the form of money</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:42.209" style="s2">help whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.920" end="00:15:44.100" style="s2">there has not been sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.209" end="00:15:46.250" style="s2">training around it like you have in your</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.100" end="00:15:48.329" style="s2">practice which I&#39;m hoping we can get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.250" end="00:15:51.269" style="s2">but that was what&#39;s interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.329" end="00:15:53.639" style="s2">happening here already to digital</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.269" end="00:15:55.740" style="s2">campfires emerge from this project</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.639" end="00:15:57.480" style="s2">Colin Morris&#39;s who I think you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.740" end="00:15:59.850" style="s2">talked to her talking to he has a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.480" end="00:16:01.010" style="s2">digital dance studio but embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.850" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">he&#39;s basing it off the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.010" end="00:16:07.560" style="s2">Tyson who&#39;s in this chat right now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:09.180" style="s2">doing a freestyle studio where is like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.560" end="00:16:10.949" style="s2">freestyle rap in the form of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.180" end="00:16:13.529" style="s2">like keeping ego in check and as a form</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.949" end="00:16:14.760" style="s2">of like you know being practicing your</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.529" end="00:16:16.500" style="s2">truthfulness muscle in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.760" end="00:16:18.899" style="s2">artistic way and so he started his own</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.500" end="00:16:20.850" style="s2">digital campfire based up the gift</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.899" end="00:16:23.130" style="s2">economy model and so this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.850" end="00:16:24.990" style="s2">is inspiring other people to do similar</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.130" end="00:16:26.670" style="s2">things and so if we can kind of get it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.990" end="00:16:27.959" style="s2">right here at the stoah and it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.670" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">help other people get it right other</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.959" end="00:16:31.230" style="s2">places as well which is I find really</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:32.610" style="s2">cool and that Raven is in the audience</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.230" end="00:16:35.100" style="s2">as well and she&#39;s probably gonna do her</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.610" end="00:16:39.209" style="s2">own thing as with that with the gift</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.100" end="00:16:41.550" style="s2">economy as well so that being said is</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.209" end="00:16:42.839" style="s2">there any before I kind of like ask you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.550" end="00:16:44.130" style="s2">about how to make it more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.839" end="00:16:46.050" style="s2">the framing everything any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.130" end="00:16:47.940" style="s2">thoughts on how the stoic could are</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.050" end="00:16:50.699" style="s2">currently is operating on the gift</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.940" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">economy yeah I was thing about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.699" end="00:16:56.970" style="s2">before our session today and I found</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:16:59.850" style="s2">that I think it may have said this I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.970" end="00:17:02.370" style="s2">mean the last gift economy session that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.850" end="00:17:05.250" style="s2">you have to be really clear about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.370" end="00:17:07.110" style="s2">question you ask people or the earthy</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:10.040" style="s2">prefer the invitation you make right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.110" end="00:17:12.870" style="s2">the invitation I think is it&#39;s too vague</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.040" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">so the the vagueness of the institution</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.870" end="00:17:16.679" style="s2">will be manifested and often in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:18.260" style="s2">vagueness of the responses are</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.679" end="00:17:21.780" style="s2">non-responsive</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.260" end="00:17:27.630" style="s2">if I ask if I if I just ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.780" end="00:17:29.340" style="s2">can you give something just people</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.630" end="00:17:31.169" style="s2">people some would say yes and would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.340" end="00:17:34.470" style="s2">no it wouldn&#39;t be clear what they would</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.169" end="00:17:36.870" style="s2">give and so forth so I like the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.470" end="00:17:39.480" style="s2">about when I&#39;m philosophizing people so</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.870" end="00:17:42.630" style="s2">one of the criteria is to provide an</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.480" end="00:17:44.669" style="s2">answer that&#39;s very plain and clear and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.630" end="00:17:47.460" style="s2">just answer that question so if I ask</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.669" end="00:17:49.559" style="s2">someone how old he or she is that person</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.460" end="00:17:51.780" style="s2">would just need to give the H that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.559" end="00:17:53.980" style="s2">that&#39;s the answer to that question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.780" end="00:17:56.280" style="s2">if I ask the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.980" end="00:17:59.350" style="s2">and what sorts of things do you remember</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.280" end="00:18:01.120" style="s2">from yesterday that&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.350" end="00:18:03.610" style="s2">vague or questions going to present some</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:04.840" style="s2">a little bag here of an answer if I</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.610" end="00:18:06.910" style="s2">asked the person what&#39;s the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:09.160" style="s2">life I would expect that answer to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.910" end="00:18:11.380" style="s2">broader and more abstract less concise</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.160" end="00:18:15.040" style="s2">and so on what I&#39;m trying to illustrate</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.380" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">is that right now the what I would I</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.040" end="00:18:21.610" style="s2">noticed is that a lot of the nonprofit&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:24.490" style="s2">seem to have very unclear articulations</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.610" end="00:18:26.860" style="s2">of what they&#39;re asking from people I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.490" end="00:18:28.150" style="s2">give you an example I went to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.860" end="00:18:30.669" style="s2">garrison Institute which is in upstate</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.150" end="00:18:32.950" style="s2">New York in the fall where I was at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.669" end="00:18:34.780" style="s2">retreat with a spiritual teacher named</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.950" end="00:18:36.790" style="s2">Rupert spire who&#39;s in the invite but</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.780" end="00:18:40.360" style="s2">thought to direct path for those who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.790" end="00:18:42.429" style="s2">interested and as you might imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.360" end="00:18:44.940" style="s2">garrisons to another such places that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.429" end="00:18:48.990" style="s2">have largely been these in-person</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.940" end="00:18:53.020" style="s2">retreats have been struggling mightily</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.990" end="00:18:55.030" style="s2">during covin 19 so they&#39;ve they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.020" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">pivoted to a virtual sanctuary and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.030" end="00:18:58.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve they recently just this morning</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:00.190" style="s2">or asking for donations and again I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.840" end="00:19:02.530" style="s2">argue that donations are slightly</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.190" end="00:19:06.580" style="s2">different from gifts but it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.530" end="00:19:07.990" style="s2">you know someone who is very think has</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.580" end="00:19:10.120" style="s2">been in this space for a while but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.990" end="00:19:12.610" style="s2">still felt as if something was missing</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.120" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">for example I&#39;ve only been there once is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.610" end="00:19:16.179" style="s2">it really going to be the case then</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:18.910" style="s2">likely to be someone who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.179" end="00:19:21.000" style="s2">contribute a donation to support this</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.910" end="00:19:23.559" style="s2">organization the answer is probably not</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.000" end="00:19:27.450" style="s2">so something is gone so and something is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.559" end="00:19:30.220" style="s2">going awry there when you just have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.450" end="00:19:34.570" style="s2">vague invitation sent out to your</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.220" end="00:19:36.730" style="s2">listserv with the view to getting some</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.570" end="00:19:37.900" style="s2">some people to offer donations it feels</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.730" end="00:19:39.730" style="s2">as though there was an opportunity was</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.309" end="00:21:21.539" style="s2">know cuz there&#39;s so much other</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.600" end="00:21:24.330" style="s2">going on but there&#39;s like a dirtiness -</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.539" end="00:21:25.980" style="s2">it feels like kind of being more clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.330" end="00:21:28.230" style="s2">on this it&#39;s almost like I feel like one</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.980" end="00:21:29.909" style="s2">of those those those cam girls who have</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.230" end="00:21:31.230" style="s2">like a Amazon wishlist like I mean like</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.809" end="00:21:39.000" style="s2">it but I like the idea this this came to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.010" end="00:21:41.309" style="s2">mind when you&#39;re talking just maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.000" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">having it on the gift economy webpage at</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.309" end="00:21:45.510" style="s2">the stoah having clear like baby</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">basically stating what kind of life I</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.510" end="00:21:49.169" style="s2">want or what kind of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:51.230" style="s2">livelihood I need or whoever and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.169" end="00:21:55.669" style="s2">having questions that could help people</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.230" end="00:22:00.210" style="s2">inform them on what gifts to give yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.669" end="00:22:01.830" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not dirty people</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.210" end="00:22:04.710" style="s2">want to know I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.830" end="00:22:08.010" style="s2">that might illustrate the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.710" end="00:22:09.659" style="s2">being in this space if you ever go to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.010" end="00:22:12.120" style="s2">Buddhist retreat or some other place</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.659" end="00:22:14.330" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s talk about Donna which</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.120" end="00:22:18.419" style="s2">was the Buddhist term for generosity or</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.330" end="00:22:20.070" style="s2">gift and at some places such as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.419" end="00:22:21.820" style="s2">Goenka of a Boston retreat</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.070" end="00:22:23.140" style="s2">there is no</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.820" end="00:22:24.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a very clumsy how they have it set</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.140" end="00:22:25.780" style="s2">it up and given that I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.220" end="00:22:30.160" style="s2">thinking about this for a while but</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.780" end="00:22:31.510" style="s2">they&#39;ll basically say there are a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.160" end="00:22:35.410" style="s2">things that are mistaken but the one is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.510" end="00:22:38.110" style="s2">just give give out of Donna based on how</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.410" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">much you&#39;ve benefited so no no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.110" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s egoistic and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:44.680" style="s2">that that&#39;s not the right creating but</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:46.560" style="s2">even if you didn&#39;t grant that you still</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.680" end="00:22:49.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know at the end of ten day retreat</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.560" end="00:22:52.900" style="s2">you have nothing to you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.330" end="00:22:55.780" style="s2">the organization needs you don&#39;t you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.900" end="00:22:58.570" style="s2">no idea of no way to kind of set some</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.780" end="00:23:01.270" style="s2">kind of coordinates or guidelines even</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.570" end="00:23:03.070" style="s2">if you even if you wanted to give which</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.270" end="00:23:05.130" style="s2">is pretty reasonable after ten days of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.070" end="00:23:08.350" style="s2">receiving throughout the quarter</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.130" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">eautiful retreat you&#39;re just not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.350" end="00:23:12.280" style="s2">not all clear and the unclarity reveals</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:14.850" style="s2">itself from the fact that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.280" end="00:23:17.080" style="s2">really know what appropriate responses</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.850" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">so I&#39;ve basically been in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.080" end="00:23:20.500" style="s2">number of times and other people I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:22.540" style="s2">spoken with have been in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.500" end="00:23:25.570" style="s2">number of times it&#39;s very refreshing</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.540" end="00:23:27.940" style="s2">there for it to have some clarity oh you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.570" end="00:23:30.910" style="s2">need shoes okay well I think I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.940" end="00:23:32.680" style="s2">provide shoes here are some shoes oh you</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.910" end="00:23:34.810" style="s2">need firewood you&#39;re living in rural</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.680" end="00:23:37.000" style="s2">Appalachia okay well I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.810" end="00:23:38.980" style="s2">provide you the firewood I can see how</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.000" end="00:23:41.620" style="s2">that would function or we fill out your</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.980" end="00:23:43.390" style="s2">life so I think we need to turn it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.620" end="00:23:47.470" style="s2">around and say that it&#39;s it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.390" end="00:23:50.710" style="s2">kind of gross or weird to be specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.470" end="00:23:52.420" style="s2">with people if someone wants to be if</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.710" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">Philip wants to be generous then someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.420" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">wants to know there&#39;s a form in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.040" end="00:23:57.100" style="s2">that generosity can manifest itself and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:24:00.310" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to be a wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.100" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">received if I just give something</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.310" end="00:24:04.690" style="s2">vaguely to you or if I get something out</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:05.770" style="s2">of some abstract sense I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.690" end="00:24:09.550" style="s2">whether you&#39;re going to really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.770" end="00:24:11.860" style="s2">going to land yeah I like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.550" end="00:24:13.030" style="s2">the expectation of giving you know we</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.860" end="00:24:14.950" style="s2">know what this is like to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.030" end="00:24:16.360" style="s2">simple example when we have birthdays</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.950" end="00:24:17.500" style="s2">and your parents give you a kiss you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.360" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">realize the extent to which they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.500" end="00:24:24.790" style="s2">understand to you right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.620" style="s2">certain sense which I you didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.790" end="00:24:28.420" style="s2">what it was that I really needed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.620" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">yeah I think you and I will have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.420" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.240" end="00:24:38.050" style="s2">ya know that&#39;s when I&#39;m kind of called</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.700" end="00:24:39.730" style="s2">that out to kind of that feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.050" end="00:24:42.310" style="s2">dirtiness I had and then just</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.730" end="00:24:43.870" style="s2">articulating a potential Avenue our way</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.310" end="00:24:47.590" style="s2">to move forward it just disappeared too</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.870" end="00:24:50.410" style="s2">so I think as the next steps just sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.590" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">of like having maybe what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.410" end="00:24:55.210" style="s2">about this so and maybe you can review</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">the draft like I crate like like a blurb</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.210" end="00:24:59.710" style="s2">of like what as of this moment what kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:01.300" style="s2">of life I would like or what kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.710" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">know how I would like my livelihood to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.300" end="00:25:05.890" style="s2">be supported and what letter I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:09.130" style="s2">require for that and then just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.890" end="00:25:11.590" style="s2">ask some questions like wisely design</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.130" end="00:25:13.900" style="s2">questions in order to inform people how</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.590" end="00:25:15.640" style="s2">to provide a gift and then the actual</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.900" end="00:25:18.670" style="s2">means of how to provide it either PayPal</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.640" end="00:25:21.670" style="s2">or whatever or help or support yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.670" end="00:25:24.220" style="s2">then I would say that&#39;s good that kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.670" end="00:25:26.020" style="s2">of to replace that one is it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.220" end="00:25:28.360" style="s2">it&#39;s almost always wise not to put too</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.020" end="00:25:32.200" style="s2">many questions on there the question is</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.360" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">really meant to be it&#39;s a very Michi and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.200" end="00:25:36.610" style="s2">it kind of it channels the dionyza</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:39.070" style="s2">energy into a form to an Apollonian form</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.610" end="00:25:41.650" style="s2">right so if you have 20 questions it</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.070" end="00:25:43.630" style="s2">shows a kind of anxiety you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.650" end="00:25:45.970" style="s2">want that just a few nice questions</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.970" end="00:25:52.900" style="s2">to what really matters yes yes as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.470" end="00:25:54.340" style="s2">so coming up to mind is um there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:55.900" style="s2">part of those thought oh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.340" end="00:25:58.300" style="s2">nonprofit that kind of organizes all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:26:00.790" style="s2">stoical groups in the world and there</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.300" end="00:26:02.530" style="s2">was tension there between me and um when</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.790" end="00:26:04.090" style="s2">I launched a stole a project they</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.530" end="00:26:05.710" style="s2">thought like was this kind of directed</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.090" end="00:26:07.090" style="s2">with the profit motive is he like she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.710" end="00:26:09.250" style="s2">trying to be a hustler and stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.090" end="00:26:10.450" style="s2">there was like a disconnect there but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.250" end="00:26:13.420" style="s2">chatted with one of the board members</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.450" end="00:26:13.750" style="s2">was I&#39;m on the board I&#39;m on the board as</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.270" end="00:26:19.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.500" end="00:26:22.090" style="s2">important to be clear about all that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:24.160" style="s2">upfront with kind of like humility</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.090" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2">because it will disabuse people of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.160" end="00:26:27.300" style="s2">having these ideas that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.570" end="00:26:33.460" style="s2">something that you&#39;re actually not doing</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.820" end="00:27:36.160" style="s2">running this because I&#39;m just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:39.790" style="s2">why you&#39;re saying supporting your</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.160" end="00:27:42.970" style="s2">lifestyle and your income from what</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.970" end="00:27:50.050" style="s2">help you alone yeah so I&#39;m a trainer at</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.710" end="00:27:52.420" style="s2">Dale Carnegie Training it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.050" end="00:27:54.780" style="s2">interpersonal kind of training company</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.420" end="00:27:56.410" style="s2">has been around for hundred years and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.780" end="00:27:57.610" style="s2">they&#39;re probably gonna go out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.410" end="00:27:59.710" style="s2">business because all their bread and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.610" end="00:28:02.650" style="s2">butter is in person training so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.710" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2">doing any training right now and my wife</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.650" end="00:28:05.920" style="s2">works full-time remotely so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.600" end="00:28:08.410" style="s2">one night we have a bunch of cash and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.920" end="00:28:11.110" style="s2">savings so I&#39;m not worried about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.410" end="00:28:13.570" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an option there&#39;s a fork</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.110" end="00:28:16.270" style="s2">in the road do I find like some Normie</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.570" end="00:28:17.920" style="s2">job you know like that I couldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.270" end="00:28:19.990" style="s2">from remote where am I gonna go full</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.920" end="00:28:21.280" style="s2">throttle with this thing and I decided</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.990" end="00:28:23.830" style="s2">to go full throttle with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.280" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">maybe about a month ago alright I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.830" end="00:28:26.050" style="s2">have a choice really I&#39;m just following</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:29.710" style="s2">the Damon I&#39;m just going for it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.050" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">and and people have been gifting me</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.710" end="00:28:34.420" style="s2">money not enough to support a livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:36.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s substantial and it&#39;s allowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.420" end="00:28:38.500" style="s2">me to buy things to support the project</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.340" end="00:28:40.030" style="s2">and whatnot so I think I&#39;m gonna make a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.500" end="00:28:41.320" style="s2">run for this and I want to do what</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.030" end="00:28:43.150" style="s2">Andrew does with his philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.320" end="00:28:44.890" style="s2">practice I want to support my live of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.150" end="00:28:48.070" style="s2">and ideally Camille&#39;s live of it my wife</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.890" end="00:28:51.170" style="s2">on the gift economy okay yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.070" end="00:28:53.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve read some of your blog posts</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.170" end="00:28:56.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve read a little bit about this store</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.780" end="00:28:59.300" style="s2">background this is only my third session</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.690" end="00:29:02.630" style="s2">so I don&#39;t really know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.300" end="00:29:04.820" style="s2">coming from financially and also I guess</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.630" end="00:29:09.010" style="s2">the philosophical ethos at your turn and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.820" end="00:29:12.380" style="s2">run the whole project with so far</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.010" end="00:29:14.570" style="s2">because both first things I think and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.380" end="00:29:19.670" style="s2">what you&#39;ve just said really you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.570" end="00:29:21.320" style="s2">gonna change how you have to word I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.670" end="00:29:23.390" style="s2">I personally wouldn&#39;t you use its own</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.320" end="00:29:27.650" style="s2">gift economy but I understand why it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.390" end="00:29:29.030" style="s2">used the way that you approach people</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.650" end="00:29:34.760" style="s2">for money</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.030" end="00:29:36.830" style="s2">I mean I&#39;d most self and I well I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.760" end="00:29:39.970" style="s2">a student but I have been producing</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:43.910" style="s2">music for about five or six years and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.970" end="00:29:48.160" style="s2">DJing and I&#39;ve made like zero dollars</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.910" end="00:29:52.430" style="s2">from it because I just you there as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.160" end="00:29:57.830" style="s2">project of passion but I&#39;m not having to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.430" end="00:29:59.750" style="s2">support a wife and I&#39;m not having to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.830" end="00:30:04.970" style="s2">not in your situation so it is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.750" end="00:30:08.360" style="s2">different the questions I think Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.970" end="00:30:13.960" style="s2">was saying about asking people that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.360" end="00:30:17.750" style="s2">saying like if you have something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.960" end="00:30:20.780" style="s2">do you feel you enjoy what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.750" end="00:30:23.660" style="s2">here at this door project maybe consider</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.780" end="00:30:28.030" style="s2">giving a gift that lets like stage one</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.660" end="00:30:30.830" style="s2">of asking for maybe arms then stage two</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.030" end="00:30:33.320" style="s2">you start asking the more specific</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.830" end="00:30:37.040" style="s2">questions like would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.320" end="00:30:39.590" style="s2">continue learning with us it would</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.040" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">really help us out and help my life out</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.590" end="00:30:46.070" style="s2">if you could consider donating be more</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:48.980" style="s2">concrete about using the word donate</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.070" end="00:30:52.820" style="s2">rather than gift or something will vague</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.980" end="00:30:54.110" style="s2">that make sense I want to I would say</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.820" end="00:30:55.340" style="s2">something I want to bounce it to Andrea</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.110" end="00:30:59.480" style="s2">I&#39;m curious I think he has more wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.340" end="00:31:01.190" style="s2">here than I do like one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.480" end="00:31:03.800" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;m in a lucky grateful position</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.190" end="00:31:04.999" style="s2">I&#39;m not like stressed to get money your</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.800" end="00:31:07.459" style="s2">support live with my wife</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.999" end="00:31:09.489" style="s2">pretty good money and again I could I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.459" end="00:31:12.079" style="s2">could jump back into the old game a</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.489" end="00:31:13.839" style="s2">world right now if I wanted to with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.079" end="00:31:16.549" style="s2">little bit of a hustle I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.839" end="00:31:18.049" style="s2">and I also can seek out probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.549" end="00:31:20.269" style="s2">investors for this project at this point</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.049" end="00:31:22.219" style="s2">I know a lot of rich people who were</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.269" end="00:31:24.349" style="s2">digging this project I&#39;m friends looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.219" end="00:31:25.969" style="s2">Angie Strickler from co-founder of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.349" end="00:31:27.139" style="s2">Kickstarter and I probably couldn&#39;t seek</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.969" end="00:31:28.909" style="s2">his wisdom how to get offense to</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.139" end="00:31:31.399" style="s2">investors for this and he&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.909" end="00:31:34.189" style="s2">gonna be in the wisdom gym as well but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.399" end="00:31:35.419" style="s2">want to go down that path yet and I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.189" end="00:31:37.549" style="s2">bring a lot of attention this project I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.419" end="00:31:39.439" style="s2">go on a podcast circuit got all</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.549" end="00:31:41.059" style="s2">this North egoic noise coming this way I</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.439" end="00:31:43.549" style="s2">don&#39;t want that yet either</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.059" end="00:31:46.279" style="s2">I really resonate with what Andrews</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.549" end="00:31:47.599" style="s2">doing and it feels pure and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.279" end="00:31:48.109" style="s2">run with that at least for the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.599" end="00:31:50.029" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.109" end="00:31:53.229" style="s2">so I think that I&#39;ll pass it over to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.029" end="00:31:56.229" style="s2">Andrew see if he has anything out here</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.229" end="00:31:56.229" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.769" end="00:32:02.119" style="s2">so it&#39;d take a little while to parse a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.359" end="00:32:04.609" style="s2">lot of these terms but let&#39;s come back</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.119" end="00:32:07.789" style="s2">to the first phrasing if you enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.609" end="00:32:13.429" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here consider giving or</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.789" end="00:32:14.839" style="s2">donating so that that&#39;s not quite that</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.429" end="00:32:16.189" style="s2">would be in the spirit of a donation you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.839" end="00:32:23.179" style="s2">might say but not in the spirit of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.189" end="00:32:24.709" style="s2">gift the reason is that it doesn&#39;t I try</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.179" end="00:32:27.139" style="s2">to give you an example last time let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.709" end="00:32:29.499" style="s2">take the example of a church let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.590" end="00:35:26.450" style="s2">for the sake of those who come to it but</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.070" end="00:35:27.950" style="s2">not for the sake of something else if</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.450" end="00:35:30.290" style="s2">anything comes from the stoah then it</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.950" end="00:35:33.990" style="s2">comes as a kind of epiphenomena or a</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.290" end="00:35:36.970" style="s2">byproduct or something else in fire</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.990" end="00:35:39.070" style="s2">my hunch and I&#39;m not been to Evaristo</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.339" end="00:35:45.780" style="s2">again if they are for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.900" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">something they can&#39;t put their words on</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.780" end="00:35:49.599" style="s2">but for the sake of something that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:51.670" style="s2">definitely here they feels it there the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.599" end="00:35:54.310" style="s2">right place it&#39;s a bit like finding your</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.310" end="00:35:58.869" style="s2">then the gift comes to support having</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.060" end="00:36:14.589" style="s2">one cause or some kind of propositional</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.670" end="00:36:16.839" style="s2">statement of a cause because I&#39;m trying</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.839" end="00:36:21.720" style="s2">and and I&#39;m drawn to it and I think</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.900" end="00:36:39.910" style="s2">different lenses and I don&#39;t think there</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">is a right answer right now when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.910" end="00:36:44.859" style="s2">a discovery process here and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">one of the things that you brought up</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.859" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">around church is that while I might be</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.940" end="00:39:44.860" style="s2">terms of giving and receiving on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.890" end="00:39:47.410" style="s2">platform so that&#39;s kind of the high</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.860" end="00:39:49.930" style="s2">level in a nutshell and the idea is gift</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.490" end="00:40:07.090" style="s2">see but more as a supplement an</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.940" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">alternative and eventually you know it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.090" end="00:40:12.660" style="s2">could be that it it becomes the leading</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.040" end="00:41:03.520" style="s2">into this conversation he knows I given</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.900" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">a talk about the gift economy a few</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.520" end="00:41:08.290" style="s2">years ago at a conference or rather like</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.090" style="s2">a retreat that we were at and so he</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.290" end="00:41:13.840" style="s2">knows that I&#39;m I&#39;ve been pushing this</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.090" end="00:41:18.790" style="s2">concept a lot and I&#39;ll finish in just</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.840" end="00:41:20.530" style="s2">the next thirty seconds which is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.790" end="00:41:22.330" style="s2">gone back and forth in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.530" end="00:41:24.930" style="s2">what are my motivations to doing gift</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.330" end="00:41:27.190" style="s2">economy and why am i doing gating and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.930" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">there is an aspect of it where I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.190" end="00:41:30.700" style="s2">like I&#39;m sick and tired of the money</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:33.910" style="s2">system and I want to build this</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.700" end="00:41:35.470" style="s2">system that changes the game and what</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.910" end="00:41:38.109" style="s2">I&#39;m finding though whenever I have that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.470" end="00:41:41.590" style="s2">mindset it&#39;s like wait hold on like let</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.109" end="00:41:43.840" style="s2">me first get my solidified systems at</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.590" end="00:41:47.080" style="s2">least at some level on the in the muggle</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.840" end="00:41:49.540" style="s2">world and the current paradigm economics</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.080" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">and let me really show up to the gift</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.540" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">economy conversation and this effort</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:58.420" style="s2">from an empowered space and not from a</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:42:00.490" style="s2">place of neediness and so not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.420" end="00:42:03.160" style="s2">fill that void with this platform but</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.490" end="00:42:05.770" style="s2">more so see my efforts in the gift</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.160" end="00:42:08.220" style="s2">economy as a gift like I&#39;m here as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.770" end="00:42:12.310" style="s2">gift or as somebody that&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.220" end="00:42:13.720" style="s2">forward to society into the you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.310" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">creating of a new</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.720" end="00:42:17.500" style="s2">whole new beautiful world as Charles</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:20.280" style="s2">Eisenstein Stein would say you know so</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.500" end="00:42:23.140" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s why I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.280" end="00:42:25.060" style="s2">cool well that&#39;s some glad you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.140" end="00:42:28.380" style="s2">appreciate that yeah thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.060" end="00:42:28.380" style="s2">for having this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.880" end="00:42:42.070" style="s2">Andrew was anything alive for you I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:43.750" style="s2">throw out something for Andrew and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.070" end="00:42:46.150" style="s2">just wondering how you think of the so</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.750" end="00:42:48.040" style="s2">called trading economy which I also hear</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.150" end="00:42:51.160" style="s2">about where people want to just trade</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.040" end="00:42:54.280" style="s2">specific trade transactions versus the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.160" end="00:42:57.220" style="s2">gift economy and as distant as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.280" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">example I&#39;m a coach later in life having</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.220" end="00:43:00.190" style="s2">been an attorney earlier in life and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:01.660" style="s2">they&#39;re you know there&#39;s a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.190" end="00:43:04.119" style="s2">that goes on in those worlds where</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.660" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a I&#39;ll trade you this service</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.119" end="00:43:08.500" style="s2">for that service and maybe people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.670" end="00:43:11.770" style="s2">even looking at I&#39;ll trade you coaching</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.500" end="00:43:13.980" style="s2">for vegetables or you know other</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.770" end="00:43:17.170" style="s2">materials like that that&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.980" end="00:43:18.550" style="s2">specific transaction so I don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.170" end="00:43:20.950" style="s2">guessing you don&#39;t think of that as so</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.550" end="00:43:22.300" style="s2">much a gift as you use it and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.950" end="00:43:23.770" style="s2">there&#39;s also the issue and something</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.300" end="00:43:26.619" style="s2">like coaching as you know where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.770" end="00:43:28.300" style="s2">a downside to being pro bono because</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.619" end="00:43:31.420" style="s2">there&#39;s no skin in the game so that adds</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.300" end="00:43:33.730" style="s2">another dimension so do you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.420" end="00:43:35.500" style="s2">idea of trade specific trading is just</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.730" end="00:43:38.830" style="s2">totally different than the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.500" end="00:43:42.839" style="s2">or maybe a subset yeah I have so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.830" end="00:43:45.099" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a transition case</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.839" end="00:43:46.599" style="s2">so I typically frame things in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.099" end="00:43:48.670" style="s2">following way if you ask yourself how</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.599" end="00:43:51.400" style="s2">human beings are Homo sapiens Homo</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.670" end="00:43:54.630" style="s2">sapiens sapiens ended up surviving I</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.400" end="00:43:58.150" style="s2">only think seeing three basic models one</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.630" end="00:43:59.650" style="s2">we&#39;ve lived off the land in various ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.150" end="00:44:00.940" style="s2">so you think of hunters and gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.650" end="00:44:02.650" style="s2">and then you can also think of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.940" end="00:44:05.770" style="s2">invention of Agriculture around ten to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.650" end="00:44:08.230" style="s2">twelve thousand years ago and you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.770" end="00:44:09.609" style="s2">think of American poet Wendell Berry as</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.230" end="00:44:11.830" style="s2">someone who&#39;s argued that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.609" end="00:44:15.160" style="s2">return to land and live off with it in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.830" end="00:44:17.830" style="s2">humble kindly manner that&#39;s one the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.160" end="00:44:20.410" style="s2">second one is the invention and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.830" end="00:44:23.700" style="s2">utilization of markets specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.410" end="00:44:26.170" style="s2">form of transactions trades or exchanges</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.700" end="00:44:27.160" style="s2">the third one is the hard one to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.170" end="00:44:32.170" style="s2">describe its</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.160" end="00:44:33.970" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s no I call it the gift so</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.170" end="00:44:35.710" style="s2">typically what happens with people is</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.970" end="00:44:37.150" style="s2">that they as it began to question let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.710" end="00:44:41.020" style="s2">say the ubiquity of the market system</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.150" end="00:44:42.310" style="s2">they begin to cast about and they look</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.020" end="00:44:45.330" style="s2">for some alternatives and the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.310" end="00:44:49.720" style="s2">alternative seems to be barter or trade</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.330" end="00:44:52.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not bad it&#39;s not bad this sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.720" end="00:44:54.790" style="s2">that a coaching yeah I have one person I</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.090" end="00:44:58.320" style="s2">speak with who trade trades coaching</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.790" end="00:45:02.590" style="s2">sessions for yoga sessions that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.320" end="00:45:03.850" style="s2">but it&#39;s a good transition case it does</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.590" end="00:45:05.290" style="s2">suggest that there&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.850" end="00:45:06.820" style="s2">can offer and something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.290" end="00:45:09.850" style="s2">offer and we won&#39;t we won&#39;t mediate it</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.820" end="00:45:11.220" style="s2">through the use of money that&#39;s fine but</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.850" end="00:45:13.270" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it quite goes far enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.220" end="00:45:15.190" style="s2">because really what you care about is</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.270" end="00:45:19.630" style="s2">being with that person let&#39;s just make</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.190" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">it clear right you if you&#39;re offering a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.630" end="00:45:24.010" style="s2">coaching session and that person is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:25.210" style="s2">offering intern yoga session really what</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.010" end="00:45:27.160" style="s2">you&#39;re doing okay I&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.210" end="00:45:29.170" style="s2">example from a friend of mine he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.160" end="00:45:31.120" style="s2">his 60s he says that what meant ended by</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.170" end="00:45:33.160" style="s2">the way he&#39;s an older man so this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.120" end="00:45:34.900" style="s2">kind of what men tend to do sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.160" end="00:45:36.310" style="s2">statement says what men tend to do is</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.900" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">that they need the relationships through</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.310" end="00:45:40.750" style="s2">some kind of thing they can&#39;t just talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:43.090" style="s2">to one another they have to watch</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.750" end="00:45:45.570" style="s2">football and kind of look over and chat</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.090" end="00:45:47.620" style="s2">or they have to play some kind of sport</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.570" end="00:45:49.360" style="s2">and while they&#39;re while they&#39;re tossing</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.620" end="00:45:53.050" style="s2">a football back and forth they talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.360" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">about something seriously I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.050" end="00:45:57.100" style="s2">happening here with this this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:58.900" style="s2">trade or barter with with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.100" end="00:46:00.340" style="s2">certain relationships is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.900" end="00:46:03.070" style="s2">not yet the foregrounding of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.340" end="00:46:04.930" style="s2">relationship what gift we&#39;re giving in</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.070" end="00:46:06.910" style="s2">the sense I use it tends to do is it</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.930" end="00:46:09.070" style="s2">finally foregrounds the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.910" end="00:46:10.690" style="s2">that you care about you finally realize</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.070" end="00:46:13.900" style="s2">that that&#39;s what&#39;s substantively at</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.690" end="00:46:16.390" style="s2">stake here and so the gift is the gift</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.900" end="00:46:19.810" style="s2">is sort of the secondary part that helps</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.390" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">to mediate the and so to speak lubricate</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.810" end="00:46:28.270" style="s2">the relationship and I think we notice a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:29.530" style="s2">difference if someone comes over and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.270" end="00:46:32.580" style="s2">out of the blue gives you a gift</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.530" end="00:46:32.580" style="s2">it feels so heartwarming</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.490" end="00:46:37.060" style="s2">expect anything from let&#39;s just remember</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.410" end="00:46:39.490" style="s2">that experience and gives you a gift out</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.060" end="00:46:43.660" style="s2">of the blue and so heartwarming it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.490" end="00:46:48.940" style="s2">lovely can I speak to that it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.660" end="00:46:51.820" style="s2">points there I&#39;ll put my first one my</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.940" end="00:46:54.460" style="s2">second point first what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.820" end="00:46:56.520" style="s2">about a heartwarming gift so I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.460" end="00:46:59.980" style="s2">recently did that for my best friend</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.520" end="00:47:04.360" style="s2">he&#39;s sort of been in dire straits</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.980" end="00:47:07.180" style="s2">recently had suicidal ideation and had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.360" end="00:47:11.380" style="s2">suicide attempt and this had quite bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.180" end="00:47:13.960" style="s2">depression and I had told him you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.380" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">probably all know the show mr. Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.960" end="00:47:21.970" style="s2">neighborhood or have heard of it in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:25.000" style="s2">past and I told him about mr. Rogers and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.970" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">sort of just the simple kindness that he</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.000" end="00:47:33.000" style="s2">showed and I had phone call with him and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:36.250" style="s2">I sung him the song it&#39;s you I like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.000" end="00:47:38.650" style="s2">because I know who I knew who was in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.250" end="00:47:41.050" style="s2">that sort of mindset where he needed</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.650" end="00:47:44.859" style="s2">someone to show him or even gift him</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.050" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">care and at the end of I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.859" end="00:47:50.050" style="s2">the morning after I said hey give me</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:52.390" style="s2">your dress mate went onto Amazon and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.050" end="00:47:55.090" style="s2">ordered him a book of Mister Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.390" end="00:47:57.310" style="s2">quotes and I said this is my gift to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.090" end="00:48:00.460" style="s2">put this on the side of your bed and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.310" end="00:48:03.880" style="s2">anytime you feel sad or you don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.460" end="00:48:07.510" style="s2">cared for just flip your page and think</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.880" end="00:48:12.810" style="s2">of me and that my gift here is just my</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.510" end="00:48:15.670" style="s2">unconditional care and love and that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.810" end="00:48:17.470" style="s2">just what I wanted to speak on on what</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.670" end="00:48:21.100" style="s2">you you&#39;ll print out your last point was</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.470" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">that when we given a gift like that out</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.100" end="00:48:28.570" style="s2">of the blue and without any need for</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:34.060" style="s2">reciprocation or wanting the return it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.570" end="00:48:35.080" style="s2">positively enlightens our soul that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.060" end="00:48:37.900" style="s2">very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.080" end="00:48:39.820" style="s2">thank you there is very heartwarming I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.900" end="00:48:42.160" style="s2">mean that that nails it it&#39;s that I hope</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.820" end="00:48:44.460" style="s2">that everyone heard that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">really the spirit of a gift that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.460" end="00:48:48.730" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:50.500" style="s2">and um and then there&#39;s non-attachment</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.730" end="00:48:55.000" style="s2">so you can&#39;t keep telling the story ten</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.500" end="00:48:59.130" style="s2">years from now and you had to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.000" end="00:49:03.220" style="s2">it so there&#39;s an attachment but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.130" end="00:49:09.460" style="s2">second point as well so we in the form</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.220" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">of a gift run was saying he was doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.460" end="00:49:14.950" style="s2">like a quid pro pro of coaching for</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">another service and now service for</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.950" end="00:49:20.770" style="s2">service is sort of a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:25.080" style="s2">different I don&#39;t have a job currently</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.770" end="00:49:30.490" style="s2">so I do try to give money when I can and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.080" end="00:49:32.980" style="s2">but with me I have quite a lot of skills</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.490" end="00:49:36.070" style="s2">in my repertoire and what I&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.980" end="00:49:40.300" style="s2">if is when I see it as a project or a</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.070" end="00:49:42.430" style="s2">person or idea that I fully support and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.300" end="00:49:44.770" style="s2">I want to see flourish is that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.430" end="00:49:47.530" style="s2">approach that person and offer my skills</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.770" end="00:49:51.220" style="s2">or offer to collaborate with them in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.530" end="00:49:57.430" style="s2">form of what I turn is a gift to help</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.220" end="00:50:00.060" style="s2">the project move on or improve or like</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.430" end="00:50:02.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve been writing for about six years so</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.060" end="00:50:05.280" style="s2">I&#39;ll say hey if you just need to like</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.710" end="00:50:08.080" style="s2">promote posts or if you need me to help</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.280" end="00:50:10.990" style="s2">proofread or edit or something do it for</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.080" end="00:50:14.380" style="s2">free because I believe in this project</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.990" end="00:50:17.050" style="s2">and I want to see is see it move forward</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.380" end="00:50:20.830" style="s2">would you say that is part of the gift</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.050" end="00:50:23.950" style="s2">economy or is that still sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.830" end="00:50:25.990" style="s2">unmarketable type thing Oh since I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.950" end="00:50:30.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the case is probably not thick</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.990" end="00:50:32.380" style="s2">enough I mean to discern but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.100" end="00:50:34.510" style="s2">suppose that you saw something that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.380" end="00:50:37.120" style="s2">really cared about that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.510" end="00:50:40.150" style="s2">case let&#39;s suppose also that you are</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.120" end="00:50:42.310" style="s2">clear about the extent of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.150" end="00:50:44.950" style="s2">commitment otherwise it&#39;ll turn into a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.310" end="00:50:46.660" style="s2">volunteer position of some kind so your</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.950" end="00:50:49.990" style="s2">fruit you clear that it&#39;s rather scoped</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.660" end="00:50:52.740" style="s2">so to say and you&#39;re clearly eerily</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.990" end="00:50:55.570" style="s2">looking for nothing in return you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.740" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s not so to speak like some kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.570" end="00:51:00.549" style="s2">of Weasley internship or something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:02.829" style="s2">that then then it looks like a gift</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.549" end="00:51:05.049" style="s2">now usually what happens here is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.829" end="00:51:06.190" style="s2">people will have altered the really</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.049" end="00:51:07.509" style="s2">interesting part of the point of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.190" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">spiritual practice is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.509" end="00:51:12.099" style="s2">very much investigate your intentions</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:15.220" style="s2">because if it comes to pass the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.099" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">you&#39;re really doing is you&#39;re you you</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.220" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">say it&#39;s a gift but in truth you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:20.859" style="s2">the Art Gallery this is before copan</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:22.809" style="s2">dean so that you could be an intern so</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.859" end="00:51:24.819" style="s2">that you become fully hired and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.809" end="00:51:26.619" style="s2">then it&#39;s fine it&#39;s certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.819" end="00:51:31.240" style="s2">networking strategy but that&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.619" end="00:51:33.329" style="s2">a gift that&#39;s just a right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.240" end="00:51:38.589" style="s2">way to get yourself gainfully employed</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.329" end="00:51:42.700" style="s2">yeah I also think not so much with gifts</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.589" end="00:51:46.200" style="s2">but with Western altruism there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.700" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.200" end="00:51:54.039" style="s2">practice altruism now but not for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.920" end="00:51:56.499" style="s2">sole cause of altruism of compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.039" end="00:51:59.259" style="s2">empathy what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.499" end="00:52:01.869" style="s2">practicing altruism say giving money to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.259" end="00:52:04.119" style="s2">a homeless person because they want that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.869" end="00:52:07.059" style="s2">responsive I&#39;ve done something good I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.119" end="00:52:10.089" style="s2">done my part and they just they want a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.059" end="00:52:12.390" style="s2">dopamine response but they&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.089" end="00:52:15.549" style="s2">it just out of kindness and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.390" end="00:52:18.940" style="s2">they&#39;re wanting something out of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.549" end="00:52:21.819" style="s2">and it is really something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.940" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">in Western cultures in Eastern cultures</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.819" end="00:52:33.720" style="s2">like in Thailand there&#39;s a Buddhist arms</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:41.109" style="s2">which is it&#39;s not a reciprocation it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.720" end="00:52:44.739" style="s2">communal type thing and I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.109" end="00:52:47.739" style="s2">know too much about so-called gift</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.739" end="00:52:50.170" style="s2">economies you know Eastern cultures</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.739" end="00:52:55.420" style="s2">other than that but that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.170" end="00:52:57.700" style="s2">example for contrast great so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.420" end="00:52:59.109" style="s2">important point here no no we have about</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.700" end="00:53:00.430" style="s2">five minutes left so I&#39;m going to open</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.109" end="00:53:05.559" style="s2">it up for anyone else so I&#39;ll make this</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.430" end="00:53:07.150" style="s2">brief is that one reason I like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.559" end="00:53:09.670" style="s2">alternative economy which we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.150" end="00:53:11.769" style="s2">calling a gift economy is that it</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.670" end="00:53:13.690" style="s2">actually does require a purification of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.769" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">your intentions so</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.690" end="00:53:21.010" style="s2">you need to know that you&#39;re giving a</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:22.450" style="s2">gift of guilt not egotism but really out</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.010" end="00:53:24.370" style="s2">of loving kindness when Buddhism that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.450" end="00:53:27.160" style="s2">would be called meta I give this for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.370" end="00:53:29.020" style="s2">sake of the other and and and in</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.160" end="00:53:30.970" style="s2">Aristotle is makes similar he talks</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.020" end="00:53:33.310" style="s2">about true friendship in terms of what I</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.970" end="00:53:37.420" style="s2">called philia that is I care for this</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.310" end="00:53:39.070" style="s2">person for his or her own sake so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.420" end="00:53:41.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of the essence of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.070" end="00:53:43.060" style="s2">practices to learn that but in the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.740" end="00:53:44.680" style="s2">that we have just about four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.060" end="00:53:47.050" style="s2">left so is there anyone else who would</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.680" end="00:53:49.930" style="s2">like to offer something so I just just</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.050" end="00:53:51.100" style="s2">jump in and you you have to go right at</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.930" end="00:53:52.840" style="s2">the hour could you say maybe make five</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.100" end="00:53:56.770" style="s2">ten minutes after just to feel again</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.840" end="00:53:58.660" style="s2">yeah so anyone who hasn&#39;t spoken yet and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.770" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve got something feel free to shop</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:08.710" style="s2">thank you I&#39;m just wondering if you can</p>

<p begin="00:55:19.450" end="00:55:25.030" style="s2">no no okay all right so the first one</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.930" end="00:55:27.460" style="s2">I&#39;m not enough of a historian of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.030" end="00:55:30.430" style="s2">anthropology to build a quite answer but</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.460" end="00:55:32.170" style="s2">I can I can I can venture a hunch and</p>

<p begin="00:55:32.170" end="00:55:39.160" style="s2">that within a tribe you can have in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.559" end="00:55:40.420" style="s2">tribes the circulation of gifts so if</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.160" end="00:55:42.910" style="s2">you want to I can point me some</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.420" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">literature on that so this is within the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.910" end="00:55:47.829" style="s2">tribe circulation of gifts on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:50.050" style="s2">assumption that at a certain level of</p>

<p begin="00:55:50.050" end="00:55:53.859" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have the dispersal of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.059" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">gifts according to the needs of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.859" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">particular ensemble that&#39;s probably true</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:01.240" style="s2">I think you usually begin to notice and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:03.040" style="s2">anthropologists and historians of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.240" end="00:56:06.609" style="s2">economics will correct me if I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.040" end="00:56:09.339" style="s2">that the the trading occurs between</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.609" end="00:56:10.630" style="s2">tribes so this is what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.339" end="00:56:12.609" style="s2">interesting I think we still have that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.630" end="00:56:14.380" style="s2">that intuitions is what I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.609" end="00:56:17.170" style="s2">about in the recent years the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.380" end="00:56:19.630" style="s2">is that to to your friends and the</p>

<p begin="00:56:24.730" end="00:56:29.859" style="s2">seems strange to us this is why PayPal</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.980" end="00:56:33.430" style="s2">is a completely anomalous right neela</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.859" end="00:56:36.010" style="s2">jism because you don&#39;t pay your pals you</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.430" end="00:56:39.160" style="s2">would never pay your pals you give gifts</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.599" end="00:56:46.089" style="s2">sharing economy that&#39;s just game a in a</p>

<p begin="00:56:46.089" end="00:56:51.910" style="s2">never a sharing economy it was always</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:53.589" style="s2">just a hospitality industry we really</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.910" end="00:56:54.549" style="s2">feel that in our sense that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.589" end="00:56:56.109" style="s2">really going to share something with</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.549" end="00:56:57.339" style="s2">someone that looks as though it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.390" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">that&#39;s my first take the second one I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">question about whether or not we should</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.250" end="00:57:22.599" style="s2">limit gifts given to say to NRA and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:28.119" style="s2">never really thought about that very</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.599" end="00:57:34.420" style="s2">much I guess the question would be if</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.119" end="00:57:36.970" style="s2">you granting the granting the existence</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.420" end="00:57:38.680" style="s2">of this entity would it be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.970" end="00:57:41.260" style="s2">gifts would be such as to make it so</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.680" end="00:57:44.500" style="s2">powerful as to be hegemonic or dominant</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.260" end="00:57:46.690" style="s2">in that society that&#39;s the best I can do</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.500" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">at this point that is to say if you were</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.690" end="00:57:50.410" style="s2">to allow for gifts to be given to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">point at which the NRA becomes so huge</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.410" end="00:57:58.060" style="s2">became so huge that gun ownership became</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">so great that the effects of gun</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.060" end="00:58:05.410" style="s2">ownership were so bad for Americans</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.190" end="00:58:09.099" style="s2">which it probably is it&#39;s the best I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.410" end="00:58:12.730" style="s2">say I&#39;m not really sure but thank you</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.099" end="00:58:14.410" style="s2">for your questions I love just this to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.730" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">speak into this you know if I have a</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:25.270" style="s2">know that he has a history of stealing</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.700" end="00:58:28.540" style="s2">you know do I say sorry no shirt no</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.270" end="00:58:32.710" style="s2">shoes no stealers you know no service</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.540" end="00:58:34.690" style="s2">you know like do I is it on me to stop</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.710" end="00:58:37.570" style="s2">that transaction or that interaction</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.690" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">with him because I&#39;m not because I judge</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.570" end="00:58:43.930" style="s2">his actions to be out of alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:46.780" style="s2">my moral value code and I&#39;ve wrestled</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.930" end="00:58:48.910" style="s2">with that and the truth is is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.780" end="00:58:52.450" style="s2">connected to every person anyways and</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.910" end="00:58:55.690" style="s2">it&#39;s not my decision or my choice to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.450" end="00:58:58.329" style="s2">if I&#39;m gonna do that if I want to I will</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.690" end="00:59:00.910" style="s2">but not from a should place but from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.329" end="00:59:03.069" style="s2">desire do I want to interact with this</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.910" end="00:59:05.920" style="s2">person or not and I think that having</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.069" end="00:59:07.780" style="s2">the hood or the rules around it for</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.920" end="00:59:09.220" style="s2">ourself or for others I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.780" end="00:59:11.500" style="s2">just speak to it that like hey when</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.220" end="00:59:14.440" style="s2">we&#39;re gifting we are putting energy into</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.500" end="00:59:17.619" style="s2">something we are watering that plant and</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.440" end="00:59:20.349" style="s2">if that plant is a weed then that weeds</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.619" end="00:59:22.810" style="s2">gonna get bigger and so it&#39;s just part</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.349" end="00:59:25.690" style="s2">of the knowledge that we go into it with</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.810" end="00:59:29.079" style="s2">that awareness so that&#39;s that&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.690" end="00:59:31.390" style="s2">point I wash air and then as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.079" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">second point with with Andre talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.390" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">about like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a bridge right</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:40.030" style="s2">way I&#39;m not sure sorry I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.079" end="00:59:43.060" style="s2">who started this but in terms of giving</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.030" end="00:59:44.890" style="s2">like if you&#39;re giving because you want</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.060" end="00:59:48.700" style="s2">to get the recognition that you&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.890" end="00:59:50.680" style="s2">generous person well that&#39;s okay that</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.700" end="00:59:53.020" style="s2">could be a bridge because you might do</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.680" end="00:59:55.390" style="s2">it for the external validation in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.020" end="00:59:58.180" style="s2">ego and your wife is</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.390" end="01:00:00.130" style="s2">you know think you&#39;re hot stuff because</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.180" end="01:00:01.990" style="s2">you gave you know you&#39;re giving and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.130" end="01:00:05.230" style="s2">you&#39;re such an amazing macho guy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.990" end="01:00:07.660" style="s2">helping the world and then after that</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.230" end="01:00:10.300" style="s2">you get the return on investment of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.660" end="01:00:13.090" style="s2">ripple of impact report from that gift</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.300" end="01:00:15.190" style="s2">and you find out that oh my god all</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.090" end="01:00:18.400" style="s2">these kids were fed all these people and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.190" end="01:00:20.560" style="s2">your heart opens up so potentially you</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.400" end="01:00:21.700" style="s2">might have done it for the egoic you</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.560" end="01:00:23.290" style="s2">might have done it cuz you wanted to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.700" end="01:00:25.060" style="s2">laid you might have done it for all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.290" end="01:00:26.740" style="s2">reasons I I can tell you because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.060" end="01:00:28.690" style="s2">done it for all the reasons myself so</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.740" end="01:00:31.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about them I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.690" end="01:00:34.390" style="s2">about myself and but then after a while</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.570" end="01:00:35.650" style="s2">by putting myself in that situation and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.390" end="01:00:38.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a little kid there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.650" end="01:00:39.610" style="s2">smiling and you know and I&#39;m tearing up</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.080" end="01:00:43.060" style="s2">because I&#39;m remembering when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.610" end="01:00:45.640" style="s2">my heart opens up and this essentially</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.060" end="01:00:47.140" style="s2">supported me getting there which is why</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.640" end="01:00:49.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking that this gift</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.140" end="01:00:52.540" style="s2">economy movement is a combination of</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.150" end="01:00:56.710" style="s2">education conversation like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.540" end="01:00:59.170" style="s2">here and also tools and platforms that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.710" end="01:01:02.530" style="s2">help train somebody kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.170" end="01:01:04.900" style="s2">health app or Fitbit or something where</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.530" end="01:01:07.090" style="s2">people run more with Fitbit not because</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.900" end="01:01:09.100" style="s2">the Fitbit actually makes you run more</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.090" end="01:01:11.260" style="s2">but because you like seeing that score</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.100" end="01:01:13.540" style="s2">go up you&#39;re doing it for the scoring</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.260" end="01:01:16.600" style="s2">reason you&#39;re doing for the seemingly</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.540" end="01:01:20.410" style="s2">wrong reasons but then you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.600" end="01:01:22.600" style="s2">I look good you know I&#39;m just gonna keep</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.410" end="01:01:26.170" style="s2">running because I feel good in my body</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.600" end="01:01:30.490" style="s2">and so the Fitbit was serving as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.170" end="01:01:34.690" style="s2">effective bridge I have a question the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.490" end="01:01:37.690" style="s2">surface and my curiosity is around like</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.690" end="01:01:39.160" style="s2">if I have a gift that I am interested in</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.690" end="01:01:40.690" style="s2">giving because I love to give it so</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.160" end="01:01:44.970" style="s2">gathering people around a freestyle</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.690" end="01:01:48.970" style="s2">campfire giving a gift of an experience</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.970" end="01:01:50.650" style="s2">and yeah I want to be in right</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.970" end="01:01:53.640" style="s2">relationship with the parts of me that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.650" end="01:01:56.650" style="s2">want to mark it and promote and brand</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.640" end="01:01:58.990" style="s2">because I think then there will be a you</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.650" end="01:02:01.840" style="s2">know because I want to receive gifts as</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.990" end="01:02:03.130" style="s2">well and I think that and I want a lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.840" end="01:02:06.820" style="s2">of people to come with these experiences</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.130" end="01:02:08.620" style="s2">but I notice myself yeah like wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.820" end="01:02:10.930" style="s2">proceed with caution in a way</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.620" end="01:02:13.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to bring I want to be wise</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.930" end="01:02:16.540" style="s2">about what game a things I&#39;ve taken on I</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.930" end="01:02:18.700" style="s2">bring into this relationship and what I</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.540" end="01:02:19.690" style="s2">completely leave behind so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.700" end="01:02:22.720" style="s2">curious about any thoughts about how to</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.690" end="01:02:24.520" style="s2">be in right relationship with that right</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.720" end="01:02:27.700" style="s2">I just want to double click and support</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.520" end="01:02:28.600" style="s2">that comment because that&#39;s a challenge</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.700" end="01:02:31.210" style="s2">that I find with the whole stole a</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.600" end="01:02:32.860" style="s2">project of like like I could market it</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.210" end="01:02:35.350" style="s2">more aggressively but I&#39;m not because I</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.860" end="01:02:38.770" style="s2">like the slow build of attracting the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.350" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">right people I don&#39;t think we have the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.770" end="01:02:44.200" style="s2">sort of the ability to transmute noise</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.920" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">into signal right now or kind of keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.200" end="01:02:47.970" style="s2">you going check if too much ego comes in</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:50.890" style="s2">too fast so I&#39;m really curious what and</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.970" end="01:02:53.620" style="s2">remember you had a few not sure what the</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.890" end="01:02:56.170" style="s2">question is exactly if I were to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.620" end="01:02:58.960" style="s2">rephrase it it&#39;s like Tyson he has this</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.170" end="01:03:00.700" style="s2">free style through a pandemic every</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.960" end="01:03:01.870" style="s2">Saturday it was a really quality</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.700" end="01:03:04.270" style="s2">session and he has his own digital</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.870" end="01:03:07.090" style="s2">campfire that he has a few sessions that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.270" end="01:03:08.740" style="s2">he&#39;s stewarding and then the idea is how</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.090" end="01:03:11.790" style="s2">to wisely market to bring more people</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.740" end="01:03:13.660" style="s2">and to find out about it without sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.790" end="01:03:15.190" style="s2">you know I guess attracting the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.660" end="01:03:16.870" style="s2">people or marketing in the wrong way</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.190" end="01:03:24.090" style="s2">where you&#39;re maybe marketing it out of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.870" end="01:03:27.760" style="s2">ego or gamy purposes why do you need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.090" end="01:03:30.070" style="s2">why do you need to market it ok well</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.760" end="01:03:32.020" style="s2">then this might be a way to add into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.070" end="01:03:39.250" style="s2">question is being in right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.020" end="01:03:43.990" style="s2">with the like reliance on a receiving</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.250" end="01:03:47.800" style="s2">gifts and yeah so maybe like if there</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.990" end="01:03:52.090" style="s2">was ever a time for you Andrew where you</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.800" end="01:03:55.360" style="s2">found yourself in feeling a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.090" end="01:03:58.330" style="s2">need for a gift for it like your</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.360" end="01:04:01.200" style="s2">security or well-being or health may be</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.330" end="01:04:06.910" style="s2">that situation has happened maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.200" end="01:04:09.700" style="s2">how did you approach like maybe making</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.910" end="01:04:14.230" style="s2">your offering more widely available or</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.700" end="01:04:17.260" style="s2">more findable found more more awareness</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.230" end="01:04:20.650" style="s2">so that you might then attract more</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.260" end="01:04:22.490" style="s2">people to philosophize with so then that</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.650" end="01:04:23.960" style="s2">you might receive</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.490" end="01:04:26.900" style="s2">more gifts and take better care of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.960" end="01:04:29.090" style="s2">needs and so for me I guess I just have</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.900" end="01:04:31.310" style="s2">I I noticed these like hesitations or</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.090" end="01:04:34.040" style="s2">this caution about marketing and like</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.310" end="01:04:36.500" style="s2">spreading something and because of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.040" end="01:04:39.790" style="s2">part of me that is like wants the gifts</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.500" end="01:04:39.790" style="s2">that are going to come from doing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.619" end="01:04:46.550" style="s2">you just have to investigate I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.119" end="01:04:47.869" style="s2">hate to to make it sound very spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.550" end="01:04:51.470" style="s2">do you have to investigate what you just</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.869" end="01:04:54.170" style="s2">said there I mean I&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.470" end="01:04:57.590" style="s2">marketed I&#39;ve just you know if I may</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.170" end="01:04:59.540" style="s2">speak and like a Sufi I&#39;d say I do the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.590" end="01:05:01.609" style="s2">best that philosophizing and let God</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.540" end="01:05:03.589" style="s2">take care of the rest</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.609" end="01:05:05.869" style="s2">you can put that in stoical terms if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.589" end="01:05:07.670" style="s2">want to you know see what&#39;s within my</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.869" end="01:05:14.599" style="s2">powers and I will let the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.670" end="01:05:15.950" style="s2">lest of its a more fatty that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.599" end="01:05:18.140" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it seemed like a ton</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.950" end="01:05:19.940" style="s2">traumatic answer but you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.140" end="01:05:23.450" style="s2">investigate that feeling of meat and</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.940" end="01:05:25.789" style="s2">feeling a want contraction because if</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.450" end="01:05:28.220" style="s2">you know you know the trust comes in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.789" end="01:05:31.309" style="s2">following manner if if this is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.220" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">beautiful thing it&#39;s a truly beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.309" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">thing then people will find it</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.539" end="01:05:43.279" style="s2">that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.339" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">Bishan sits as well let&#39;s do Tom last</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.279" end="01:05:50.749" style="s2">question and then we&#39;ll close up Thanks</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:53.650" style="s2">yeah so be sort of pragmatic I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.749" end="01:05:55.999" style="s2">what Tyson and Peter are getting at is</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.650" end="01:05:59.329" style="s2">different than what you&#39;re doing Andrew</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.999" end="01:06:01.700" style="s2">and maybe what Ron is doing because I</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.329" end="01:06:04.460" style="s2">think Ron and Andrew biased I believe</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.700" end="01:06:08.180" style="s2">are working one-on-one with individuals</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.460" end="01:06:09.499" style="s2">and then sort of negotiating or going</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.180" end="01:06:14.089" style="s2">through a series of questions of what</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.499" end="01:06:15.829" style="s2">can you give me or give me where as</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.089" end="01:06:18.140" style="s2">Peters got you know a bunch of us</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.829" end="01:06:19.849" style="s2">collected here Tyson it sounds like you</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.140" end="01:06:25.009" style="s2">also are collecting people you know like</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.849" end="01:06:26.450" style="s2">a group so my question is and to throw</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.009" end="01:06:29.650" style="s2">in an opinion quickly to Roger I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.450" end="01:06:32.390" style="s2">little worried that there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.650" end="01:06:34.249" style="s2">reliance on Gideon&#39;s people&#39;s ego into</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.390" end="01:06:36.849" style="s2">having a score about what they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.249" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">which is kind of the market economy of</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.849" end="01:06:41.150" style="s2">especially nonprofits in which people</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.200" end="01:06:45.680" style="s2">who love just everybody&#39;s know how great</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.150" end="01:06:47.569" style="s2">they are anyways there&#39;s there&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.680" end="01:06:50.210" style="s2">question for me is maybe this can help</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.569" end="01:06:53.180" style="s2">Peter and Tyson Andrew how would you</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.210" end="01:06:55.369" style="s2">help them besides what I assume is</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.180" end="01:06:58.219" style="s2">they&#39;d have to ask me individually how</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.369" end="01:06:59.539" style="s2">would you help them increase those of us</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.219" end="01:07:08.749" style="s2">who may want to give something to them</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.539" end="01:07:10.819" style="s2">but we need to be asked okay so I like I</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.749" end="01:07:13.839" style="s2">think you got this time I like fine fine</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.819" end="01:07:17.089" style="s2">grains well-tuned</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.839" end="01:07:19.249" style="s2">responses so the first thing we said</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.089" end="01:07:21.920" style="s2">occurred earlier which is that on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.249" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">website I would make the what you might</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.920" end="01:07:28.789" style="s2">call the ask much clearer much much</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:32.479" style="s2">clearer what is it what is what does</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.789" end="01:07:35.150" style="s2">Peter say really need and so he has to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.479" end="01:07:37.609" style="s2">know himself much better than was</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.150" end="01:07:40.940" style="s2">presented so far another thing you could</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.609" end="01:07:43.369" style="s2">do if you wanted to the other thing that</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.940" end="01:07:44.779" style="s2">I always do and this is not because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.369" end="01:07:47.359" style="s2">not location is that whatever someone</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.779" end="01:07:50.239" style="s2">gives a gift I will write right back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.359" end="01:07:51.710" style="s2">that person that&#39;s the person wants to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.239" end="01:07:53.119" style="s2">know that I received the gift and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.710" end="01:07:54.210" style="s2">received it well and I want to know</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.119" end="01:07:55.920" style="s2">something about the person</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.210" end="01:07:58.770" style="s2">so that&#39;s a way of developing a</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.920" end="01:08:00.810" style="s2">relationship with that person and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.770" end="01:08:03.420" style="s2">something that Peter and enticing could</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.810" end="01:08:04.500" style="s2">you but then the third thing that could</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.420" end="01:08:07.290" style="s2">be really interesting is that some</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.500" end="01:08:09.000" style="s2">people want to as people say they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.290" end="01:08:11.070" style="s2">vulnerable then they could actually say</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.000" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">look Peter do you wanna have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.070" end="01:08:14.430" style="s2">conversation I can offer we can talk</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:16.680" style="s2">about what would be a reasonable gift</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.430" end="01:08:18.480" style="s2">for you to offer for me to offer you you</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.680" end="01:08:19.650" style="s2">could do some of those sessions that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.480" end="01:08:21.299" style="s2">would give him a sense of what people</p>
