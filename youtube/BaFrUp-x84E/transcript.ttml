<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:34.250" style="s2">about food yeah once the set is good -</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.420" end="00:32:37.540" style="s2">it&#39;s better see it&#39;s even better for</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.250" end="00:32:40.370" style="s2">five at some point you become obese</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.540" end="00:32:44.030" style="s2">okay whatever is good taking it to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.370" end="00:32:45.770" style="s2">extreme negates itself okay so you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.030" end="00:32:49.640" style="s2">to say when to select and not to select</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.770" end="00:32:51.110" style="s2">that is the third scale so more is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.640" end="00:32:53.210" style="s2">better it&#39;s one of the reasons we do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.110" end="00:32:56.150" style="s2">why not because I can afford it so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.210" end="00:32:59.780" style="s2">buy unnecessary things because you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.150" end="00:33:01.400" style="s2">afford it okay and sometimes we do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.780" end="00:33:03.320" style="s2">impress others you buy a bigger car</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.400" end="00:33:05.090" style="s2">bigger house not because you need a</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.320" end="00:33:08.840" style="s2">bigger house or a bigger car</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.090" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">but impresses somebody else and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:16.039" style="s2">certainly we also attempted by or mind</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:18.620" style="s2">painting a positive image you go there</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.039" end="00:33:20.389" style="s2">you see a pair of shoes and say what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.620" end="00:33:22.700" style="s2">beautiful and you can imagine how well</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.230" end="00:33:34.970" style="s2">in fact I&#39;ve seen people who would open</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.700" end="00:33:36.830" style="s2">the hood a walk-in closet and say I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.970" end="00:33:38.629" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything to wear I walk in</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.700" end="00:33:53.929" style="s2">positive image so we indulge in excess</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.639" end="00:33:58.700" style="s2">for various reasons so to get away from</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.929" end="00:34:02.149" style="s2">it exercise suggests this exercise pause</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.700" end="00:34:05.230" style="s2">and ponder with the pleasure lost yeah I</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:42.869" style="s2">and then the the final skill that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.460" end="00:34:45.540" style="s2">would need is courage courage is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.869" end="00:34:46.669" style="s2">understanding what is terrible and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.540" end="00:34:48.899" style="s2">is not terrible</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.669" end="00:34:50.429" style="s2">okay what is terrible and what&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:35:06.830" style="s2">its death terrible this this is terrible</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.530" end="00:35:10.290" style="s2">it&#39;s old age terrible what is terrible</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.290" end="00:35:16.859" style="s2">terrible well for most people this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.550" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">terrible poverty is terrible death is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.859" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">terrible but stoic say no they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:29.369" style="s2">terrible they are a reality not whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:32.130" style="s2">this reality is not terrible poverty</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.369" end="00:35:32.790" style="s2">disease that is not terrible you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.130" end="00:35:34.950" style="s2">control it</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.790" end="00:35:38.930" style="s2">what is terrible is your faulty</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.950" end="00:35:41.730" style="s2">judgments that&#39;s terrible you control it</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.930" end="00:35:44.430" style="s2">so what is terrible and what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.730" end="00:35:46.700" style="s2">terrible comes from your judgment not</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.430" end="00:35:50.190" style="s2">from out there not from with them</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.700" end="00:35:52.920" style="s2">poverty is not terrible that is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.190" end="00:35:56.130" style="s2">terrible this is it&#39;s not terrible not</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.920" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">that you would invite it not invited not</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.130" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">that you should relish it it&#39;s just if</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.410" style="s2">it happens it&#39;s not terrible you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:03.410" style="s2">still be happy</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.340" end="00:36:11.500" style="s2">the reason why we do that is we act as</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.710" end="00:36:13.300" style="s2">though we are helpless but we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.500" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">resources to cope anything that comes</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.300" end="00:36:19.300" style="s2">our way let&#39;s assume let me assume the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:22.410" style="s2">average age of people here older younger</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.300" end="00:36:25.870" style="s2">maybe 35 years suppose it is 35 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.410" end="00:36:29.410" style="s2">you live 35 years facing all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.870" end="00:36:32.500" style="s2">problems you faced they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.410" end="00:36:34.570" style="s2">repeat again so if you faced it so far</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.500" end="00:36:38.890" style="s2">you&#39;ll be able to face it in the future</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.570" end="00:36:40.630" style="s2">but we say so you ask yourself if this</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.890" end="00:36:44.470" style="s2">happens to have any resource to cope</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.630" end="00:36:47.860" style="s2">with this the line a supermarket is long</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.470" end="00:36:49.840" style="s2">or long itself complaining about they</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.860" end="00:36:54.070" style="s2">say what resources you have to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.840" end="00:36:58.330" style="s2">it your patience we can be patient you</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.070" end="00:37:01.960" style="s2">have something you are doing something</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.330" end="00:37:04.360" style="s2">that is hard we have any strength took</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.960" end="00:37:05.500" style="s2">what was think we have what you chose to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.360" end="00:37:09.340" style="s2">do we have to cope with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.500" end="00:37:13.270" style="s2">you have endurance somebody is abusing</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.340" end="00:37:15.850" style="s2">you and you have no way out what string</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.270" end="00:37:18.130" style="s2">to have your mental strength so you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.850" end="00:37:21.240" style="s2">resources to cope with anything that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.130" end="00:37:21.240" style="s2">happens in your life anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:29.700" style="s2">once you realize that then you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.300" end="00:37:31.410" style="s2">don&#39;t complain about what might happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.700" end="00:37:32.760" style="s2">in the future whatever happens happens</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.410" end="00:37:37.670" style="s2">because you have the strength to cope</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.760" end="00:37:42.270" style="s2">with it okay so these are the four</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.670" end="00:37:49.220" style="s2">virtues or four things four special</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.270" end="00:37:51.560" style="s2">skills so to review the foundation is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.220" end="00:37:54.210" style="s2">happiness is a life that flows smoothly</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.560" end="00:37:56.730" style="s2">our life is not working properly because</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.210" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">our thoughts prevent us from doing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.730" end="00:38:03.420" style="s2">and to and to make our life work</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:07.800" style="s2">properly we should ignore what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.420" end="00:38:08.820" style="s2">control act on what we do control try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.800" end="00:38:10.920" style="s2">make this happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.820" end="00:38:13.130" style="s2">we should you apply four skills skill</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.920" end="00:38:14.790" style="s2">number one what to do what not to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.130" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">skill number two</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.790" end="00:38:24.150" style="s2">whose is this truth is not this skill</p>
