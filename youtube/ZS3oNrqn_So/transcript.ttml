<p begin="00:00:00.290" end="00:00:05.609" style="s2">so hi my name&#39;s Joe brewer and today I</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.240" end="00:00:07.140" style="s2">want to give you a brief update about</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.609" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">how we are launching the field of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">culture design and specifically I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:14.219" style="s2">to talk to you about the work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:16.980" style="s2">doing here at the Oregon Research</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.219" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">Institute where I&#39;ve had an office since</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.980" end="00:00:23.100" style="s2">May and I&#39;ve been carefully building up</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">the relationships and the vision for</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.100" end="00:00:27.000" style="s2">creating a research center that we plan</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">to launch in the spring and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.000" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">research center is called least</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">currently that culture design Institute</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:36.600" style="s2">and what we are planning to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">is to really bring together the best</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.600" end="00:00:40.309" style="s2">scientific knowledge available about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">social change works</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.309" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">combined with the best research from</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">prevention science behavioral science</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">Public Health Science about what creates</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">health and well-being B&#39;s so for example</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">the Oregon Research Institute has more</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">than 60 years of history doing research</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:03.210" style="s2">funded by the National Institutes of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:04.489" style="s2">Health to study things like the social</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:07.700" style="s2">determinants of health and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.489" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">the social dynamics that give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.700" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">conflict and coercion bullying studies</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">of healthy lifestyle activities or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">use of marketing to spread unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:22.820" style="s2">activities especially things like</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">excessive alcohol consumption or smoking</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.820" end="00:01:27.720" style="s2">so this is a place that has a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:30.390" style="s2">history of doing behavioral research in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.720" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">public health research one of the areas</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:37.700" style="s2">that they focused on is in program</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2">evaluation where they set up large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.700" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">comparisons between interventions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.229" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">communities where something is done to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:46.829" style="s2">promote well-being to the community in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">another community where either a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.829" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">different intervention is used or no</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:52.470" style="s2">intervention is used and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">developed rigorous methodologies for how</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.470" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">to do this this is kind of best</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">practices of public health research so</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:02.969" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing is building on this</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:05.729" style="s2">legacy of many decades of research done</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.969" end="00:02:07.700" style="s2">by researchers here as well as similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.729" end="00:02:12.030" style="s2">kinds of research done by other places</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.700" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">and our vision is to bring this together</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.030" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">with other kinds of knowledge like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">work I&#39;ve been doing for the last few</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:20.910" style="s2">years to help organize the several dozen</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">academic disciplines that inform the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.910" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">study of culture 11 to create the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:27.990" style="s2">ability for communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:30.930" style="s2">struggling to create social change to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.990" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">able to do so with rigor and with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.930" end="00:02:35.640" style="s2">ability to track their own changes as</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">they go so for example there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.640" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">currently a lot of small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">communities with maybe five thousand to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:43.410" style="s2">fifteen or twenty thousand people in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">them that are trying to become more</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.410" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">resilient in a world of global warming</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:49.739" style="s2">and are trying to become more</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:52.590" style="s2">sustainable in various ways you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.739" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">building up stronger local community</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.590" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">supports for agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">regenerative farming or doing things</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:05.550" style="s2">like trying to combine local schooling</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">practices with engagement that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.550" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">people in the community so if they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">more continuity between generations of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:12.780" style="s2">people you know their whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:14.910" style="s2">issues like this that plague small to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.780" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">medium sized communities and what those</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.910" end="00:03:21.269" style="s2">communities generally lack is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:23.640" style="s2">support of really strong robust social</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.269" end="00:03:27.269" style="s2">science to help them know how to guide</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.640" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">change toward better outcomes and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.269" end="00:03:32.010" style="s2">more fundamentally they often lack the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">ability to see the changes happening in</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.010" end="00:03:35.549" style="s2">their community in a way that they could</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:38.070" style="s2">then work with the guide social changes</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.549" end="00:03:41.480" style="s2">so a big part of this will be to set up</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.070" end="00:03:43.799" style="s2">monitoring systems that just like in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.480" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">environmental management where you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.799" end="00:03:48.390" style="s2">set up a network of sensors for a river</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">basin to watch changes in stream flows</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.390" end="00:03:53.310" style="s2">or the slope of the bank of the water or</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">things like this that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.310" end="00:03:57.390" style="s2">with the health of the river system that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">there are ways of setting up sensors</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.390" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">networks for tracking social change</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">dynamics within communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:09.470" style="s2">related to known public health risks or</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:12.049" style="s2">positive health outcomes so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.470" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">policymakers community leaders</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.049" end="00:04:17.729" style="s2">grassroots activists can work together</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:20.220" style="s2">with local businesses with local</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.729" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">community organizations to see these</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:23.860" style="s2">change processes happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">in real-time and the guy changes toward</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.860" end="00:04:28.330" style="s2">desired goals that have been set by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:30.879" style="s2">entire community so this is work that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.330" end="00:04:33.159" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be doing starting in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.879" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">spring of 2018 when we launched the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.159" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">culture design Institute to build this</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:41.620" style="s2">kind of integrated research capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:43.479" style="s2">start reaching out with the growing</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.620" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">array of tools that we&#39;ll have at our</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.479" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">disposal to work with community change</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:52.440" style="s2">practitioners will be offering trainings</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:55.449" style="s2">and many schools and retreats as well as</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.440" end="00:04:56.979" style="s2">participating with cities or with</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.449" end="00:04:59.020" style="s2">nonprofits that are working to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.979" end="00:05:01.539" style="s2">change to improve the programs that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.020" end="00:05:03.880" style="s2">they&#39;re already running or to design and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.539" end="00:05:06.099" style="s2">collaboratively deploy new programs that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.880" end="00:05:08.259" style="s2">they will be able to implement in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.099" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">future so this is just a little update</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.259" end="00:05:12.099" style="s2">about what we&#39;re doing and to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:14.020" style="s2">little bit of flavor of what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.099" end="00:05:17.169" style="s2">down the pipes for the fields of culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.020" end="00:05:20.770" style="s2">design so I hope you will get involved</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.169" end="00:05:23.740" style="s2">and learn more support us here simply by</p>
