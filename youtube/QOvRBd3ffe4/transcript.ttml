<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:04.049" style="s2">okay today I want to try to see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.949" end="00:00:07.350" style="s2">roll out two different related concepts</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:09.360" style="s2">the first concept comes from Angela</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.350" end="00:00:12.780" style="s2">named max-neef these are called</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:16.550" style="s2">satisfiers and the second concept is my</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.780" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">own and I call it reinvention so</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.550" end="00:00:23.490" style="s2">satisfiers the idea here is to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:25.350" style="s2">that human societies come together to</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.490" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">among other things</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.350" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">find ways to more effectively satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:32.940" style="s2">human needs so for example we have some</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">number of basic human needs that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.940" end="00:00:36.950" style="s2">endeavoring to figure out how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:41.719" style="s2">miss all we need to eat we need to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.950" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">and we construct different solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.719" end="00:00:47.340" style="s2">finding ways to satisfy those needs so</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">I&#39;d imagine that back in the old days we</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.340" end="00:00:52.170" style="s2">would figure out different tools and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:54.809" style="s2">techniques for hunting or gathering in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.170" end="00:00:56.940" style="s2">preparing the things that are gathered</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.809" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">into edible food these are satisfiers</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.940" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">and these are culturally invented</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">culturally propagated tools in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">modern era we go out to a restaurant or</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:09.869" style="s2">we make money and go to a grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">on occasion we may be grown but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.869" end="00:01:14.790" style="s2">is that this is a basic general</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">framework the idea of satisfiers and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:19.080" style="s2">important inside of satisfiers is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:23.400" style="s2">recognize that there&#39;s two components</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.080" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">one is the the underlined need the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.400" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">that actually in the sense is very solid</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">and enduring under most human societies</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">to eat is going to be a problem to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">solved and then there&#39;s the the much</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">more ephemeral actual satisfier the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">that we go about doing it now if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">think about the frameworks from some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:46.670" style="s2">the previous episodes around like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t describe attractors yet but</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">Fitness landscapes are reasonably close</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">or phase spaces or the way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">complicated systems feedback and on each</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:02.250" style="s2">other in the danger plus model we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">also notice that satisfiers tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.250" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">entangled with each other so for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:09.569" style="s2">as I described it earlier if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:10.830" style="s2">go to the grocery store to buy food you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.569" end="00:02:13.630" style="s2">also need to figure out how to go about</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.830" end="00:02:16.810" style="s2">getting money to be able to buy the food</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.630" end="00:02:19.060" style="s2">so now the food satisfier is linked up</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.810" end="00:02:22.930" style="s2">also to another satisfier associated</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">with in this case productivity and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.930" end="00:02:31.390" style="s2">to produce goods and services in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">economy so within the satisfier concept</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.390" end="00:02:34.890" style="s2">is only a few more things to roll out</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:39.010" style="s2">and then i can move on to reinvention</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.890" end="00:02:43.330" style="s2">what is that we can actually notice that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.010" end="00:02:46.450" style="s2">the satisfiers can be related in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.330" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">of a continuum that the they&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.450" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">satisfy our said as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">defectively go about meeting our needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:54.460" style="s2">and then there are satisfiers that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:56.410" style="s2">less effective at meeting our needs but</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.460" end="00:02:58.150" style="s2">better than good satisfiers are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:00.100" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t even call synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.150" end="00:03:02.070" style="s2">satisfiers so this is a satisfying that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.100" end="00:03:05.350" style="s2">maybe meets multiple needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.070" end="00:03:07.890" style="s2">simultaneously say for example going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.350" end="00:03:10.990" style="s2">a picnic which might meet needs around</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.890" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">being in nature and conviviality with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.990" end="00:03:14.440" style="s2">other human beings and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:16.120" style="s2">surfacing potential mating opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.440" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">or creative collaboration opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.120" end="00:03:20.890" style="s2">in addition to eating which is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:22.150" style="s2">different than say having pizza</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.890" end="00:03:26.380" style="s2">delivered to your house and just eating</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">it and then the opposite side of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.380" end="00:03:34.780" style="s2">spectrum are satisfiers that show up as</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:40.090" style="s2">meeting your need but don&#39;t say for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.780" end="00:03:44.170" style="s2">example let&#39;s say a piece of a fast food</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.090" end="00:03:47.050" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t actually have any</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.170" end="00:03:48.580" style="s2">nutritional value or even worse is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.050" end="00:03:51.940" style="s2">satisfier that actually makes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.580" end="00:03:55.360" style="s2">problem worse so say for example a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.940" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">beverage likes a Coca Cola that presents</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:04:00.550" style="s2">itself as satisfying that need for</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:02.170" style="s2">thirst for water but in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.550" end="00:04:03.670" style="s2">makes you thirsty ok so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.170" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">the continuum of status bars to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.670" end="00:04:12.220" style="s2">mind so so now to the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:16.170" style="s2">reinvention if we if we notice that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.220" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">are surrounded by a social milieu of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.170" end="00:04:22.419" style="s2">different satisfiers that are operating</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">at differential levels of effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.419" end="00:04:27.530" style="s2">on this continuum some are synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:31.160" style="s2">and some are in fact inhibitory</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.530" end="00:04:33.230" style="s2">and yet we also noticed that there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.160" end="00:04:34.790" style="s2">fundamental human needs and these set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.230" end="00:04:37.820" style="s2">stars relate to each other very</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.790" end="00:04:41.240" style="s2">complicated fashion we can then imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.820" end="00:04:43.400" style="s2">grasping a particular social institution</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.240" end="00:04:44.690" style="s2">that shows up in the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.400" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">environment in the environment that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.690" end="00:04:51.160" style="s2">we&#39;re in and endeavor to undergo a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:53.389" style="s2">process that I&#39;m calling reinvention so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.160" end="00:04:57.560" style="s2">let&#39;s take journalism and exam as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.389" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">example so first order we to reinvent we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.560" end="00:05:02.950" style="s2">have to recognize that the thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:07.100" style="s2">are dealing with is a satisfier not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.950" end="00:05:10.700" style="s2">underlying need itself so journalism is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.100" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">not meaningful or this is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.700" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">meaningfully understood as say for</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:16.660" style="s2">example the media itself journalism is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:19.900" style="s2">not newspapers journalism it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.660" end="00:05:23.210" style="s2">television news it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.900" end="00:05:24.500" style="s2">meaningfully the processes that work</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.210" end="00:05:26.330" style="s2">within and give rise to those</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.500" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">institutional structures so journalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.330" end="00:05:30.500" style="s2">is not what you learn in journalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">school journalism isn&#39;t the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.500" end="00:05:35.930" style="s2">processes about how one goes about doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:38.390" style="s2">good editorial these are all functional</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.930" end="00:05:41.150" style="s2">adaptive structures inside a particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.390" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">institutional framework that to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.150" end="00:05:45.250" style="s2">greater or lesser extent makes that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:48.470" style="s2">framework actually deliver on the need</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.250" end="00:05:50.870" style="s2">but they aren&#39;t the thing itself so so</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.470" end="00:05:54.350" style="s2">the thing we have to do is we have to in</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.870" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">some sense turn up the temperature at a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.350" end="00:06:00.380" style="s2">conceptual level and boil away the axes</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:02.330" style="s2">boil away the artifacts of how we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.380" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">gone about satisfying a certain need</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.330" end="00:06:06.169" style="s2">until we get closer and closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:08.900" style="s2">much more solid and during core what</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.169" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">that need might be so in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.900" end="00:06:15.669" style="s2">journalism we might say that the essence</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">of the core of journalism is a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.669" end="00:06:25.010" style="s2">fundamental social need to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:30.020" style="s2">source and disseminate and make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.010" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">our environment at a social level so to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.020" end="00:06:37.449" style="s2">use the the concepts of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:40.029" style="s2">journalism is associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.449" end="00:06:42.279" style="s2">exception and the intelligence portions</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.029" end="00:06:44.289" style="s2">of sovereignty at a social level and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.279" end="00:06:48.159" style="s2">there are many of us and you might</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.289" end="00:06:52.120" style="s2">imagine it&#39;s for example in the older</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.159" end="00:06:54.520" style="s2">times that there&#39;s a good hunting ground</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.120" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">over there and so journalism is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.520" end="00:06:57.580" style="s2">process where the people who have</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:59.499" style="s2">discovered that information bring it</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.580" end="00:07:02.169" style="s2">back and share that information with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.499" end="00:07:04.059" style="s2">larger tribe so that that information is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.169" end="00:07:07.029" style="s2">effectively disseminated throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.059" end="00:07:10.089" style="s2">whole and now the whole can now process</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.029" end="00:07:12.009" style="s2">that information perhaps an elder has an</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.089" end="00:07:13.930" style="s2">interesting insight on previous times we</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.009" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">had similar situations and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.930" end="00:07:17.439" style="s2">collective intelligence is able to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:19.169" style="s2">better choices and engage in more</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.439" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">effective activities so it&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.169" end="00:07:25.029" style="s2">form of group sovereignty and as such</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:27.419" style="s2">you might say that the journalism is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.029" end="00:07:29.379" style="s2">actually neatly connected to science</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.419" end="00:07:31.270" style="s2">science is also part of that same</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.379" end="00:07:35.050" style="s2">complex it tends to maybe go more in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.270" end="00:07:36.729" style="s2">depth about getting more clarity on what</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.050" end="00:07:39.399" style="s2">is the nature of things what about what</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.729" end="00:07:41.860" style="s2">is what is true where the journalism is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.399" end="00:07:43.419" style="s2">more about what is but these two things</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.860" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">are related very closely into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.419" end="00:07:49.990" style="s2">broader problem of collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:51.939" style="s2">making and so what you can then do is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.990" end="00:07:55.419" style="s2">say okay great let&#39;s take the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.939" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">recognition that things change and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.419" end="00:08:00.969" style="s2">one particular satisfier of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:03.069" style="s2">underlying need say for example the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.969" end="00:08:05.740" style="s2">newspapers and television news that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.069" end="00:08:10.089" style="s2">developed during the 19th and 20th</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.740" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">century may need to be reinvented so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.089" end="00:08:13.659" style="s2">great well do what we just did we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.339" style="s2">turn the temperature up we&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.659" end="00:08:17.770" style="s2">cause ourselves to be able to separate</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.339" end="00:08:20.649" style="s2">from the the frameworks and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.770" end="00:08:22.659" style="s2">architectures that exist now boil it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.649" end="00:08:24.939" style="s2">down to the core essence recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.659" end="00:08:28.209" style="s2">there&#39;s this really deep enduring social</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.939" end="00:08:29.999" style="s2">function and then the last step is then</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.209" end="00:08:32.319" style="s2">begin the process of endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.999" end="00:08:34.329" style="s2">redesign satisfiers</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.319" end="00:08:37.300" style="s2">in the contemporary environment say okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.329" end="00:08:41.229" style="s2">great we certainly do need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.300" end="00:08:43.750" style="s2">capacity to do social sensible you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.229" end="00:08:45.459" style="s2">do collaborative sense-making but we</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.750" end="00:08:46.990" style="s2">actually have new tools we have new</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.459" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">mechanisms to go about gathering</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.990" end="00:08:51.490" style="s2">information from the edge perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.709" style="s2">from a larger social whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.490" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">bringing that information in putting it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.709" end="00:08:58.810" style="s2">in the hands or in the minds of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:01.269" style="s2">individuals or groups who are most</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:03.490" style="s2">effectively able to make sense of it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.269" end="00:09:05.439" style="s2">then allow that sense making itself to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.490" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">propagate out so that people have access</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.439" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">to the the best perspective is the best</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:11.459" style="s2">wisdom that&#39;s available in the larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:11.459" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.850" end="00:09:16.449" style="s2">okay so then then we just need to start</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.620" end="00:09:20.350" style="s2">thinking about what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.449" end="00:09:22.089" style="s2">in the contemporary environment and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.350" end="00:09:23.949" style="s2">I&#39;d like to do just to close and I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.089" end="00:09:27.129" style="s2">I&#39;m getting to the end of the attention</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.949" end="00:09:28.660" style="s2">span of the contemporary human is think</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.129" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">about this in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.660" end="00:09:35.740" style="s2">complicated in the complex we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:37.779" style="s2">proposition that we are reaching the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.740" end="00:09:40.750" style="s2">the end of the useful life of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.779" end="00:09:42.790" style="s2">complicated structures and that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.750" end="00:09:45.009" style="s2">the the appropriate approach as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.790" end="00:09:47.050" style="s2">engaging in redesigns or engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.009" end="00:09:48.879" style="s2">reinvention is to contemplate how we</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.050" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">might solve problems how we might</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.879" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">generate satisfiers in a in a fashion</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:57.610" style="s2">that is more fully in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:10:00.579" style="s2">complexity and so here for example our</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.610" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">friend Dave Snowden has already done</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.579" end="00:10:08.110" style="s2">deep work he&#39;s proposed an approach he</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">caused the human sensor network whereby</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.110" end="00:10:14.259" style="s2">every individual human symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:16.949" style="s2">meaning everybody plays a role in</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.259" end="00:10:19.779" style="s2">sensing the environment and then in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.949" end="00:10:23.290" style="s2">providing that sensing and since making</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.779" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">back into a shared social milieu and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.290" end="00:10:29.139" style="s2">then also in curating what is from</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:31.779" style="s2">perception into sense and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.139" end="00:10:33.100" style="s2">into meaning and then this can then be</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.779" end="00:10:36.389" style="s2">handed off to a different structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.100" end="00:10:38.559" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with choice making I</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.389" end="00:10:40.930" style="s2">think that&#39;s all I want to do right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.559" end="00:10:42.850" style="s2">if there&#39;s interest perhaps in the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.930" end="00:10:45.009" style="s2">video I&#39;ll dig a little bit deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.850" end="00:10:47.740" style="s2">what this human sensor network might</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.009" end="00:10:50.050" style="s2">look like and how it quite distinctly is</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.740" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">different from social media and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.050" end="00:10:57.160" style="s2">different from a very pure information</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:10:58.509" style="s2">approach that is this weird intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.160" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">space between the complicated and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.509" end="00:11:02.730" style="s2">complex but is the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:05.020" style="s2">instinctual response that we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.730" end="00:11:07.810" style="s2">without thinking deeply about</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.020" end="00:11:09.250" style="s2">the nature of what are what the needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.810" end="00:11:10.420" style="s2">are that we&#39;re trying to solve what the</p>
