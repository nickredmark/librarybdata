<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">with blogging and the output became a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.849" end="00:02:15.390" style="s2">network blogging system</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:18.269" style="s2">which is exactly what you see with</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.390" end="00:02:21.299" style="s2">Facebook and Twitter and the like or</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.269" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">medium yeah sort of a classic network</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.390" end="00:02:39.450" style="s2">their way up to deep things but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.859" end="00:02:41.670" style="s2">start with your take on the recent</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.450" end="00:02:44.370" style="s2">attack on the Saudi Arabian fuel</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.670" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">processing center what do we know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.370" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">going on well um we were completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:51.319" style="s2">surprised</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">across the board we didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.319" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">human or SIGINT indication that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">attack was coming so is a failure of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">intelligence and then there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">failure of battlefield intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:05.579" style="s2">battlefield awareness we weren&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:08.129" style="s2">detect the attack until it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.579" end="00:03:10.530" style="s2">commencing and in process it went by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.129" end="00:03:12.470" style="s2">aegis destroyers in the Gulf you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.530" end="00:03:14.900" style="s2">with their air defense systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.470" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">state-of-the-art I don&#39;t you know flat</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.900" end="00:03:20.549" style="s2">pancake flat terrain which is like in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:23.579" style="s2">perfect environment to detect missiles</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.549" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">and drones and then you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.579" end="00:03:28.590" style="s2">Patriot missile batteries I think the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">Saudis had 88 this attack blew right</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.590" end="00:03:32.909" style="s2">past them - they didn&#39;t detect it at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:35.400" style="s2">essentially no I know the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.909" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">that actually triggered was the the guns</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:41.790" style="s2">attached to the point defense system set</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:43.319" style="s2">up at the at the processing facility so</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.790" end="00:03:45.560" style="s2">essentially what we had is a you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.319" end="00:03:49.010" style="s2">completely surprising attack and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.560" end="00:03:53.489" style="s2">probably the most well defended most</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.010" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">important oil or energy hub in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.489" end="00:03:58.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know for years I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.430" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">decades everyone&#39;s been speculating in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.530" end="00:04:02.519" style="s2">at you know how this facility would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:05.430" style="s2">attacked it&#39;s you know AB cake is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.519" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">attached to guar and guar is the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.430" end="00:04:09.449" style="s2">massive oil field that&#39;s produced I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:11.849" style="s2">think a succeed is 70% of all of Saudi</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.449" end="00:04:14.909" style="s2">Arabia&#39;s oil produces 5 million barrels</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.849" end="00:04:15.299" style="s2">a day little over and it&#39;s been doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.909" end="00:04:18.630" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.299" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">for 250 years and abdicate processes it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.630" end="00:04:24.120" style="s2">takes out the sulfur it does it&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:27.540" style="s2">know a monstrous facility has you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.120" end="00:04:29.370" style="s2">very expensive equipment yet you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.540" end="00:04:32.310" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously very vulnerable to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.370" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">new type of attack drones relatively</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.310" end="00:04:36.810" style="s2">slowly being able to maneuver to come in</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:39.990" style="s2">from directions that aren&#39;t anticipated</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.810" end="00:04:42.750" style="s2">flying very low using relatively</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.990" end="00:04:44.730" style="s2">inexpensive equipment to do it you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.750" end="00:04:47.640" style="s2">do it with GPS you can do it with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.730" end="00:04:49.850" style="s2">know staggering the launch so the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.640" end="00:04:51.810" style="s2">drones come in you know every minute or</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.850" end="00:04:55.290" style="s2">simultaneously from different directions</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.810" end="00:04:57.390" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we know you have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.290" end="00:04:59.160" style="s2">classic asymmetric warfare as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.390" end="00:05:01.080" style="s2">understood it these drones were maybe 10</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.160" end="00:05:02.790" style="s2">or 20 thousand dollars each something</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.080" end="00:05:04.590" style="s2">like that and whether they shoot bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.790" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">in 28 of them something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.590" end="00:05:08.700" style="s2">you&#39;re talking you know less than a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:10.050" style="s2">million dollars and you know if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.700" end="00:05:11.880" style="s2">followed it up with a couple of more</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.050" end="00:05:15.540" style="s2">they could have completely disrupted the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.880" end="00:05:17.310" style="s2">oil economy right oh yeah exactly uh you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.540" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">know the oil the oil market obviously is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.310" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">is it very inelastic market and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:23.400" style="s2">market and elasticity means that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:26.190" style="s2">know once you get into a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.400" end="00:05:28.470" style="s2">shortage the prices can go way up</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.190" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">because people continue to buy they</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.470" end="00:05:33.210" style="s2">don&#39;t have the ability to switch it out</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:35.580" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been in a surplus for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.210" end="00:05:37.050" style="s2">while and to have this kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.580" end="00:05:38.790" style="s2">off you know five and a half million</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.050" end="00:05:41.370" style="s2">barrels a day of production taken off</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.790" end="00:05:43.140" style="s2">the table instantaneously put us right</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.370" end="00:05:45.960" style="s2">into that you know edge of shortage</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.140" end="00:05:47.970" style="s2">condition so any more loss would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.960" end="00:05:49.830" style="s2">shot the price up well over a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.970" end="00:05:51.480" style="s2">bucks and the last time that happened</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.830" end="00:05:53.300" style="s2">you know we had the global recession</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.480" end="00:05:55.290" style="s2">that kicked off the financial collapse</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.300" end="00:05:58.170" style="s2">yeah and if remember the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.290" end="00:05:59.700" style="s2">about the commodities explosion in 2007</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.170" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">it led to revolutions all across the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.700" end="00:06:05.220" style="s2">Middle East right right yeah oh yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">kinds of second-order effects so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.220" end="00:06:08.700" style="s2">was the failure mode I mean not only did</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:11.640" style="s2">it were there us assets in the area but</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.700" end="00:06:13.710" style="s2">the Saudis spend vastly more than let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.640" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">say the Iranians do on defense how could</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.710" end="00:06:16.680" style="s2">this happen well I mean they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">any drone defense but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.680" end="00:06:21.720" style="s2">the asymmetry you know you you can have</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:24.990" style="s2">drones coming in from Iraq and from</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.720" end="00:06:27.060" style="s2">Yemen and from opponents that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.990" end="00:06:29.040" style="s2">anticipate having to fight or at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.060" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">at that distance I mean we had some</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.040" end="00:06:32.580" style="s2">warning I mean Yemenis had attacked</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:34.350" style="s2">other facilities they attacked the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.580" end="00:06:36.230" style="s2">east-west pipeline just a couple months</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.350" end="00:06:39.390" style="s2">prior you know a pumping facility</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.230" end="00:06:41.129" style="s2">successfully using drones so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.390" end="00:06:43.499" style="s2">warning that this was occur but</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.129" end="00:06:45.539" style="s2">you know this is classic systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.499" end="00:06:47.879" style="s2">disruption is it&#39;s hitting critical</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.539" end="00:06:50.580" style="s2">nodes in these big networks that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.879" end="00:06:52.139" style="s2">depend on and causing all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.580" end="00:06:55.289" style="s2">cascades of failure and there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.139" end="00:06:56.729" style="s2">not a easy way to fix that in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.289" end="00:06:58.229" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s a a good way to fix</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.729" end="00:07:00.209" style="s2">it at all you just have to reduce your</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.229" end="00:07:03.209" style="s2">dependency on those networks many other</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.209" end="00:07:05.939" style="s2">thing of course a truism in military</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.209" end="00:07:07.889" style="s2">history is militaries tend to fight the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.939" end="00:07:10.050" style="s2">last war right so they have the aegis</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.889" end="00:07:12.659" style="s2">ships out there and the Gulf looking to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.050" end="00:07:14.669" style="s2">shoot down f-14s or something but</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.659" end="00:07:16.259" style="s2">instead come tiny little drones flying</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.669" end="00:07:18.449" style="s2">low and slow oops</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.259" end="00:07:20.819" style="s2">our you know billion-dollar Aegis ships</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.449" end="00:07:22.229" style="s2">can&#39;t even deal with those right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.819" end="00:07:23.909" style="s2">great the other hand if someone had</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.229" end="00:07:26.069" style="s2">actually been forwardly thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.909" end="00:07:28.169" style="s2">said well wait a minute let&#39;s wargame</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.069" end="00:07:30.149" style="s2">this out asymmetric drone warfare is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.169" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">gonna be an obvious thing you know we</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.149" end="00:07:34.679" style="s2">could have spent vastly smaller sums and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:37.139" style="s2">built counter drone systems you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.679" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">more point defense because fortunately</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.139" end="00:07:41.249" style="s2">drones are slow and they&#39;re not stealthy</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:43.289" style="s2">at least the ones that were used here so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.249" end="00:07:45.509" style="s2">if you rang the facility with point</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.289" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">defence weapons with high granular radar</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.509" end="00:07:49.259" style="s2">practically shot them all down for not a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:51.240" style="s2">whole lot of money well it actually may</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.259" end="00:07:52.769" style="s2">end up being more expensive to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.240" end="00:07:55.050" style="s2">all the you know the point defense</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.769" end="00:07:57.929" style="s2">effort because you have to defend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.050" end="00:07:59.699" style="s2">of different points and there&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.929" end="00:08:01.769" style="s2">can&#39;t get the economies of scale you get</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.699" end="00:08:04.019" style="s2">on these systems with you know hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.769" end="00:08:05.849" style="s2">of miles of range yeah that&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.019" end="00:08:08.279" style="s2">on the other hand for a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.849" end="00:08:10.050" style="s2">very vulnerable and ultra high-value</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.279" end="00:08:11.279" style="s2">ones like the oil facility it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.050" end="00:08:13.079" style="s2">lot of sense right probably not going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.279" end="00:08:14.969" style="s2">defend every government office building</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.079" end="00:08:17.099" style="s2">interesting where do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.969" end="00:08:18.119" style="s2">attack came from did it come from Yemen</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.099" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">did it come from</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.119" end="00:08:25.349" style="s2">Orion or do we know yet um combination I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:28.949" style="s2">think of an attack from Yemen and from</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.349" end="00:08:32.009" style="s2">Iraq from Iraq yeah there&#39;s the Iranians</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.949" end="00:08:34.709" style="s2">staged an attack from Iraq ah okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.009" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">so yeah there wasn&#39;t any real easy way</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.709" end="00:08:37.380" style="s2">to detect it unless you were looking in</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.060" end="00:08:40.409" style="s2">those directions of course they should</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.380" end="00:08:41.969" style="s2">have been but they were Pearl Harbor all</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.409" end="00:08:43.829" style="s2">over again all right should have but</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.969" end="00:08:45.329" style="s2">they didn&#39;t for the Saudis that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.829" end="00:08:47.310" style="s2">definitely was Pearl Harbor I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.329" end="00:08:49.199" style="s2">really the big impact on them is that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.310" end="00:08:51.870" style="s2">really screwed with their IPO yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.199" end="00:08:53.000" style="s2">they&#39;re taking a ramp go public and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.870" end="00:08:54.530" style="s2">know edit</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.000" end="00:08:56.990" style="s2">two trillion-dollar offering in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.530" end="00:08:59.270" style="s2">easily slammed half a trillion off of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.990" end="00:09:00.950" style="s2">that or more because now the system is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:02.600" style="s2">actually shown to be vulnerable and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.950" end="00:09:04.550" style="s2">they&#39;re incapable of defending it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.600" end="00:09:06.830" style="s2">yeah and from bigger perspective it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.550" end="00:09:08.870" style="s2">ought to substantially undercut you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.830" end="00:09:11.140" style="s2">their the whole position of the Saudi</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.870" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">regime you know the world&#39;s last</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.140" end="00:09:15.950" style="s2">absolute monarchy right right in feudal</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:18.440" style="s2">empire right get rid of them sons of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.950" end="00:09:20.030" style="s2">bitches right but and this you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.440" end="00:09:22.580" style="s2">shows the world that they can be taken</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.030" end="00:09:24.860" style="s2">down easily right so probably the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.580" end="00:09:26.840" style="s2">Iranians and other folks have said all</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:28.370" style="s2">right when the day comes and we decide</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.840" end="00:09:30.590" style="s2">we really want to take the Saudis out</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.370" end="00:09:32.660" style="s2">we&#39;ll just knock all their oil off leave</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.590" end="00:09:35.050" style="s2">it out for a year or two just constant</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.660" end="00:09:36.650" style="s2">marine of these damn things right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.050" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">nothing to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.650" end="00:09:41.300" style="s2">you know that&#39;s gonna as you say gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:43.400" style="s2">very much reduce the interest of other</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.300" end="00:09:45.410" style="s2">people and investing large sums of money</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.400" end="00:09:48.170" style="s2">into that area at least along as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.410" end="00:09:49.940" style="s2">Saudi regime remains in power yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.170" end="00:09:53.060" style="s2">also kind of exposed that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.940" end="00:09:54.200" style="s2">the u.s. really isn&#39;t as interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.060" end="00:09:55.850" style="s2">the Middle East as they used to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.200" end="00:09:58.370" style="s2">because we produce so much oil</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.850" end="00:10:00.650" style="s2">absolutely and has changed our</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.370" end="00:10:02.120" style="s2">perspective I mean we made the strategic</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.650" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">error a grand strategic error of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.120" end="00:10:06.710" style="s2">focusing on the Middle East as a primary</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:10.280" style="s2">hot spot as something that we should and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.710" end="00:10:12.410" style="s2">needed to actively engage with back in</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.280" end="00:10:14.210" style="s2">at the end of the Cold War you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.410" end="00:10:15.560" style="s2">largely based on projections that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.210" end="00:10:17.540" style="s2">weren&#39;t going to be able to produce oil</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.560" end="00:10:20.390" style="s2">and that the oil market would continue</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.540" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">to contract due to Chinese demand</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.390" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">ramping up and that the US production</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:29.180" style="s2">was over and that was completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:33.080" style="s2">reversed about halfway through the Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.180" end="00:10:36.350" style="s2">war proven to be false and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.080" end="00:10:39.140" style="s2">initial strategic decision has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.350" end="00:10:41.089" style="s2">yielding nothing but damage to the US</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.140" end="00:10:43.400" style="s2">since then they are the forever wars</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.089" end="00:10:45.770" style="s2">right what a stupid ideas wrecked though</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.400" end="00:10:48.650" style="s2">one question about that why is there</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.770" end="00:10:50.510" style="s2">been no response to the Iranian attack</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.650" end="00:10:53.270" style="s2">you know Trump was all huffing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.510" end="00:10:56.540" style="s2">puffing then didn&#39;t do anything um I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.270" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">think Trump is he&#39;s very big on rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.540" end="00:11:00.910" style="s2">is particularly when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:04.280" style="s2">international engagements but he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.910" end="00:11:04.840" style="s2">negative on getting engaged in a foreign</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.280" end="00:11:07.000" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.840" end="00:11:08.890" style="s2">he just shied away from it but I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.000" end="00:11:11.830" style="s2">think that the Saudis that didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.890" end="00:11:16.120" style="s2">to increase attentions they didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.830" end="00:11:19.690" style="s2">to engage in a full-scale war with Iran</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.120" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">while fighting in in Yemen while trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.690" end="00:11:24.010" style="s2">to you know refinance basically the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.960" style="s2">Kingdom by going you know going to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.010" end="00:11:28.630" style="s2">public markets they would have totally</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.960" end="00:11:30.700" style="s2">tanked that for as long as he as long as</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.630" end="00:11:32.620" style="s2">we could project so you know the Saudis</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.700" end="00:11:34.779" style="s2">saying no and then and then Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.620" end="00:11:38.620" style="s2">natural inclination he&#39;s he&#39;s placed</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.779" end="00:11:41.080" style="s2">trade strategy ahead of national</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.620" end="00:11:44.980" style="s2">security strategy used to trade used to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.080" end="00:11:46.900" style="s2">be just a you know slave to the national</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.980" end="00:11:48.460" style="s2">security you know whatever was best in</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.900" end="00:11:51.130" style="s2">terms of you know the security of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.460" end="00:11:53.589" style="s2">global system we we let the the trade</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.130" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">strategy accommodate that and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.589" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">reversed that relationship national</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:01.540" style="s2">security is now and enthralled to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:04.270" style="s2">the trade strategy whatever improves our</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.540" end="00:12:07.180" style="s2">trade status yeah like a current example</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.270" end="00:12:09.339" style="s2">I if it&#39;s true I think it probably is is</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.180" end="00:12:11.830" style="s2">that Trump gave assurances to the</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.180" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">let&#39;s change directions here a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.500" end="00:13:16.390" style="s2">bit move up the stack in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:18.710" style="s2">conceptual stuff you&#39;ve popularized the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.390" end="00:13:21.620" style="s2">terms the resistance and the insurgent</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.620" end="00:13:24.920" style="s2">and compare the two is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:26.870" style="s2">interacting systems could you briefly</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.920" end="00:13:28.850" style="s2">describe them and tell us how those</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.870" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">movements are impacting our political</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.850" end="00:13:34.100" style="s2">situation today okay well the concept is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:36.500" style="s2">is that the American political scene is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.100" end="00:13:38.420" style="s2">now the battleground between two social</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.330" end="00:13:45.740" style="s2">process started with the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.730" end="00:13:48.380" style="s2">which is the rejection of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.740" end="00:13:52.790" style="s2">establishment that bolted and put Trump</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.380" end="00:13:56.810" style="s2">into office the insurgency is a maneuver</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.790" end="00:14:00.140" style="s2">based insurgency it disrupts systems it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.810" end="00:14:02.360" style="s2">causes chaos and because of that chaos</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.140" end="00:14:05.210" style="s2">it disrupts the decision-making process</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.360" end="00:14:07.970" style="s2">of of the opposition the established</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.210" end="00:14:10.460" style="s2">opposition as well as any Network</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:12.440" style="s2">opposition and it&#39;s been fairly</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.460" end="00:14:14.410" style="s2">effective I mean they put Trump in</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.440" end="00:14:19.370" style="s2">office it&#39;s maintaining his popularity</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.410" end="00:14:22.400" style="s2">Trump is a natural in terms of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.370" end="00:14:24.470" style="s2">of maneuver based disruptive strategies</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.400" end="00:14:26.780" style="s2">he has a lots of what got what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.470" end="00:14:28.430" style="s2">a fast transiency moves from one topic</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.780" end="00:14:30.530" style="s2">to the next one disruption to the next</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.430" end="00:14:33.290" style="s2">there&#39;s never really any time for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.530" end="00:14:35.690" style="s2">the opposition to get build a momentum</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.290" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">in terms of opposition on any specific</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.690" end="00:14:42.020" style="s2">point the resistance is the network</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:45.710" style="s2">that&#39;s been most effective at combating</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.020" end="00:14:48.110" style="s2">the insurgency and it found it</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.710" end="00:14:51.740" style="s2">it&#39;s purchased in in the identity side</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.110" end="00:14:55.000" style="s2">very values focused its puritanical in</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.740" end="00:14:59.300" style="s2">many respects doesn&#39;t put up with</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.000" end="00:15:00.770" style="s2">violations of values and it&#39;s in the</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.770" end="00:15:06.110" style="s2">Party and you know we&#39;re seeing the kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.710" end="00:15:07.970" style="s2">of compromised mainstream candidates</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.110" end="00:15:10.790" style="s2">being a you know throw it to the side</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.970" end="00:15:13.160" style="s2">like Biden and anyone who is like who</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.790" end="00:15:16.070" style="s2">would try to straddle the middle ground</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.160" end="00:15:19.940" style="s2">AOC for instance is you know the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.070" end="00:15:23.030" style="s2">example of of the resistance fighter the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.940" end="00:15:25.730" style="s2">resistance participant and both of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.030" end="00:15:28.010" style="s2">networks are open source meaning there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.730" end="00:15:30.770" style="s2">not any one specific person that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.010" end="00:15:32.630" style="s2">leader those those people that you see</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.770" end="00:15:34.390" style="s2">at the front tend to be more like</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.630" end="00:15:36.680" style="s2">a weaponized version of the network</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.390" end="00:15:38.780" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of you know conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.680" end="00:15:41.390" style="s2">ideas within these open-source networks</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.780" end="00:15:44.270" style="s2">but there are you know all agreed on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.390" end="00:15:46.340" style="s2">single you know animating purpose so</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.270" end="00:15:48.530" style="s2">that you know that&#39;s just there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.340" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">core of the idea yeah let&#39;s talk a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.530" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">little bit about these networks right we</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:54.560" style="s2">can over and on Facebook we have a group</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:56.570" style="s2">called rally point alpha I think you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.560" end="00:15:59.150" style="s2">remember that aren&#39;t you John mm-hmm I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.570" end="00:16:01.220" style="s2">a manager of it I guess ah okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.150" end="00:16:04.130" style="s2">the that&#39;s right that&#39;s a group where we</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.220" end="00:16:05.240" style="s2">based on an essay by Jordan Hall a group</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.130" end="00:16:06.970" style="s2">of us have gotten together and talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.240" end="00:16:10.550" style="s2">about how collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.970" end="00:16:12.350" style="s2">networks decentralized networks have</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.550" end="00:16:14.180" style="s2">really completely changed the game or at</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.350" end="00:16:15.890" style="s2">least they&#39;ve changed it yet but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.180" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">in the process of changing the game</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.890" end="00:16:19.910" style="s2">right could you talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:24.130" style="s2">the nature of these networks and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.910" end="00:16:27.980" style="s2">started looking at networks as a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.130" end="00:16:30.760" style="s2">kind of organizational framework after</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.980" end="00:16:33.290" style="s2">the Iraq invasion I was seeing results</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.760" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">coming from from that engagement that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.290" end="00:16:36.770" style="s2">weren&#39;t fitting you know the the media</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.870" style="s2">narratives or the analytical narratives</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.770" end="00:16:40.970" style="s2">coming out of the establishment so um</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.870" end="00:16:42.470" style="s2">what I saw was something similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.970" end="00:16:45.410" style="s2">I was seeing on the Internet it was an</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.470" end="00:16:47.590" style="s2">open source framework were lots of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.410" end="00:16:51.890" style="s2">disparate groups come together to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.590" end="00:16:54.020" style="s2">operate as a single unit but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.890" end="00:16:57.140" style="s2">only tied together through what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.020" end="00:17:01.070" style="s2">a plausible promise or the idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.140" end="00:17:02.960" style="s2">one single simple goal that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.070" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">agree on often it&#39;s like no more</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.960" end="00:17:09.819" style="s2">corruption or remove this specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">leader in Iraq there were you know 70</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.819" end="00:17:14.329" style="s2">different groups lots of very very small</p>

<p begin="00:17:23.089" end="00:17:28.550" style="s2">seem to be able to work together</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.439" end="00:17:31.640" style="s2">effectively by focusing on rejecting the</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.300" end="00:17:43.880" style="s2">that to the side one one thing we saw</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.510" end="00:17:45.980" style="s2">with open source networks like this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.880" end="00:17:48.050" style="s2">that they&#39;re extremely innovative</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.980" end="00:17:50.600" style="s2">at least in the in the Iraq war they did</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.050" end="00:17:52.460" style="s2">more in six months and the Irish</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.600" end="00:17:55.250" style="s2">Republican Army did in 20 years in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.460" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">of innovation it was very very quick we</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.250" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">had a three billion dollar program for</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:01.880" style="s2">counter a IEDs</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.880" end="00:18:06.470" style="s2">countered our counter within two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.620" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">and our release schedule was every three</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.470" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">months to six months so they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.860" style="s2">beating us very quickly and they shared</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:15.950" style="s2">those innovations there wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.860" end="00:18:18.680" style="s2">any you know lockdown I&#39;m gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.950" end="00:18:20.840" style="s2">this for my my own group they shared it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.680" end="00:18:22.910" style="s2">freely among each other each group was</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.840" end="00:18:25.670" style="s2">able to copy what the other group did</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.910" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">and apply it very quickly and there was</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.930" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">carry the food back that chemical trail</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.120" end="00:18:48.470" style="s2">acts as a signal for other ants to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:49.910" style="s2">follow and find the food and each ant</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.470" end="00:18:52.010" style="s2">that does that adds more chemicals to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.910" end="00:18:55.490" style="s2">that trail until the food is exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.010" end="00:18:57.230" style="s2">and in the case of an open-source</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.490" end="00:18:59.480" style="s2">insurgency you know every group that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.230" end="00:19:01.310" style="s2">made a successful attack either by</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.480" end="00:19:03.500" style="s2">innovating on the target selection or</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.310" end="00:19:07.270" style="s2">innovating on that on the method of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.500" end="00:19:09.470" style="s2">attack had it covered in the press and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.270" end="00:19:11.810" style="s2">had it covered you know through online</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.470" end="00:19:15.140" style="s2">coverage you know self posting often</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.810" end="00:19:16.520" style="s2">through their own videos and that served</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.140" end="00:19:19.160" style="s2">as kind of a chemical trail that this</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.520" end="00:19:23.030" style="s2">target was now available for attack this</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.160" end="00:19:25.580" style="s2">method works and then everyone else can</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.030" end="00:19:27.560" style="s2">copy it and they copied it until it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.580" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t work and they moved on to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.560" end="00:19:32.780" style="s2">next innovation so there&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:35.660" style="s2">attributes of open-source groups and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.780" end="00:19:37.400" style="s2">they innovate and how they organized its</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.660" end="00:19:39.680" style="s2">if you can get your head around that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.400" end="00:19:41.750" style="s2">kind of core structure it makes</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.680" end="00:19:43.580" style="s2">understanding what the resistance in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.750" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">and the you know present-day insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.580" end="00:19:47.300" style="s2">looks like and how they operate how did</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:49.820" style="s2">you could you couldn&#39;t take that model</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.300" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">on that now remap it to say the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.820" end="00:19:55.100" style="s2">emergence of the insurgency in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:19:59.370" style="s2">in 2016 yeah so uh you know what we saw</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.100" end="00:20:01.170" style="s2">in kind of the Trump insurgency was that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.370" end="00:20:03.450" style="s2">you know Trump was put up forward as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.170" end="00:20:06.020" style="s2">weapon he was really good at you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.450" end="00:20:07.860" style="s2">disrupting things but there were</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.020" end="00:20:11.580" style="s2">hundreds of different subgroups</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.860" end="00:20:13.140" style="s2">supporting that campaign and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.580" end="00:20:15.780" style="s2">constantly innovating I mean you had</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.140" end="00:20:17.640" style="s2">like even though that reddit group that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.780" end="00:20:20.250" style="s2">that pro-trump reddit group and they had</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.640" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">300,000 members I was interviewed on</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.250" end="00:20:26.910" style="s2">that just a week after Trump was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:29.309" style="s2">kind of interesting all of these groups</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.910" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">were all coming up with different types</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.309" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">of memes different types of angles of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:35.550" style="s2">attack on different aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:38.010" style="s2">Democratic strategy constantly coming up</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:44.070" style="s2">was going on at the on the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.590" end="00:20:46.470" style="s2">side and the Democrats were the classic</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.070" end="00:20:50.370" style="s2">bureaucracy they you know they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.470" end="00:20:52.470" style="s2">spending gobs of money on media and in a</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.590" end="00:21:05.010" style="s2">they had huge databases but they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.710" end="00:21:06.570" style="s2">all tightly bound up and centrally</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.010" end="00:21:09.210" style="s2">controlled and even with all the media</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.570" end="00:21:10.920" style="s2">on their on their side you know</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.920" end="00:21:15.210" style="s2">insurgency was still able to route</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.450" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">around it that&#39;s why I mean is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.210" end="00:21:19.860" style="s2">reason why that the the Russian effort</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:22.260" style="s2">as ham-handed as it was and and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.860" end="00:21:24.840" style="s2">diffuses it was was you know able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.260" end="00:21:26.490" style="s2">slot right in you know it was just one</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.840" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">member out of the hundreds that were</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.490" end="00:21:31.830" style="s2">participating in in the insurgency and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:34.440" style="s2">that if something was successful if</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.830" end="00:21:36.390" style="s2">something had some legs in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.440" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">new idea a new angle of attack a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.390" end="00:21:41.160" style="s2">disruption Trump was really good at</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:43.470" style="s2">taking it out and then elevating it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.160" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">using it in his tweet stream then I</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.470" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">would echo back to these things and be</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:49.830" style="s2">upregulated the group you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:52.470" style="s2">about on read it&#39;s called the Donald I</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.830" end="00:21:54.929" style="s2">believe right yeah the Donald yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.470" end="00:21:57.450" style="s2">built the system a couple years back</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.929" end="00:21:58.860" style="s2">that parsed the Donald in real-time and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.450" end="00:22:01.140" style="s2">ran it through a bunch of analytical</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.860" end="00:22:03.090" style="s2">software and sorted memes and showed</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.140" end="00:22:04.470" style="s2">trend lines and all that because I had</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.090" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">determined that the Donald was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.470" end="00:22:08.490" style="s2">convergence point for the what you would</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.230" style="s2">call the insurgency network yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.490" end="00:22:12.030" style="s2">relatively few memes were actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.230" end="00:22:13.350" style="s2">invented on the Donald but it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.030" end="00:22:14.700" style="s2">they were propagated</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.350" end="00:22:16.650" style="s2">and where they got validity so things</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.700" end="00:22:19.169" style="s2">would be cooked up in 4chan or ei-chan</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.650" end="00:22:21.870" style="s2">or in wackier places than that people</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.169" end="00:22:23.340" style="s2">would post them to the donald and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.870" end="00:22:27.030" style="s2">they got uploaded there then they might</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.340" end="00:22:28.890" style="s2">get picked up by Infowars or Breitbart</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.030" end="00:22:30.870" style="s2">or even and then from there they go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.890" end="00:22:33.330" style="s2">Fox News then try to pick them up and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.870" end="00:22:35.700" style="s2">then he broadcasts them and then up</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.330" end="00:22:37.740" style="s2">regulates that whole message and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.700" end="00:22:39.179" style="s2">there&#39;s themes and variations on every</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.740" end="00:22:42.030" style="s2">new invention so it&#39;s very much an</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.179" end="00:22:44.160" style="s2">evolutionary fast-tracking kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.030" end="00:22:46.020" style="s2">system as you were describing exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.160" end="00:22:48.059" style="s2">exactly you know you throw it against</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.020" end="00:22:50.190" style="s2">the wall and see what sticks but but</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.059" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">there is a but there is a network</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.190" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">structure it&#39;s not just completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:56.190" style="s2">chaotic you know there are convergent</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:58.289" style="s2">zones there are amplifiers</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">there&#39;s the maximum amplifier which was</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.289" end="00:23:03.150" style="s2">Trump&#39;s tweet stream and it somehow you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:06.690" style="s2">know came together and worked good</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.150" end="00:23:09.059" style="s2">enough is the insurgency still existing</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.690" end="00:23:12.150" style="s2">that is it still improving or is it kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.059" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">of done its thing and in a senile State</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.150" end="00:23:15.929" style="s2">these days well I mean a disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:18.659" style="s2">insurgency typically has to have an</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.929" end="00:23:20.520" style="s2">enemy to focus on all right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.659" end="00:23:22.110" style="s2">what we saw in at least in regular</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.520" end="00:23:24.390" style="s2">warfare we also saw it in the big you</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.110" end="00:23:27.059" style="s2">know open source protests that you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.390" end="00:23:29.400" style="s2">swept the Islamic world we saw just</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.059" end="00:23:30.780" style="s2">recently with the in Puerto Rico and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.400" end="00:23:33.090" style="s2">other open source protests that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.780" end="00:23:35.850" style="s2">successful is that it has to have an</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.850" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">to focus all their efforts on um so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.580" end="00:23:43.530" style="s2">been in largely dormant you know since</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:46.130" style="s2">the election and I start ramping up</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.130" end="00:23:51.210" style="s2">regardless I&#39;d still been successful</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.559" end="00:23:53.370" style="s2">enough to allow Trump to still have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.210" end="00:23:54.570" style="s2">forty four percent approval rating yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.370" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">now the resistance</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.140" end="00:27:14.130" style="s2">they&#39;d searches who doesn&#39;t work as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.309" end="00:27:16.620" style="s2">on Twitter as the resistance it&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.620" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re moving what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.360" end="00:27:21.029" style="s2">you know through their conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:23.190" style="s2">they move towards a consensus on a</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.190" end="00:27:26.700" style="s2">value and when they reach that consensus</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.590" end="00:27:29.340" style="s2">then they enforce it</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.700" end="00:27:31.230" style="s2">it&#39;s consensus seeking which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.340" end="00:27:33.690" style="s2">different from the insurgency I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.230" end="00:27:35.100" style="s2">that if you had the I just was in the</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.490" end="00:27:43.380" style="s2">this new political spectrum is that you</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.750" end="00:27:51.049" style="s2">which is the resistance and then on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.330" end="00:27:54.090" style="s2">other side you have this disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.049" end="00:27:58.409" style="s2">capability and they&#39;re in tension and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.090" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">you know the network that&#39;s driving the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.409" end="00:28:01.470" style="s2">this this new value system has the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:03.570" style="s2">ability to reach into all the old</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.570" end="00:28:07.890" style="s2">individual level and and set them in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.340" end="00:28:10.830" style="s2">you know in a very specific direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.890" end="00:28:15.179" style="s2">and the disruptive capability comes in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.830" end="00:28:17.640" style="s2">and if those if that value system is too</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.179" end="00:28:20.220" style="s2">restrictive or pointing in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.640" end="00:28:24.059" style="s2">direction the the insurgency would</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.220" end="00:28:29.190" style="s2">disrupt it and cause it to reset itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.059" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">or go back to a an earlier stage you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.190" end="00:28:32.730" style="s2">follow me on that absolutely in fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a perfect transition to my next</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.730" end="00:28:36.929" style="s2">point you&#39;ve written quite a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:39.990" style="s2">coherence right and especially about the</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.990" end="00:28:44.039" style="s2">know frankly I&#39;m coming more and more to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.610" end="00:28:46.710" style="s2">believe that an unconscious libido for</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.710" end="00:28:51.480" style="s2">field that&#39;s driving a lot of our social</p>

<p begin="00:28:51.480" end="00:28:54.390" style="s2">resonates with that a lot right the</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.390" end="00:29:00.360" style="s2">is people who unconsciously are starved</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.750" end="00:29:20.280" style="s2">right it&#39;s a new brand of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.360" end="00:29:21.900" style="s2">a coherence is very powerful if we look</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.280" end="00:29:24.870" style="s2">at you know work from people like Peter</p>

<p begin="00:29:35.730" end="00:29:40.830" style="s2">coherence that would seem to indicate</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.950" end="00:29:43.140" style="s2">that in a fight resistance might have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.830" end="00:29:46.290" style="s2">advantage over insurgency if resistance</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.140" end="00:29:49.380" style="s2">is based on coherence and insurgency</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.800" end="00:29:58.620" style="s2">value stability over everything else so</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:01.050" style="s2">if you had to draw the political</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.620" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">spectrum at a global scale you would</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.050" end="00:30:05.160" style="s2">have China on one side and Russia on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:07.920" style="s2">other China is obviously you know more</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.160" end="00:30:11.160" style="s2">successful but it&#39;s just started to lock</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.920" end="00:30:13.920" style="s2">down process and if they achieve total</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.160" end="00:30:15.510" style="s2">coherence and totally enforced by their</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.920" end="00:30:18.540" style="s2">social credit system and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.510" end="00:30:21.540" style="s2">like you can see the stagnation threat</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.540" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">there where no new ideas are allowed</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.540" end="00:30:25.950" style="s2">because they can violate or disrupt the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:27.540" style="s2">status on the other hand do you know too</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.950" end="00:30:31.860" style="s2">much disruption you end up you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.540" end="00:30:33.480" style="s2">corrupt like Russia org Trump yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.860" end="00:30:35.540" style="s2">see exactly the same battle here in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.480" end="00:30:39.810" style="s2">US you have the kind of this Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.540" end="00:30:42.870" style="s2">value lock down on the one side and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.810" end="00:30:44.820" style="s2">you see this kind of corrupt disruption</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.870" end="00:30:46.110" style="s2">on the other side I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.820" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">actually a benefit I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.110" end="00:30:51.660" style="s2">actually the best place to be is at that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:54.030" style="s2">edge that dynamic edge between the two</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.660" end="00:30:57.660" style="s2">and that will allow us to maintain them</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.030" end="00:31:01.080" style="s2">the maximum creativity without falling</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.660" end="00:31:02.910" style="s2">completely apart going forward whereas</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.080" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">the other sides are you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.910" end="00:31:07.320" style="s2">gonna they&#39;re screwed yeah the Russians</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">have lost all our innovative capacity</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.320" end="00:31:10.230" style="s2">through pure</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:11.460" style="s2">option right there&#39;s right no way for</p>

<p begin="00:31:11.460" end="00:31:15.870" style="s2">it stolen essentially and as you point</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.890" end="00:31:18.330" style="s2">out we&#39;ll go on to the Chinese here next</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.870" end="00:31:21.570" style="s2">but the other Chinese face the potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.330" end="00:31:23.820" style="s2">risk of becoming stultifyingly coherent</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.570" end="00:31:25.289" style="s2">right and right in fact I have a term I</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.180" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">kind of decision-making system and how</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.450" end="00:36:00.500" style="s2">does that work you know and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:03.230" style="s2">finding out that it has two functions</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.500" end="00:36:05.000" style="s2">that can be a disruptive function throw</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.230" end="00:36:08.990" style="s2">things into chaos and and that it could</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.000" end="00:36:11.000" style="s2">also can set consensus or come to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.990" end="00:36:13.880" style="s2">consensus on values on new sets of</p>

<p begin="00:36:13.880" end="00:36:17.390" style="s2">reach down into organizations into</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.470" end="00:36:19.160" style="s2">bureaucracies and the big battle being</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.390" end="00:36:23.030" style="s2">in the future they&#39;ll be able to reach</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.160" end="00:36:24.859" style="s2">down into a corporate land and force</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.030" end="00:36:26.630" style="s2">corporate compliance these value systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.859" end="00:36:28.070" style="s2">and presumably they&#39;ll be competing ones</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.630" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">and maybe you know we have now the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.070" end="00:36:33.080" style="s2">resistance is taking that form but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:35.720" style="s2">would seem natural that there will have</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.080" end="00:36:38.180" style="s2">to be a other side to that so there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.720" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">be at least two and probably more than</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.180" end="00:36:42.109" style="s2">that</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.730" end="00:36:47.570" style="s2">gonna be to China and the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:50.869" style="s2">world well I was thinking even within</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.570" end="00:36:53.330" style="s2">our society right oh no I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.869" end="00:36:57.260" style="s2">they can last I mean the these networks</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.330" end="00:36:59.089" style="s2">tend to be they tend to expand and crush</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.260" end="00:37:02.660" style="s2">any opposition within their space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.089" end="00:37:05.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see it I</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.660" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">think I think the the overall direction</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.869" end="00:37:09.619" style="s2">and this is like another McLuhan thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:11.690" style="s2">is that we&#39;re headed towards this you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.619" end="00:37:13.400" style="s2">know grand consolidation at a at a you</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.690" end="00:37:15.619" style="s2">know at a network a global network level</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.400" end="00:37:17.290" style="s2">and that you know all of this fighting</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.619" end="00:37:19.339" style="s2">that we&#39;re going through and and in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.290" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">struggle that we&#39;re seeing over the long</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.339" end="00:37:24.080" style="s2">over the next couple decades will be</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">about which system ends up becoming the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.080" end="00:37:27.650" style="s2">dominant one I wonder if that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:29.630" style="s2">true let me if we take a look at recent</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.650" end="00:37:31.849" style="s2">history if we look at the nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.630" end="00:37:34.609" style="s2">they&#39;ve been breaking down into smaller</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.849" end="00:37:36.230" style="s2">and smaller units right because of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.609" end="00:37:38.869" style="s2">bureaucracies less effective in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.230" end="00:37:40.490" style="s2">complex environment yeah and also I</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.869" end="00:37:42.560" style="s2">think people are looking for coherence</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.490" end="00:37:44.660" style="s2">also because my other argument why do</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.560" end="00:37:47.810" style="s2">the Scots want to get away from</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.660" end="00:37:50.030" style="s2">the UK why do you know why is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.810" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">Catalonians so insistent on breaking</p>

<p begin="00:37:53.090" end="00:37:57.710" style="s2">years but that&#39;s a lot that&#39;s doable</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.550" end="00:37:59.060" style="s2">because there is now a network component</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.710" end="00:38:00.260" style="s2">that can allow them to interact them and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.060" end="00:38:03.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a EU granted there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.260" end="00:38:05.000" style="s2">intermediary step there but it being</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.260" end="00:38:07.310" style="s2">part of the same network allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.000" end="00:38:09.170" style="s2">fragment at the nation-state level they</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.310" end="00:38:10.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be as big yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.170" end="00:38:13.490" style="s2">still be coherent still be able to talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.820" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">to each other as as friends as part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.490" end="00:38:17.810" style="s2">the same unit yeah you have to have like</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:19.130" style="s2">a minimum standards of interconnect</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.810" end="00:38:20.840" style="s2">think of it as the you know the internet</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.130" end="00:38:23.270" style="s2">it&#39;s like these minimum standards</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.840" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">allowed the whole network to assemble</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.270" end="00:38:27.890" style="s2">you have to have the same value system</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:29.480" style="s2">as a minimum standard in order to to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.890" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">work together and you can fragment the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.480" end="00:38:33.110" style="s2">nation-states down to nothing done to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:36.130" style="s2">micro levels and if you have that same</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.110" end="00:38:38.690" style="s2">value set it allows that to happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.130" end="00:38:40.130" style="s2">coherently and actually if maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.690" end="00:38:43.010" style="s2">economically efficiently because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.130" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">networks can correct replace many of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.010" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">things the nation-state was doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">economically not everything but many of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">the things so a nation-state of five</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:53.690" style="s2">million people is now quite feasible</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:55.910" style="s2">right yeah and also that the network</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.690" end="00:38:59.720" style="s2">allows you to love these small states to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.910" end="00:39:02.330" style="s2">avoid becoming you know prey to large</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.720" end="00:39:04.280" style="s2">multinational corporations to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.330" end="00:39:06.950" style="s2">it&#39;s you know these networks have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.280" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">ability to change the policy or change</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.950" end="00:39:11.630" style="s2">the alignment of large multinationals so</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:13.430" style="s2">if you were running the extinction</p>

<p begin="00:39:13.430" end="00:39:17.450" style="s2">government you&#39;d be picking out a</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.450" end="00:39:21.710" style="s2">into alignment and one month after a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.970" end="00:39:24.170" style="s2">month you know again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.710" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">until they until you have sufficient</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:30.830" style="s2">there&#39;s another good example of an</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.650" end="00:39:32.300" style="s2">emergent coherent group from the Nets is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.830" end="00:39:34.220" style="s2">the extinction rebellion I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.300" end="00:39:37.010" style="s2">saying for some time that one could go a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.220" end="00:39:39.460" style="s2">long long long way I could be the you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.010" end="00:39:41.690" style="s2">know the the unexpected invention of</p>

<p begin="00:39:41.690" end="00:39:46.390" style="s2">twelve random dudes and Galilee changed</p>

<p begin="00:39:48.860" end="00:39:53.570" style="s2">could end up changing the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.190" end="00:39:55.580" style="s2">they&#39;d probably end up folding into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.570" end="00:39:57.970" style="s2">larger you know resistance Network</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.580" end="00:39:59.770" style="s2">whatever that you can call it what</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.970" end="00:40:02.050" style="s2">at that point because it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.770" end="00:40:05.380" style="s2">resistance so much as it is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.050" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">value consensus is that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.380" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">other thing that this that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:14.050" style="s2">battling over is this idea of being able</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">to set the conditions of the AI so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.050" end="00:40:18.250" style="s2">socially eyes that are being developed</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:19.630" style="s2">and I mean the winner sets those</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.250" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">conditions and what I mean by that is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.630" end="00:40:23.470" style="s2">is that what we&#39;re finding with AI at</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:25.450" style="s2">least from my perspective is that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.470" end="00:40:26.950" style="s2">really isn&#39;t really great at producing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.450" end="00:40:29.170" style="s2">human equivalent intelligence I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.950" end="00:40:30.849" style="s2">don&#39;t even properly utilize the you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.170" end="00:40:33.150" style="s2">seven billion people we have right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.849" end="00:40:35.619" style="s2">with the human level intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.150" end="00:40:37.599" style="s2">creating more of that is just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.619" end="00:40:40.510" style="s2">useless activity where it really seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.599" end="00:40:42.430" style="s2">to be shining and based on the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.510" end="00:40:43.990" style="s2">data that&#39;s available and the data is</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.430" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">highly correlated with the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.990" end="00:40:51.550" style="s2">the the AI is a more is better is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:53.380" style="s2">in this social space it&#39;s great at</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.550" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">managing it learns a lot about managing</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.380" end="00:40:56.470" style="s2">the connections between us and was we</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:58.660" style="s2">know in complex systems the connections</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.470" end="00:41:01.599" style="s2">matter more than the individual units so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.660" end="00:41:03.970" style="s2">managing that that connection space is</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.599" end="00:41:06.849" style="s2">what AI is really going to shine at</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.970" end="00:41:08.740" style="s2">doing and we have the potential then to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.849" end="00:41:10.569" style="s2">create social systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.740" end="00:41:12.010" style="s2">technological artifacts and that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.569" end="00:41:15.940" style="s2">have one from China and we&#39;ll have them</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.940" end="00:41:25.660" style="s2">those the goals that this AI is going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.170" end="00:41:28.359" style="s2">try to accomplish or try to you know</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.359" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">be the biggest fight ever I mean you</p>

<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:36.819" style="s2">mean it&#39;s an incredible power if you get</p>

<p begin="00:41:39.579" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">it&#39;s quite a growing suspicion from both</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.460" end="00:41:47.740" style="s2">team red and team blue about the</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.440" end="00:42:49.710" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the safest way to hedge</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.390" end="00:43:29.140" style="s2">obviously from the resistance to kind of</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.140" end="00:43:34.150" style="s2">are written into this AI know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.079" end="00:43:35.350" style="s2">lots of lots of conflict points I the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.150" end="00:43:37.360" style="s2">only the only thing that would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.350" end="00:43:41.650" style="s2">tough for a bottoms-up version of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.360" end="00:43:44.440" style="s2">is the data the way these systems learn</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.650" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">is that they require tons of data they</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.440" end="00:43:49.150" style="s2">don&#39;t work off of you know the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:43:49.150" end="00:43:55.740" style="s2">time through science and you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.630" end="00:43:58.270" style="s2">can&#39;t get that data you can&#39;t get good</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.740" end="00:44:00.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s got to be a whoever whoever</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.270" end="00:44:01.690" style="s2">comes up with something new has to find</p>

<p begin="00:44:01.690" end="00:44:05.410" style="s2">have to have enough data the question is</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.370" end="00:44:07.480" style="s2">what is sufficient for the task and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.410" end="00:44:09.640" style="s2">don&#39;t throw out a hypothesis maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.480" end="00:44:11.860" style="s2">know an intense coherence is enough to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.640" end="00:44:14.200" style="s2">get a founder community that&#39;s big</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.860" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">enough which might be a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.200" end="00:44:19.060" style="s2">to a million that the network can start</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:21.160" style="s2">to tune itself from so you use coherence</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.060" end="00:44:22.900" style="s2">to jumpstart and build an environment</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.160" end="00:44:26.050" style="s2">that&#39;s perceived to be of higher quality</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.900" end="00:44:27.850" style="s2">than the kind of flatland of Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.050" end="00:44:30.580" style="s2">and then once you have a critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.850" end="00:44:32.410" style="s2">built on coherence then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.580" end="00:44:36.250" style="s2">numbers to you know start to use the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.410" end="00:44:38.170" style="s2">technology to you know and if your ideas</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.250" end="00:44:40.810" style="s2">are good enough and your coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.170" end="00:44:42.460" style="s2">pleasing enough to people you will find</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.810" end="00:44:43.900" style="s2">you will get defectors I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.460" end="00:44:46.900" style="s2">you know you I think you followed this</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.900" end="00:44:49.810" style="s2">discussion called game a and game B yep</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.900" end="00:44:52.470" style="s2">then and essentially that&#39;s the argument</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.810" end="00:44:55.120" style="s2">from the game beers that you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.470" end="00:44:57.190" style="s2">300 million people in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.120" end="00:45:00.010" style="s2">to be game B on day one you need some</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.190" end="00:45:02.680" style="s2">critical mass much much much smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.010" end="00:45:05.530" style="s2">you make it highly coherent and highly</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.680" end="00:45:08.680" style="s2">pleasing to be part of and have good</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.530" end="00:45:10.750" style="s2">tools and gradually you get defectors</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.680" end="00:45:13.630" style="s2">from gaming game B gets stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.750" end="00:45:15.640" style="s2">stronger and it&#39;s less dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.630" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">quality of the AI is in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.640" end="00:45:21.610" style="s2">because it has something else coherence</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:22.930" style="s2">and a plan and good quality of life so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.610" end="00:45:24.760" style="s2">think there are you know you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.930" end="00:45:26.740" style="s2">to attack strength to strength as we</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.760" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">know in asymmetric warfare you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.740" end="00:45:30.580" style="s2">attack strength the strength you attack</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:34.570" style="s2">somewhere else you know game B will</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.580" end="00:45:37.330" style="s2">attack through coherence and quality of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.570" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">existence rather than by brute numbers</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.330" end="00:45:44.950" style="s2">and kind of brute force AI that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:46.540" style="s2">game B hypothesis yeah I would look in</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.950" end="00:45:48.890" style="s2">terms of evaluating those those</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">alternatives I would focus on the call</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.890" end="00:45:55.790" style="s2">of the interactions if that system if</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:57.740" style="s2">that game be system is providing higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.790" end="00:46:00.530" style="s2">quality interactions than the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.740" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">alternative more so than the at the end</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.530" end="00:46:05.690" style="s2">states for the individual participants</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:07.460" style="s2">if that you know it&#39;s like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.690" end="00:46:11.630" style="s2">um did you ever read a medic in echo</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.460" end="00:46:13.940" style="s2">from Bruce Sterling no okay great short</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.630" end="00:46:15.110" style="s2">science fiction story Bruce is probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.940" end="00:46:16.370" style="s2">one of the best science fiction writers</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.110" end="00:46:18.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever come across</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.370" end="00:46:21.530" style="s2">you know his matrix is amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.500" end="00:46:24.080" style="s2">maneki-neko is a great it&#39;s online you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.530" end="00:46:26.540" style="s2">could probably find it for free and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.080" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">has a system that is a gifting system</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.540" end="00:46:29.930" style="s2">that kind of takes off in this direction</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">it comes out of nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.930" end="00:46:34.370" style="s2">you know like early tribal systems were</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:35.990" style="s2">always you know gifting and that barter</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.370" end="00:46:37.580" style="s2">was only where you cleared the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.990" end="00:46:39.860" style="s2">transaction at the end of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.580" end="00:46:42.170" style="s2">end of the engagement was only done</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.860" end="00:46:43.850" style="s2">between enemies right and that we scaled</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.170" end="00:46:45.710" style="s2">the enemy component all the way up to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.850" end="00:46:47.300" style="s2">to a global system because it we</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.710" end="00:46:49.040" style="s2">couldn&#39;t maintain the trust necessary on</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.300" end="00:46:53.450" style="s2">the tribal side to and find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.040" end="00:46:54.080" style="s2">scale it is that in that in the</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.080" end="00:46:59.330" style="s2">universe it they had a system that kept</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.120" end="00:47:00.620" style="s2">track of basically your karma and kept</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.330" end="00:47:02.030" style="s2">tracked over the needs and wants the</p>

<p begin="00:47:02.030" end="00:47:05.210" style="s2">long-term needs and once of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.500" end="00:47:07.220" style="s2">individuals that are part of the network</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.210" end="00:47:09.740" style="s2">and that they were constantly gifting</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.220" end="00:47:12.700" style="s2">you know connecting people and saying if</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.740" end="00:47:15.380" style="s2">you gift this to this person right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.700" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">you will gain you know access to more</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.380" end="00:47:18.890" style="s2">gifts future in the future and your</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:22.040" style="s2">prioritization will go up so if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.890" end="00:47:23.450" style="s2">just lost a job or had a bad day and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.040" end="00:47:25.550" style="s2">they in the system knew that they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.450" end="00:47:27.800" style="s2">have coffee and they&#39;re sitting at a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.550" end="00:47:29.480" style="s2">park bench and kind of thinking oh my</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.800" end="00:47:31.700" style="s2">god the world is terrible they would</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.480" end="00:47:33.110" style="s2">interact with somebody in the network</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.700" end="00:47:34.190" style="s2">and say bring a coffee to this person</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.110" end="00:47:37.310" style="s2">this is the type of coffee that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.190" end="00:47:39.710" style="s2">like and you do it and they go wow</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.310" end="00:47:42.200" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome or if they needed a job</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.710" end="00:47:45.170" style="s2">of a specific type or an engagement or</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.200" end="00:47:47.480" style="s2">or a specific item that&#39;s preventing</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.170" end="00:47:49.310" style="s2">them from doing or achieving some goal</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.480" end="00:47:51.110" style="s2">that the system would interconnect and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.310" end="00:47:52.610" style="s2">allow that interconnection to to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.110" end="00:47:54.740" style="s2">accelerate their their path forward</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.610" end="00:47:56.540" style="s2">eventually you know if this system gets</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.740" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">good enough at least in this short story</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.540" end="00:48:00.860" style="s2">that it would replace standard economic</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:01.740" style="s2">engagement because you&#39;ve got everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.860" end="00:48:03.930" style="s2">you really true</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.740" end="00:48:05.400" style="s2">needed through the gifting process and</p>

<p begin="00:52:24.320" end="00:52:29.630" style="s2">maybe the redress we&#39;ve been looking for</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.510" end="00:52:31.850" style="s2">right you know the problem since the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.630" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">has been increasing returns to scale</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.850" end="00:52:34.940" style="s2">network businesses have allowed</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:36.620" style="s2">businesses to get bigger and bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.940" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">bigger and bigger they&#39;ve corrupted the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.620" end="00:52:40.250" style="s2">political process and there was no</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:43.010" style="s2">constraint on them</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.250" end="00:52:45.890" style="s2">correct perhaps this form of political</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.010" end="00:52:48.560" style="s2">organizing is the redress that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.890" end="00:52:50.600" style="s2">of predatory behavior is calling for</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.560" end="00:52:52.580" style="s2">yeah I mean all of our focus right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.600" end="00:52:54.830" style="s2">is on the disorder the Trump disorder</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.580" end="00:52:57.290" style="s2">and and and associated with you plus an</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.830" end="00:52:59.840" style="s2">arrow and all those others but the real</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.290" end="00:53:02.390" style="s2">danger of the system is too much</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.840" end="00:53:05.780" style="s2">governance it&#39;s too easy to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.390" end="00:53:06.950" style="s2">you know maximal Hornets you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.780" end="00:53:08.570" style="s2">have a little bit of disorder and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.950" end="00:53:11.540" style="s2">disruption order to make sure that it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.570" end="00:53:13.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t up too heavily in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.540" end="00:53:14.840" style="s2">or so you get status and you get you get</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.490" end="00:53:16.310" style="s2">repression to get oppression and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.840" end="00:53:18.380" style="s2">just built into the system and it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.310" end="00:53:20.090" style="s2">get rid of it and your economy suffers</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.380" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">and everything suffers as a result</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.090" end="00:53:24.980" style="s2">so in granted you don&#39;t want too much</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:26.600" style="s2">disruption you end up you know this kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.980" end="00:53:28.430" style="s2">of hyper corruption like you have in</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.600" end="00:53:30.080" style="s2">Russia where Putin is like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.430" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">wealthiest guy in the world would I you</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.080" end="00:53:33.350" style="s2">know I&#39;ve seen estimates of 200 billion</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:36.920" style="s2">so it makes him twice as wealthy as</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.350" end="00:53:38.630" style="s2">Bezos he uses the network to disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.920" end="00:53:41.000" style="s2">opponents and keep the political process</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.630" end="00:53:42.860" style="s2">fluid and it allows him to do basically</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.000" end="00:53:44.900" style="s2">anything he wants at the corruption</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.860" end="00:53:46.040" style="s2">level in to consolidate power he would</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.900" end="00:53:48.710" style="s2">love to be able to do that if he could</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.040" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">get away with it oh yeah if he could but</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.710" end="00:53:52.730" style="s2">I mean the thing is I think the tendency</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:54.710" style="s2">here that the system that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.730" end="00:53:59.210" style="s2">dominant if there was a you know is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.710" end="00:54:01.850" style="s2">towards a hyper coherent system and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.210" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think we want to go that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.850" end="00:54:05.570" style="s2">direction completely we want to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:08.600" style="s2">fluid enough that we can change it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.570" end="00:54:11.690" style="s2">modify it as it moves forward also we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.600" end="00:54:14.300" style="s2">in for a world apart but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.690" end="00:54:17.360" style="s2">that you know you draw this picture of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.300" end="00:54:18.680" style="s2">left coherence doing its thing if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.360" end="00:54:20.810" style="s2">learned anything from you know our</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.680" end="00:54:23.210" style="s2">constitutional history it&#39;s always an</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.810" end="00:54:25.610" style="s2">arms race there will be a equivalent on</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.210" end="00:54:28.130" style="s2">the right very quickly right so there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.610" end="00:54:30.370" style="s2">be multiple moralities that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.130" end="00:54:32.280" style="s2">attempting to subdue</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.370" end="00:54:34.570" style="s2">in America and the bureaucracy and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.280" end="00:54:36.700" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;ll be more than two and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.570" end="00:54:39.130" style="s2">know we&#39;re locked into two in our</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.700" end="00:54:40.510" style="s2">political process by a design flaw in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.130" end="00:54:44.010" style="s2">our institutions which is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.510" end="00:54:48.220" style="s2">first-past-the-post election method and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.010" end="00:54:50.440" style="s2">our influence networks and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.220" end="00:54:51.850" style="s2">let&#39;s say moral networks are not</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.440" end="00:54:53.170" style="s2">necessarily going to be constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.850" end="00:54:55.930" style="s2">that so instead of two we might have ten</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.170" end="00:54:58.150" style="s2">of groups that are attempting to shame</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.930" end="00:55:00.310" style="s2">corporations your bureaucracies from</p>

<p begin="00:55:18.940" end="00:55:23.650" style="s2">right ends up being coming pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.710" end="00:55:25.600" style="s2">just pure disruption or not whoa I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.650" end="00:55:27.370" style="s2">see them competing meanings I see this</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.690" end="00:58:23.130" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing how how little they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.120" end="00:58:25.560" style="s2">accomplished in the world in the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.130" end="00:58:27.330" style="s2">or 30 years it&#39;s gonna get worse I read</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.560" end="00:58:28.860" style="s2">an article I think in the Economist</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.330" end="00:58:32.370" style="s2">recently and said that you know 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.860" end="00:58:35.610" style="s2">ago 25% of the 40 largest corporations</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.370" end="00:58:38.790" style="s2">on earth were European now it&#39;s - and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.610" end="00:58:40.440" style="s2">they&#39;re in positions 36 and 38 and what</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.790" end="00:58:42.030" style="s2">new thing have they created I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.440" end="00:58:45.180" style="s2">think of any what what new has come out</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.030" end="00:58:47.130" style="s2">of Europe that had any lasting staying</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.180" end="00:58:49.230" style="s2">power over the last 25 or 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.130" end="00:58:50.790" style="s2">nothing right they just have culture</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.230" end="00:58:52.470" style="s2">yeah they have culture that they sell</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.790" end="00:58:53.970" style="s2">yeah I mean basically they&#39;re a tourist</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.470" end="00:58:55.860" style="s2">location yep and in fact a science</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.970" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">fiction writer I forget which one had a</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.860" end="00:59:00.359" style="s2">near future and essentially he described</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.769" style="s2">Europe as had decided it was going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.359" end="00:59:04.170" style="s2">become the Museum of Western</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.769" end="00:59:05.609" style="s2">civilization and that was all yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.170" end="00:59:07.650" style="s2">let&#39;s switch the topic we&#39;ve hit on two</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.609" end="00:59:09.329" style="s2">or three times tangentially I like</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.650" end="00:59:11.579" style="s2">really like you to dig it on this guy no</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.329" end="00:59:13.529" style="s2">you&#39;ve thought about this a lot and this</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.579" end="00:59:14.999" style="s2">is one or I know I think we have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.529" end="00:59:17.609" style="s2">certain amount of alignment and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.999" end="00:59:19.799" style="s2">you&#39;ve called out the Chinese model as</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.609" end="00:59:23.249" style="s2">what it really is which is neo-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.799" end="00:59:26.910" style="s2">right right it&#39;s no formal leftism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.249" end="00:59:28.979" style="s2">got every aspect of neo-fascism and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.910" end="00:59:30.390" style="s2">done the same in a paper I wrote called</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.979" end="00:59:32.069" style="s2">in search of the fifth attractor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.390" end="00:59:34.589" style="s2">available on medium but where I</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.069" end="00:59:36.089" style="s2">described the neo-fascist models exemple</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.589" end="00:59:38.390" style="s2">are as China you know data-driven</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.089" end="00:59:41.009" style="s2">technologically enabled Social Credit</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.390" end="00:59:42.329" style="s2">facial recognition and more tell us</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.009" end="00:59:44.160" style="s2">about what you think the Chinese are</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.329" end="00:59:46.680" style="s2">trying to do and to what degree do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:48.299" style="s2">think it&#39;ll work okay well um you know I</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.680" end="00:59:50.339" style="s2">went back to try to get to first</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.299" end="00:59:53.219" style="s2">principles I mean water what is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.339" end="00:59:54.900" style="s2">fascist model at a organizational level</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.219" end="00:59:56.969" style="s2">as it you know how does it really work</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.900" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">and you know I went back to the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.969" end="00:59:59.549" style="s2">century and I looked at the three</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:01.380" style="s2">different models that are merged out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.549" end="01:00:02.969" style="s2">there that the communist model the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.380" end="01:00:04.829" style="s2">fascist model and the Democratic</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.969" end="01:00:07.430" style="s2">capitalism and I really had to do with</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.829" end="01:00:10.890" style="s2">how the bureaucracies were organized and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.430" end="01:00:13.440" style="s2">in communism obviously there was one big</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.890" end="01:00:16.440" style="s2">bureaucracy it ran everything economy</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.440" end="01:00:17.369" style="s2">society etc and that in democratic</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.440" end="01:00:19.349" style="s2">capitalism there was a you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.369" end="01:00:21.089" style="s2">truncated or constrained government</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.349" end="01:00:22.739" style="s2">bureaucracy and then there was lots of</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.089" end="01:00:25.049" style="s2">corporate bureaucracy so were given free</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.739" end="01:00:27.509" style="s2">rein within a you know a large playing</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.049" end="01:00:29.459" style="s2">field they stayed relatively loyal</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.509" end="01:00:32.279" style="s2">because of the dynamics of the way that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.459" end="01:00:35.579" style="s2">the world worked you know Cold War time</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.279" end="01:00:38.099" style="s2">and distance constraints and then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.579" end="01:00:39.749" style="s2">had fascism which we&#39;ve pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.099" end="01:00:43.229" style="s2">forgotten we kind of just looked at</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.749" end="01:00:45.599" style="s2">jackboots in uniform as signs of fascism</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.229" end="01:00:47.099" style="s2">but the organizational the economic</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.599" end="01:00:49.109" style="s2">organizational model is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.099" end="01:00:51.239" style="s2">interesting if you really dig into it</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.109" end="01:00:54.239" style="s2">you go okay they had a government</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.239" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">bureaucracy and lots of big corporate</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.239" end="01:00:58.949" style="s2">bureaucracies that joined with it as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:01:01.019" style="s2">cohesive whole the government provided a</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.949" end="01:01:03.299" style="s2">national goal which aligned all those</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.019" end="01:01:04.769" style="s2">big bureaucracies to focus on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.299" end="01:01:07.829" style="s2">similar goal and they focused less on</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.769" end="01:01:09.479" style="s2">competition and more on negotiation then</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.829" end="01:01:12.059" style="s2">even if you looked at the unions that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.479" end="01:01:14.430" style="s2">they consolidated all the unions into</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.059" end="01:01:16.559" style="s2">big Union and that Union had incredible</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.430" end="01:01:18.479" style="s2">pay for all the the members and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.559" end="01:01:21.329" style="s2">Industrial Workers even had three cruise</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.479" end="01:01:23.400" style="s2">ships that gave out for free for - you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.329" end="01:01:26.369" style="s2">know - all that members I mean it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.400" end="01:01:27.689" style="s2">just like exploitive it was if you want</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.369" end="01:01:29.640" style="s2">all these benefits you have to negotiate</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.689" end="01:01:32.699" style="s2">with the big companies in a line on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.640" end="01:01:35.189" style="s2">same goals now in order to get that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.699" end="01:01:37.979" style="s2">alignment at least at that time the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.189" end="01:01:40.469" style="s2">focus was on you know crude tribalism</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.979" end="01:01:42.749" style="s2">and you know the tribal appeals to</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.469" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">identity all the worst kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.749" end="01:01:48.809" style="s2">hyper militarism hyper nationalism as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:51.989" style="s2">means of setting those goals for all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.809" end="01:01:53.130" style="s2">corporate participants and when that was</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.989" end="01:01:54.989" style="s2">you know system was crushed</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.130" end="01:01:58.619" style="s2">we pretty much forgot about it but now</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.989" end="01:02:00.809" style="s2">we have a new system we Democrats in one</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.619" end="01:02:02.549" style="s2">beat the communist system in the Cold</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.809" end="01:02:04.289" style="s2">War we thought it was going to go</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.549" end="01:02:07.559" style="s2">everywhere but what we ended up doing is</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.289" end="01:02:09.150" style="s2">globalizing and we allowed the internet</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.559" end="01:02:11.729" style="s2">to connect up everyone and there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.150" end="01:02:14.959" style="s2">know the system became complex and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.729" end="01:02:19.529" style="s2">divergent and the effectiveness of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.959" end="01:02:21.029" style="s2">government bureaucracy in in democratic</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.529" end="01:02:22.589" style="s2">capitalism became less you carrying less</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.029" end="01:02:23.939" style="s2">and less effective less able to raise</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.589" end="01:02:26.519" style="s2">money less to be able to control its</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.939" end="01:02:28.079" style="s2">borders less able to influence policy</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.519" end="01:02:29.849" style="s2">over the long every you know implement a</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.079" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">policy and find it goes wrong within</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.849" end="01:02:35.549" style="s2">months and because the system is is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:37.109" style="s2">moving too quickly and the corporate</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.549" end="01:02:38.189" style="s2">participants you know broke out of their</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.109" end="01:02:39.299" style="s2">box and they were able to go</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.189" end="01:02:40.979" style="s2">international and they were started to</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.299" end="01:02:43.529" style="s2">think international and I think oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.979" end="01:02:44.849" style="s2">not really loyal to the US anymore you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.529" end="01:02:47.219" style="s2">know we&#39;re loyal to you know global</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.849" end="01:02:48.209" style="s2">audience and we&#39;ve have different ideals</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.219" end="01:02:53.249" style="s2">in different ways of looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.209" end="01:02:54.829" style="s2">world so in response to this chaos what</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.249" end="01:02:57.239" style="s2">we&#39;re saying is the development of</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.829" end="01:03:00.150" style="s2">workarounds and in China was looking at</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.239" end="01:03:01.769" style="s2">you know transforming their system they</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.150" end="01:03:05.369" style="s2">were you know still relatively</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.769" end="01:03:07.049" style="s2">totalitarian and and they opted for a</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.369" end="01:03:08.819" style="s2">system that looks very organized and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.049" end="01:03:11.369" style="s2">almost exactly the same way as the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.819" end="01:03:12.989" style="s2">fascist model you can see I work now in</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.369" end="01:03:14.609" style="s2">the in the conflict who is Hong Kong is</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.989" end="01:03:17.929" style="s2">that they were looking for corporations</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.609" end="01:03:20.249" style="s2">to sign on in compliance with you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.929" end="01:03:22.019" style="s2">enforcing their stance against the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.249" end="01:03:23.579" style="s2">protesters so if they have a protesters</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.019" end="01:03:25.049" style="s2">working for them and they recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.579" end="01:03:25.710" style="s2">person as such they are supposed to fire</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.049" end="01:03:28.859" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.710" end="01:03:31.290" style="s2">and turn off support for people who</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.859" end="01:03:33.030" style="s2">support the protest etc or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.290" end="01:03:34.859" style="s2">aligning with their they&#39;re aligning</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.030" end="01:03:36.780" style="s2">their companies to focus on creating a</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.859" end="01:03:38.940" style="s2">social credit network that works in kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.780" end="01:03:41.609" style="s2">of a Confucian model that is very</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.940" end="01:03:43.560" style="s2">patriotic that doesn&#39;t allow anyone to</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.609" end="01:03:43.980" style="s2">discuss specific topics or criticize the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.560" end="01:03:46.740" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.980" end="01:03:49.740" style="s2">so you know their system is this new</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.740" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">type of fascism so you know you need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.740" end="01:03:52.560" style="s2">see you can actually see the battle</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:54.390" style="s2">going you know working on the on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.560" end="01:03:57.420" style="s2">street level the battle over in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.390" end="01:03:59.310" style="s2">corporate alignment in Hong Kong is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.420" end="01:04:01.770" style="s2">you know the government has companies</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.310" end="01:04:02.970" style="s2">that they&#39;ve forced into alignment you</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.770" end="01:04:06.180" style="s2">know you&#39;re kind of using the fascist</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.970" end="01:04:08.700" style="s2">system and the protesters as an</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.180" end="01:04:11.089" style="s2">open-source network are trying to punish</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.700" end="01:04:13.710" style="s2">those companies so they&#39;ll selectively</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.089" end="01:04:15.300" style="s2">deface the buildings or the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.710" end="01:04:18.060" style="s2">storefronts of companies that have opted</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.300" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">to support China so you&#39;ll see it just</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.060" end="01:04:22.140" style="s2">you know dot dot dot dot dot down the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:24.060" style="s2">street as the protest moves forward with</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.140" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">the companies that are fighting them</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.060" end="01:04:28.530" style="s2">being punished for that activity so you</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:32.250" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty interesting to see</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.530" end="01:04:34.770" style="s2">the the emergence of fascism you can see</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.250" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">the battle in the states is in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.770" end="01:04:39.780" style="s2">very similar to that you know who gets</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:42.240" style="s2">to control the companies Kenny force</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.780" end="01:04:44.460" style="s2">them into alignment to reduce the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.240" end="01:04:46.170" style="s2">instability caused by globalization etc</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.460" end="01:04:47.970" style="s2">see that in Russia Russia has already</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.170" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">done it through cross holdings and mafia</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.970" end="01:04:54.990" style="s2">style tactics anyway fascism is back</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:56.040" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the true winner of the big</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.990" end="01:04:59.359" style="s2">conflict between the three different</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.040" end="01:05:02.250" style="s2">systems but it&#39;s different and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.359" end="01:05:04.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look and feel exactly like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.250" end="01:05:07.080" style="s2">previous version of it history doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.170" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">repeat but it rhymes right yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.080" end="01:05:11.070" style="s2">would point back to you know those is</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:14.690" style="s2">again the driver is the libido for</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.070" end="01:05:17.369" style="s2">coherence you know the resistance is</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.690" end="01:05:19.890" style="s2">trying to produce some coherence at the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.369" end="01:05:22.800" style="s2">intersection of humanity and corporate</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.890" end="01:05:24.839" style="s2">America right and again with the danger</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.800" end="01:05:28.320" style="s2">of overshooting and become stifling and</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.839" end="01:05:30.180" style="s2">just full of you know wrong ideas in</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.320" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">their particular case with some good</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.180" end="01:05:35.190" style="s2">some good ideas some bad ideas the</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:37.170" style="s2">Chinese are also probably at least</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.190" end="01:05:39.300" style="s2">partially operating in good faith trying</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.170" end="01:05:41.040" style="s2">to produce a better society by</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.300" end="01:05:44.490" style="s2">making sure their corporations don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.040" end="01:05:45.870" style="s2">hyper capitalist like the West did right</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.490" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">and so again they&#39;re attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.870" end="01:05:49.980" style="s2">create more coherence that&#39;s minutes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:52.500" style="s2">starting to see this as the seer stone</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.980" end="01:05:54.870" style="s2">if you start thinking about in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.500" end="01:05:57.060" style="s2">greater versus lesser coherence I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.870" end="01:05:59.190" style="s2">you start to see what the drivers of all</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.060" end="01:06:01.350" style="s2">these various systems are including the</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.190" end="01:06:03.120" style="s2">Chinese at least until it enters its</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.350" end="01:06:05.070" style="s2">corrupt phase which of course it always</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.120" end="01:06:07.140" style="s2">has been more corrupt in the u.s. though</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.070" end="01:06:10.170" style="s2">not as corrupt as China could either go</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.140" end="01:06:13.110" style="s2">to develop good institutions to</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.170" end="01:06:15.030" style="s2">administer sort of a positive fascism or</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.110" end="01:06:17.520" style="s2">probably more likely it&#39;ll be captured</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.030" end="01:06:19.320" style="s2">and become hyper corrupt like Russia I</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.520" end="01:06:21.240" style="s2">just become an extraction mechanism for</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.320" end="01:06:25.260" style="s2">those who have the levers of power right</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.240" end="01:06:26.910" style="s2">yep and coherence is a you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.260" end="01:06:29.760" style="s2">foundational state you need in order to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.910" end="01:06:32.190" style="s2">make decisions effective decisions so</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.760" end="01:06:34.440" style="s2">you know without it nothing is possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.190" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">yeah what do you think about the chance</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.440" end="01:06:38.130" style="s2">of the Chinese model spreading elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:39.690" style="s2">I mean to degree the Chinese want to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.130" end="01:06:41.400" style="s2">their thing in China I don&#39;t really give</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.690" end="01:06:43.350" style="s2">a shit tell you the truth to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.400" end="01:06:44.730" style="s2">they want to put their network model out</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.350" end="01:06:47.100" style="s2">into the world and compete the way the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.730" end="01:06:48.690" style="s2">Marxist Leninist is did then that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.100" end="01:06:52.320" style="s2">completely different kettle of fish</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.690" end="01:06:53.970" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s conceptually it works you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.320" end="01:06:56.070" style="s2">you get the Social Credit system that</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.970" end="01:06:58.490" style="s2">works you get their reaction systems</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.070" end="01:07:00.630" style="s2">they&#39;re putting the we guards through</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.490" end="01:07:02.280" style="s2">potentially it would work as you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.630" end="01:07:04.590" style="s2">wiping out Islam as a religion and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.280" end="01:07:06.060" style="s2">replacing it with Chinese culture but</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.590" end="01:07:07.650" style="s2">the problem is it&#39;s too tied to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.060" end="01:07:10.560" style="s2">culture I don&#39;t know how exportable that</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.650" end="01:07:12.090" style="s2">is I mean Greta there are countries that</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.560" end="01:07:14.460" style="s2">will embrace it me it could have</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.090" end="01:07:16.170" style="s2">Singapore embrace it for instance you</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.460" end="01:07:19.050" style="s2">know extension kind of kind of culture</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.170" end="01:07:22.070" style="s2">as a service stability or coherence as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.050" end="01:07:24.660" style="s2">service will take care of your you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.070" end="01:07:26.360" style="s2">their ray occation camps as a service</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.660" end="01:07:29.310" style="s2">like I will take care of your your</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.360" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">recalcitrant minorities and realign them</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.310" end="01:07:34.620" style="s2">and then will provide a system for</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.920" end="01:07:36.120" style="s2">connecting up your citizens but see the</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.620" end="01:07:38.550" style="s2">thing is I think it&#39;s too tied to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.120" end="01:07:40.350" style="s2">the Confucian system you get it and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.550" end="01:07:41.640" style="s2">Chinese culture in in general yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.350" end="01:07:43.440" style="s2">agree with you that&#39;s why I&#39;m less</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.640" end="01:07:44.820" style="s2">concerned about it perhaps than sums up</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.440" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">the Chinese want to build their country</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.820" end="01:07:50.010" style="s2">that way let them have at it right right</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:51.840" style="s2">it does not seem likely to be the kind</p>

<p begin="01:09:10.230" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">like Facebook is right now and they know</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.699" end="01:09:36.540" style="s2">not getting that China doesn&#39;t have it I</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.319" end="01:09:39.060" style="s2">think you&#39;re right I&#39;m and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.540" end="01:09:40.859" style="s2">probably both of us are less concerned</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.060" end="01:09:43.259" style="s2">about China maybe then some people are</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.859" end="01:09:45.000" style="s2">you know China may do its thing and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.259" end="01:09:47.009" style="s2">may be weird and we may not like it but</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.000" end="01:09:49.290" style="s2">as long as it&#39;s not spreading around the</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.009" end="01:09:51.029" style="s2">world why should we care yeah correct I</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.290" end="01:09:52.500" style="s2">mean they are spreading to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.029" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">extent they&#39;re exerting influence you</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.500" end="01:09:56.520" style="s2">saw that you know the South Park thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:58.920" style="s2">and you saw they the NBA folding like</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.520" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">you know a deck of cards it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.920" end="01:10:05.870" style="s2">just that kind of influence spread is is</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:07.940" style="s2">not something we we should put up with</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.870" end="01:10:10.489" style="s2">ya that&#39;s an economic and that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.940" end="01:10:12.290" style="s2">where our goddamn corporations worship</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.489" end="01:10:14.300" style="s2">the almighty dollar over any higher</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.290" end="01:10:16.699" style="s2">values right well they&#39;re forcing them</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.300" end="01:10:20.180" style="s2">into alignment is the fastest model so</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.699" end="01:10:21.680" style="s2">you know we need we need a you know the</p>

<p begin="01:10:21.680" end="01:10:25.340" style="s2">actually set the value system for those</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.360" end="01:10:27.140" style="s2">corporations they would be potentially</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.340" end="01:10:29.390" style="s2">resistant to that and the companies</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.140" end="01:10:32.120" style="s2">would say mtech Ike exactly that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.390" end="01:10:33.410" style="s2">alternative and we do have examples give</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.120" end="01:10:36.020" style="s2">them credit both Google and Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.410" end="01:10:38.690" style="s2">have not been willing to play the game</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.020" end="01:10:40.340" style="s2">with the Chinese at least so far clearly</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.690" end="01:10:41.810" style="s2">Google would kind of like to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.340" end="01:10:44.600" style="s2">how to do it but they haven&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.810" end="01:10:46.580" style="s2">the real offender to my mind you know is</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.600" end="01:10:49.100" style="s2">Cisco people don&#39;t realize this but</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.580" end="01:10:51.710" style="s2">Cisco is the ones that help the Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.100" end="01:10:53.210" style="s2">design their Great Firewall they they</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.710" end="01:10:55.640" style="s2">have essentially were the enabling</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.210" end="01:10:58.160" style="s2">catalyst for all China has done in terms</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.640" end="01:10:59.900" style="s2">of managing their information flows and</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.160" end="01:11:01.190" style="s2">so they&#39;ve been a very bad citizen and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.900" end="01:11:04.310" style="s2">would like to see something like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.190" end="01:11:05.600" style="s2">resistance put a thumb on corporations</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.310" end="01:11:09.050" style="s2">and say you know you really shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.600" end="01:11:11.120" style="s2">empowering totalitarian dictators yep</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.050" end="01:11:12.949" style="s2">and the others NBA examples a fine</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:15.710" style="s2">example unfortunately hyper capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.949" end="01:11:17.510" style="s2">you know you know the NBA sees their</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.710" end="01:11:19.489" style="s2">next big market and so they don&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.510" end="01:11:20.690" style="s2">two shits about Chinese culture or</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.489" end="01:11:23.390" style="s2">coherence but they just see the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.690" end="01:11:26.090" style="s2">possibility of losing out to you know a</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.390" end="01:11:28.040" style="s2">large dollar denominated market so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.090" end="01:11:30.620" style="s2">know our weakness hyper capitalism gets</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.040" end="01:11:33.199" style="s2">exploited by the more coherent system</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.620" end="01:11:35.630" style="s2">over in China if we had a more coherent</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.199" end="01:11:37.880" style="s2">system our companies would be less</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.630" end="01:11:40.850" style="s2">manipulatable correct then they would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.880" end="01:11:42.590" style="s2">more downsides to actually folding like</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.850" end="01:11:45.140" style="s2">that exactly and so you would actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.590" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">lose more by trying to you know focus on</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.140" end="01:11:49.730" style="s2">the on the come of a new market that may</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:51.080" style="s2">may or may not pan out all right got a</p>

<p begin="01:12:01.940" end="01:12:05.750" style="s2">implications well there&#39;s been a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.070" end="01:12:07.219" style="s2">a drumbeat in the background you know</p>

<p begin="01:17:01.800" end="01:17:05.790" style="s2">from that exercise that you can talk to</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.630" end="01:17:07.860" style="s2">us about well I mean it was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.790" end="01:17:09.690" style="s2">strange for for the chairman of Joint</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.860" end="01:17:11.910" style="s2">Chiefs as they do something called</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.690" end="01:17:13.770" style="s2">concepts usually they&#39;re on pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.910" end="01:17:16.320" style="s2">mundane topics for how the joint force</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.770" end="01:17:18.300" style="s2">would fight today if called upon to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.320" end="01:17:20.220" style="s2">so this was unusual and that they were</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.300" end="01:17:23.070" style="s2">looking 20 years out on autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.220" end="01:17:25.380" style="s2">robotics how that would transform the</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.070" end="01:17:27.630" style="s2">joint force you know for the chairman to</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.380" end="01:17:30.240" style="s2">kind of push this forward and they</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.630" end="01:17:32.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t have you know Stephan hand that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.240" end="01:17:35.610" style="s2">was really good at this kind of advanced</p>

<p begin="01:17:35.610" end="01:17:41.250" style="s2">of thinking out of the box kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.160" end="01:17:43.920" style="s2">so I got brought in on that and you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.250" end="01:17:45.540" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a funny process</p>

<p begin="01:17:47.100" end="01:17:50.280" style="s2">know new ideas and they in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.570" end="01:17:53.400" style="s2">government it&#39;s just you know most of</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.280" end="01:17:55.110" style="s2">the most the ideas I have to go through</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.400" end="01:17:57.270" style="s2">so many hands and somebody sign off said</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.110" end="01:17:58.830" style="s2">everything gets watered down but some</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.270" end="01:18:00.930" style="s2">cool stuff came out of at least a you</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.830" end="01:18:02.910" style="s2">know in terms of where it has to go in</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.930" end="01:18:04.740" style="s2">order to be effective you know things</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.910" end="01:18:06.390" style="s2">like you know moving from if you have an</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.740" end="01:18:09.630" style="s2">autonomous weapon how do you verify that</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.390" end="01:18:12.390" style="s2">is effective really you know autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.630" end="01:18:14.160" style="s2">weapon typically in the past we look at</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.390" end="01:18:16.110" style="s2">the you know the error rates generated</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.110" end="01:18:19.860" style="s2">a whole and you can measure that and</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.990" end="01:18:22.290" style="s2">determine whether or not it would work</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.860" end="01:18:24.120" style="s2">with an autonomous weapon system the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.290" end="01:18:27.030" style="s2">range of behaviors is is much greater</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.120" end="01:18:28.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s a black box if it incorporates</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.030" end="01:18:29.910" style="s2">like deep learning and you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.590" end="01:18:31.500" style="s2">know you can&#39;t do the reverse</p>

<p begin="01:18:55.320" end="01:18:59.970" style="s2">them into that task in and judge to</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.260" end="01:19:01.290" style="s2">behave or certify their behavior and do</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.970" end="01:19:03.270" style="s2">it again and again and again and again</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.290" end="01:19:05.520" style="s2">until you&#39;re satisfied that they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.270" end="01:19:07.170" style="s2">it effectively and there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.520" end="01:19:08.190" style="s2">chance that they&#39;ll do it wrong but you</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.170" end="01:19:09.960" style="s2">know you have to go with that</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.190" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">certification and the same thing is true</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.960" end="01:19:13.440" style="s2">with a with an autonomous system you can</p>

<p begin="01:19:21.800" end="01:19:28.140" style="s2">structure the potential here also is and</p>

<p begin="01:20:01.410" end="01:20:04.050" style="s2">you come up with this one new technique</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.910" end="01:20:06.120" style="s2">and then you could take that technique</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.050" end="01:20:09.060" style="s2">and then share it throughout the joint</p>

<p begin="01:20:55.440" end="01:20:59.820" style="s2">hardware and proven it takes 20-30 years</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.300" end="01:21:01.729" style="s2">to roll out a new weapon system becomes</p>

<p begin="01:21:08.309" end="01:21:12.300" style="s2">you&#39;re using it and that changes though</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.949" end="01:21:13.800" style="s2">you know kind of perspective on this if</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.300" end="01:21:16.229" style="s2">the system&#39;s dumb and it can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.800" end="01:21:17.819" style="s2">better through experience then you know</p>

<p begin="01:21:20.249" end="01:21:25.019" style="s2">get better from that interaction but</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.679" end="01:21:27.389" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the system kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.019" end="01:21:29.219" style="s2">system you&#39;re shooting for and then the</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.389" end="01:21:31.429" style="s2">difference in tactics and strategies you</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.219" end="01:21:33.989" style="s2">know an autonomous weapon</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.429" end="01:21:36.689" style="s2">you know opens up or truly autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.989" end="01:21:37.949" style="s2">weapon is is like right now we can fire</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.689" end="01:21:39.510" style="s2">a weapon and you know like a cruise</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.949" end="01:21:42.539" style="s2">missile and you know six hours later it</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.510" end="01:21:44.729" style="s2">ends up on target or drone you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.539" end="01:21:46.589" style="s2">it navigates the target he may be make</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.729" end="01:21:49.499" style="s2">some Corrections based on the opposition</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.589" end="01:21:50.639" style="s2">if it interacts with but it hits a</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.499" end="01:21:52.619" style="s2">target and we&#39;re pretty comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.639" end="01:21:53.789" style="s2">that they&#39;re pretty de stabilising</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.619" end="01:21:55.800" style="s2">granted but they&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.789" end="01:21:58.260" style="s2">with how that works well what about a</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.800" end="01:22:00.359" style="s2">system autonomous system that you let go</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.260" end="01:22:02.929" style="s2">and two years later it launches it</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.359" end="01:22:05.569" style="s2">attack like it&#39;s something that actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.929" end="01:22:08.069" style="s2">drifts very slowly across the Pacific</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.569" end="01:22:09.479" style="s2">finds that Chinese Harbor digs itself</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.069" end="01:22:11.819" style="s2">into the muck of the Chinese Harbor and</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.479" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">just waits until and gathers information</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.819" end="01:22:16.079" style="s2">passively figures out the best targets</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:18.449" style="s2">to hit at any given moment and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.079" end="01:22:19.979" style="s2">looks for just a signal that either</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.449" end="01:22:22.919" style="s2">should attack or the conditions change</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.979" end="01:22:24.839" style="s2">such that it it&#39;s ready to attack and</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.919" end="01:22:26.939" style="s2">then you you could start to pre position</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.839" end="01:22:28.589" style="s2">these things and then you could like</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.939" end="01:22:30.089" style="s2">talk about truly to stabilizing</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.589" end="01:22:33.569" style="s2">something that can really really change</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.089" end="01:22:35.309" style="s2">the the way work war works is that is</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.569" end="01:22:37.379" style="s2">that you can roll these things out and</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.309" end="01:22:40.800" style="s2">they can slowly you know pre position in</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.379" end="01:22:43.199" style="s2">a myriad of locations or you know around</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.800" end="01:22:45.689" style="s2">an a potential future enemy like dig</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.199" end="01:22:48.929" style="s2">themselves in to landscape and just wait</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.689" end="01:22:51.149" style="s2">and then when they conflict hits that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.929" end="01:22:54.209" style="s2">a true zero day right zero day conflict</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.149" end="01:22:56.369" style="s2">it just they pop up wars over they break</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.209" end="01:22:59.489" style="s2">all the networks they destroy all the</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.369" end="01:23:02.699" style="s2">enemy capabilities they take it out keep</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.489" end="01:23:05.129" style="s2">it down you just walk in and also think</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.699" end="01:23:06.809" style="s2">of a ramp-up possibility you know with</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.129" end="01:23:08.579" style="s2">humans I don&#39;t know what it costs the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.809" end="01:23:09.749" style="s2">army to train up a soldier these days</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.579" end="01:23:11.609" style="s2">but certainly in the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.749" end="01:23:13.530" style="s2">thousands of dollars I would imagine and</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.609" end="01:23:15.230" style="s2">it we know it takes a year or two before</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.530" end="01:23:17.630" style="s2">a soldier is very effective</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.230" end="01:23:18.830" style="s2">right you know a robotic soldier you</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.630" end="01:23:20.540" style="s2">know might get the price down at ten</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.830" end="01:23:22.550" style="s2">thousand or twenty five thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.540" end="01:23:24.980" style="s2">and could build them as fast as you</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.550" end="01:23:26.870" style="s2">could build factories so the thing could</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.980" end="01:23:29.390" style="s2">you know we could go be back to the ear</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.870" end="01:23:31.160" style="s2">of World War two mass warfare with very</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.390" end="01:23:33.020" style="s2">few humans involved but you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.160" end="01:23:33.739" style="s2">literally millions of robots fighting</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.020" end="01:23:38.690" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.739" end="01:23:41.239" style="s2">oh yeah the it also makes possible you</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.690" end="01:23:43.400" style="s2">know war between nuclear powers where it</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.239" end="01:23:46.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t possible before so like for</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.400" end="01:23:49.700" style="s2">instance say we have a conflict with</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.760" end="01:23:52.010" style="s2">China over the Spratly Islands so</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.700" end="01:23:54.920" style="s2">instead of sending in troops that or</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.010" end="01:23:56.300" style="s2">sending in you know aircraft carriers so</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.920" end="01:23:58.460" style="s2">they&#39;ll become big fat targets that if</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.300" end="01:23:59.810" style="s2">they do get destroyed you know five</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.460" end="01:24:01.430" style="s2">thousand people die or ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.810" end="01:24:03.500" style="s2">people die which then is a pretext for</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.430" end="01:24:07.340" style="s2">nuclear war I&#39;m too destabilizing too</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.500" end="01:24:09.800" style="s2">too dangerous is that we stumble into a</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.340" end="01:24:11.750" style="s2">pattern where we demarcate an area like</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.800" end="01:24:13.250" style="s2">a hundred miles around the Spratlys and</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.750" end="01:24:15.910" style="s2">all those coral reefs and everything</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.250" end="01:24:18.430" style="s2">else and it becomes a war between</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.910" end="01:24:21.440" style="s2">robotic systems or no human life is lost</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.430" end="01:24:23.390" style="s2">but it&#39;s really kind of a plant the flag</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.440" end="01:24:26.300" style="s2">thing you know this is a cylinder around</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.390" end="01:24:27.680" style="s2">that area and that all of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.300" end="01:24:30.170" style="s2">capabilities that you could throw into</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.680" end="01:24:32.000" style="s2">that space determine the victor</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.170" end="01:24:34.370" style="s2">determine the one that can actually it</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.000" end="01:24:36.560" style="s2">is is superpower conflict but it cannot</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.370" end="01:24:37.900" style="s2">strained yes anything that&#39;s like World</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.560" end="01:24:41.000" style="s2">War two which eventually became</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.900" end="01:24:42.350" style="s2">industrial outcome yeah let&#39;s say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.000" end="01:24:45.580" style="s2">interesting I still think about this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.350" end="01:24:48.590" style="s2">a game right you define this 100 mile</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.580" end="01:24:51.590" style="s2">diameter cylinder maybe a bigger net and</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.590" end="01:24:53.989" style="s2">the both sides agree quote-unquote that</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.590" end="01:24:56.450" style="s2">we can have at it with non weapons of</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.989" end="01:24:57.860" style="s2">mass destruction robots only let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.450" end="01:24:59.660" style="s2">who wins right that could go on for a</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.860" end="01:25:01.880" style="s2">long time right both sides cranking up</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.660" end="01:25:04.700" style="s2">more and more and more and more robots</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.880" end="01:25:07.190" style="s2">and drones and bottom crawling ocean</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.700" end="01:25:09.800" style="s2">vehicles it will pop up on unexpectedly</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.190" end="01:25:11.330" style="s2">at various places it&#39;d be pretty nuts I</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.800" end="01:25:13.760" style="s2">would waste a huge amount of resources</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.330" end="01:25:16.160" style="s2">of humanity right and then of course the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.760" end="01:25:17.120" style="s2">question is can does it really D not</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.160" end="01:25:18.380" style="s2">escalate</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.120" end="01:25:20.900" style="s2">you know if the Chinese find themselves</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.380" end="01:25:24.200" style="s2">losing are they tempted to escalate to</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.900" end="01:25:26.660" style="s2">nuclear weapons say to use EMP forces</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.200" end="01:25:28.370" style="s2">just to wipe out all the robots don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.660" end="01:25:28.760" style="s2">know then you have EMP resistant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.370" end="01:25:30.230" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.760" end="01:25:31.489" style="s2">and it&#39;s a good club whose area was</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.230" end="01:25:34.130" style="s2">there a published report that people</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.489" end="01:25:35.510" style="s2">could get their hands on no there was</p>
