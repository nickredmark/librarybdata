<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:09.040" style="s2">directly to do with artificial</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">intelligence or cognitive science but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:11.920" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">is entertaining he&#39;s certainly in my top</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">of tweet streams that i enjoy following</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:18.799" style="s2">so let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:20.720" style="s2">with understanding sort of your</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.799" end="00:01:22.479" style="s2">motivation how did you get into this</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">and here&#39;s a quote from i think from one</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.479" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">of your talks maybe it&#39;s from a paper i</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">you said we need to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">nature of a.i</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">to understand who we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">yeah i think that artificial</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2">intelligence is an idea is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">in some sense the missing link between</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">philosophy and mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the attempt to make the execution</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">of processes that allow us to use</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">and make it refer to meaning automatic</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">and understandable and scalable</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:55.600" style="s2">and this basically allows us to ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:58.719" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.600" end="00:02:00.640" style="s2">use of languages that have meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">machinery that we understand in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.640" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">mechanical universe</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:05.680" style="s2">this idea that the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">mechanical might sound limiting to many</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">people but it&#39;s not a very limiting idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:09.759" style="s2">it simply means</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">that the universe is not magic that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">not built over</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">um symbolic correlations or symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">but over uh things that have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">conspiracy inside of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">and the other thing is that if you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">as a system that has no conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">inside of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">what kind of system is it and ai is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">attempt to build a testable theory of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">what that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">and if we are able to test that theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">successfully we will have built a system</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">that in the ways in which it matters is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">going to be like us</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">which means it&#39;s going to be a system</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">that is able to reflect on its</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">environment and its own role in it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">and make a model of that understand that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">and understand its own nature as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">right so this project of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">artificial intelligence in my view is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">a capstone of the certain philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">tradition or maybe of all philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">traditions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">the question of what are we in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">universe and what&#39;s our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">the universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">that contains us what is the observer</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">all the other questions come from that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s in my view the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">important question there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">yeah i have to agree that as i&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">artificial intelligence particularly</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">artificial general intelligence over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">about six years i&#39;ve started digging to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">it in some depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve found myself being forced to ask</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">just those kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">which kind of surprised me right and of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">course we both know that not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">interested in ai</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">is interested in it at this kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">level there&#39;s an awful lot of narrow ai</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">these days which we&#39;ll talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">you know cognitive ai and narrow ai and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">artificial general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">and and more applied things so i take it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">that you would consider yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:57.439" style="s2">not just an ai guy but also interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">in artificial</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.439" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">general intelligence i think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">artificial intelligence is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">reboot the original idea of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">intelligence so it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:10.159" style="s2">agi and the original ai are the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.159" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">when ai started out as a field it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">done by a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">across disciplines there were some</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">cyberneticians there were running</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">computer scientists computer science was</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">just getting started</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">uh some information theorists and even</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">involved in the whole thing and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">we now understand how computers work we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">everything that we understand we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">express</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">as constructive mathematical paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">constructive mathematics is the part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">math that works and it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">the same as computation so let&#39;s go and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">teach the computers how to think and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">the first generation of people that set</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">out to do this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">were very optimistic they basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">thought this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">an extended summer project maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">couple years then we will have make</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">made tremendous progress and as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">turned out</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">they did make tremendous progress with</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">hindsight so they did</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">a lot of amazing feeds like it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">take that long to teach computers how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">decent chess which means chess that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">much better than make</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">abilities even before computers became</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">superhuman chess</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">and how to get this thing to do very</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">simple planning and so on this didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">take long</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">a set of programming languages that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">used today almost all of them have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">invented in their structure and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">principles in the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">couple decades after ai has started and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">the effort was</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">very much connected throughout computer</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">science so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">almost everything that didn&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">computer science was ai</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">and when it worked then it became</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">something boring</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">and ai has in some sense has been always</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">the pioneer battalion of computer</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">science and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.800" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">very very productive as a field but most</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">of the people that work on it realize</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">this optimism of building a machine that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">thinks in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">a short time that is for instance within</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">the time of a couple grand proposals or</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.759" style="s2">your entire career that&#39;s very daunting</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not going to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.759" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">so they&#39;re focused on things that uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">were going to give results within the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">duration of a grant proposal or within</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">the duration of a career</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">and these also the things that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">going to give you tenure so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">aia became more and more applied more</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:22.319" style="s2">narrow and it was about</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.840" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">improving the automation of statistics</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">and uh developing mathematics around</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">that and theory around that and so on</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">and it uh this philosophical project</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">has only captured the attention of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">relatively few people in the field</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">as philosophical projects happen to do i</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">think in some sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">correct and it&#39;s the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">because philosophical projects are</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">daunting hard risky and often have only</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">marginal benefits so</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.919" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">why not go for this thing that gives</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">very tangible benefits</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">right here right now and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">the majority of the field did</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">there are also some political upheavals</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">within the field that happened right</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">when minsky</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:07:00.319" style="s2">claimed that cognitive ai was in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">sense the same thing as symbolic ai i</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.319" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">think he made the wrong bet</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">and minsky was somebody who was an</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">extreme visionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">but he was also somebody who wasn&#39;t not</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">so interested in the visions of other</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">and so he&#39;s basically screamed at people</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">that did cybernetics and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">did neural networks and actively delayed</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">development of the dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">models of cognition and of machine</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">learning systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">for more than a decade basically who</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">moved the funding for</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">neural networks and apparently also</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">impaired the funding of cybernetics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">contributed to the ending of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">cybernetics as a field in the us to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">i say suspect funding and airtime for</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">his own approaches</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">and in some sense it&#39;s not his fault</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">that he could not see that he was not</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">that his approaches ultimately would</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">lead to difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.319" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">in grounding concepts and building an</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">understanding that goes beyond symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">but he inadvertently created a division</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">cognitive ai that was his own followers</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">and disciples and everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">and so the other people did not read prg</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">anymore and they did not think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">psychology very much anymore</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">and this division within artificial</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:12.479" style="s2">intelligence between</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">people that think about cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.479" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">psychology and people that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">think about how to for instance process</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">images and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">how to interact with an environment uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">this division</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">lasts until today in many ways even</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">the gap is closing more and more yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">and and yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">if you talk to people even at google</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">they will admit</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">late in the afternoon or after several</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">beers that the reason they got into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">field was something like agi</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">absolutely when i entered university i i</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">only did this because i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">understand how the mind works and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">why i studied computer science and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">and a few other things and it was very</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">disappointing to me to see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">philosophers were completely not</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">into this mostly didn&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">ideas that computer science</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">has said developed during the last 50</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">years at all</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">and if so then only in a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">superficial and derisive way</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">and the computer scientists were not</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">interested in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">and it was really depressing to me and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">uh i was not alone in this so</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">when i was a grad student or not even</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">grad students who basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">post the equivalent of a bachelor other</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">students would ask me when they entered</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">the field and there was a tutor</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">where can i do ai here who&#39;s offering</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">real ai classes</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">even though we had a very large and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">active ai department or university</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">and so i decided that i had to offer ai</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">classes right so as a student i started</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">uh doing a seminar on building cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">architectures</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">and on thinking about the mind and so i</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">got a dozen students who started</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">building things with me and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">of the microsci architecture by the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">this is how i got</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">into working in academia as a student</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">ah that&#39;s a very interesting story you</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">sort of reacted against</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">the prevailing trends in academia where</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">as you said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">unfortunately the funding and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">promotional carrots you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:08.560" style="s2">rewards are focused on you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.560" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">incremental steps against you know known</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">benchmarks you know you raise the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">benchmark by</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">half a percent and you have a paper you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">can publish when you publish seven</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">papers you get tenure right</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s not the grand question of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">do we make a machine</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">that thinks sort of like a human are you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">still optimistic that we can create</p>

<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">needs to be answered is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:59.519" style="s2">a lot of technical details and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">for a lot of these details i think doors</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.519" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">have opened</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">to work on them in the last few years so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">uh even though i don&#39;t know how long</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">it&#39;s going to take</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">lifetime i think there&#39;s a significant</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">that we will see something that is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">human-like but in many areas</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">superhuman-like and then other areas</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">good enough like uh within our lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">or maybe even in the next few years</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s hard to say you know it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">of these damn questions it could be five</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">years it could be a hundred years or</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">more right and of course it also as you</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">depends on where you&#39;re measuring if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">talk about every single facility it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">might be 100 years but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about superhuman</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">capability in certain domains that could</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">or frankly already has happened in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">narrow domains like image recognition</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">under certain very constrained cases and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">those windows will</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">open larger and larger and i will also</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">say that one of the things that&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">me more optimistic about superhuman</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">capacity across the board is the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">i&#39;ve learned about cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">frankly how limited the human brain is</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">things like working memory size</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">fidelity of memory you know etc</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:11.519" style="s2">we&#39;re not that smart compared to what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">could be working memory alone</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.519" end="00:12:15.760" style="s2">is a huge bottleneck on for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">practical level of recursion</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">in language and chunking size of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">concepts etc</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:24.560" style="s2">you know the low fidelity of our memory</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">and lack of persistence is certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.560" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">major cognitive limitation</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">so i&#39;m not one of those people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.399" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">thinks that the humans are the top</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">of the intelligence spectrum frankly i</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">believe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">approximately the stupidest possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">general intelligence which is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">surprising you know evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">seldom profligate with its gifts and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">over line of general intelligence at</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">least so it appears</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">we&#39;re probably just over the line and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.320" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">one of those who is also very hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">that we can get not just</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2">over the line but way over the line at</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">least in some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">you know such as language understanding</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:04.839" style="s2">the ability to read the literature of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">discipline and actually make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.839" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">etc i remember that i&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">very disappointed in the capacity of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">brain as a child and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">later on and i also felt bad about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">because at the same time i was</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">confronted with</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">the superstitious belief of most people</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">that if you apply yourself there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">basically no limit to what the brain can</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">do right</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">we could have maybe infinite memory</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">maybe if we would just pay attention all</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">we could read all the books and retain</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">all the books we could retain all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">movie maybe we could have photographic</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">memory for everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">maybe there is no limit to our</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">intelligence if we really apply</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">ourselves and meditate enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">right and later occurred to me that this</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">is probably not the case</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">i do know uh many people that are much</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">much smarter than myself and know much</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">more than myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">but it&#39;s often at the expense of other</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">things so they it</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">means that they tend to have a much</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">narrower view on</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">on things and know these things much</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">much more deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">apply their attention to exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">these things and not to others</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">of course there are some people which</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">are way smarter than me across the board</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">i am totally in awe of them but still</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just a shorter human brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">and this shorter human brain i still</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">how much compute we need and how much</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">ingenuity we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">to replicate the schrodiness of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">right so even though we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">limits of what it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">to get this to run it might be possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">that it&#39;s doable or something that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">as an average person already buy and put</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">your basement if you really want to so</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">something in the order of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">say 20k of compute maybe that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">optimistic enough to say that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">chance that this is the case</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">yeah attention i&#39;ve had numerous</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">discussions with our mutual friend ben</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">gertzell about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">right and you know i think we both have</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">come to the view that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">i think it will turn out to be what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">the appropriate level of representation</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">my home academic discipline is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">evolutionary computing</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">and in evolutionary computing again and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.519" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">again and again it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">what is the representation on whether a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">technique will provide traction on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">problem and so if it turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">actual right level of representation</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">is indeed the neuron then probably 20k</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:24.800" style="s2">computers won&#39;t do it if it&#39;s symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">you know truly symbolic and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">old-fashioned ai sense then probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">you know ten computers call it five</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">thousand dollars worth</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">will be enough but as i suspect if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:38.560" style="s2">some hybrid between the two</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">and kind of messy and has some very low</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.560" end="00:15:42.079" style="s2">level stuff and some very high</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">level stuff and some transducers between</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.079" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">them it may be on the order you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t my best guess and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">you know i think ben thinks my number is</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.199" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">these computers and this is a tremendous</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">human-like for me the fascinating thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:01.360" style="s2">is that they get so far</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">that you have this a relatively simple</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">that are basically uh surviving a type</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">say this is not the way humans do it at</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">all and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">i had looked quite a bit at gpt2 i</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">and i did some experiments etc and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have fooled me for very long</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">apparently could fool some people but</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">that allow us how to understand the</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">over uh gpd2 so basically uses</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:37.440" style="s2">so it seems that you you can</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">works by certain rules like if you take</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">perfect and normal and stereotypical</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2">is is probably not realistic right we</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">know what happens if one percent of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">and so this is a universe that is only</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">and uh this is an interesting</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">producing a universe that is derived</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">from our standard universe with all the</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:20.720" style="s2">only changes very few things by leaving</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">and this would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">benchmark to see how many layers of</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">gpt 3 distinguish between construct</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">versus gpt2</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">uh with respect to the complexity of a</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:42.240" style="s2">uh i think it&#39;s possible that the unit</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">is not the new one</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">but that it&#39;s the column it might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">that this is a simplification and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">actual units are somewhat orthogonal to</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">so in some sense you have units that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">made from</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">columns you have some that are made from</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">multiple columns and a couple neurons</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">and you have some where the neuron and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">the couple neuro column and a couple</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">neurons interact in a specific way</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">or you could have processes inside of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">the new one that play an important role</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">that you need to understand in order to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.840" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">model the behavior of that thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">similar to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">understanding the role of people in</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">society but there</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">at a certain level of granularity you</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have people you just have</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">and yet to understand the interplay of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">the organization sometimes you need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">look at individual people that play the</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">and uh to understand the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">these people sometimes you need to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">very particular things in their own mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">that happened in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">moment in history and without that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">cannot understand it so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.279" style="s2">simple granularity that that we put on</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">on the model</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.279" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">it&#39;s often too coarse to to make it</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">happen but if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">just entertain the idea that columns</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">might be the thing because there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">somewhat ubiquitous over the neocortex</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">they are interchangeable you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">basically cut out</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">non-specialized columns from the brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">of an</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:05.200" style="s2">infant mouse and transplant them to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">another area of the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">in their take they will adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">fulfilling the role of that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">cortex</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">so the columns seem to be pretty general</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">as far as we know right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">and column is something like 300 to 400</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">neurons</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">so we end up with uh something like in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">the order of 100 million units and if</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">you imagine we have give or take 50</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">brain areas</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:29.679" style="s2">it would mean that each of these brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">areas has in the order of a million</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.679" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">units</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">and the units can do way more than an</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">individual neuron can do even an</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">individual neuron would probably need a</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">three-layer network to</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">model it as a persopron but eventually</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">what they do is that each of them can</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">link up</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">potentially with a few thousand other</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">units</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">and these few thousand other units are</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">not what they&#39;re linked up permanently</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the address space</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">it&#39;s what they can talk to and each of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">them has a number of states that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">can have and dynamics that they can</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">undergo</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">set of functions they can model and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">limited what they can do</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">right and so if you imagine that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">understand that each column is something</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">like an adaptive agent that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">doing local reinforcement learning by</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">some policy</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s wired up into a global</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">architecture with the others</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">then maybe this does fit on a few larger</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">gpus already in real time</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">yep that could be now i want to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">something that i in my readings in your</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">and your talks and papers you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">100 million</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">columns as i recall from my reading i</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">actually did look it up this afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">there&#39;s probably more like 100 million</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">mini columns</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">and a million columns columns seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">made from multiple mini columns</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:46.400" style="s2">which ones are you talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">you&#39;re i was talking about melee columns</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">and the formation of columns is also</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:51.919" style="s2">different in different brains so for</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">instance if you look at a mouse brain</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.919" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">you will find that a large part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">neocortex</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">seems to model the activity of whiskers</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">okay yeah make sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">and uh so the input space of whiskers</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">the columns form together into macro</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">columns in a way which are</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:11.039" style="s2">almost like regions and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">the it&#39;s not like you could look in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.039" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">brain you see very clear-cut</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">cells that are uh it&#39;s just that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">have groups of neurons that have more</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">interconnectivity</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">among each other and you lump them</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">together in a column and you also find</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">that they coincide usually with the glia</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">cell around which they&#39;re formed</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s not by any means a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">very clear-cut architecture and seems to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">be possible that neighboring columns</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">fuse and perform functions together and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">so on under certain circumstances so</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot more messy i think when we</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">look into this in detail</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">so you look at the mini column as the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">closest thing to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">reasonably generic unit okay that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">yes but it&#39;s really something very</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">i&#39;m already squinting a lot and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">too much another thing that i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">to or put on my mental stack when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">mentioned it is the question</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">of whether we are just the least</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">thing that is generally intelligent in</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">nature and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">so i wonder is why there is nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">is obviously smarter than us in nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">because evil for a monkey it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">have a brain that is larger than ours</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:18.799" style="s2">there are brains in nature that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">larger than ours right whales have</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">larger brains elephants have larger</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">brains</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">why is it that whales and elephants are</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">not smarter than us because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">basically carry these brains around for</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">free right they have so large bodies</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">that they scaled up the brain with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">body size and it&#39;s not that they need a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">proportionally larger cortex</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">to control a proportionally larger</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">muscle this is true for the body map but</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">only a very small part of the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">your somatosensory cortex</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">so what do they do with all this extra</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">why is it that they are not that smart</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">i suspect that if you make a system too</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">smart</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to control it it could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">that elephants have</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">uh massive autism because if they uh the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">non-autistic elephants meditated</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">themselves out of existence</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">they basically started to understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">their role in the universe like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">very smart monks and then as a result</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">they decided that uh doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">office politics all day and having kids</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">and participating in society</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">is just not cutting it and instead they</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">just go to do something more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">with their lives like meditating</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">and these elephants didn&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">offspring who knows that is the question</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">so i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">if this is a crazy idea i like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">it is a very crazy idea that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">that&#39;s i like that i&#39;m going to lay that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">one on somebody and say</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">oh yeah we only have autistic elephants</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">because elephants would otherwise be so</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">smart that they would you know be too</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">busy philosophizing to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">i mean with the dolphins it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s slightly different that dolphins</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">they live under water and you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">really hold a pen</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">underwater because everything you write</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">down will be washed out</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">so there will be no uh life for</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">because they cannot read it right</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">underwater so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">dolphins all only talk about sports and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">celebrities and sex</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:09.440" style="s2">and their society is not moving anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">and they have three dimensions too</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.440" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing you know it</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">requires</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">a better brain to operate in three</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">dimensions at the speeds they operate at</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">but navigation is so much easier right</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">solve all these not puzzles you can just</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:25.120" style="s2">move where you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s collisions are much</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.120" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">less likely right when you&#39;re stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">two dimensions collisions are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">undermined three dimensions it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">to dodge</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">right yes you&#39;ll probably also notice</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">that self-driving airplanes are</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">completely common</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">and standard for many many decades now</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">while self-driving cars are</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">difficult yep that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">because the navigation that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">do on the ground to coordinate with all</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">the other things that are limited to two</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">and have so many crossing paths are just</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">harder yep i love that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">yes or geometry and cognition come</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:55.679" style="s2">together and that&#39;s exactly the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">let&#39;s jump back a little bit to a point</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">you passed over rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">but i would love to dig into a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">bit which is your statement that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">in your belief the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">are sufficiently answered to to proceed</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">what is your take on the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">are you a strict materialist i suspect</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">that there is a misunderstanding with</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:20.640" style="s2">respect to what</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">matter means i found that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.640" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">think that matter is immediately given</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">somehow that we</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">and when we look at this in more detail</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">it just turns out that what we mean by</p>

<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">is a way to talk about information</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">and what we specifically talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">the way that we can measure change and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">we notice that we can measure changes</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">and we can see how these periodic</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">across locations and this is what we</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">is what we call physics right so physics</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.600" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">what&#39;s the close</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">hypothesis is that this layer exists and</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">can be described or inferred is a very</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">and this hypothesis doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">really good contender there is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">another game in town that is quite</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">and what would that other game look like</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:32:58.960" style="s2">and typically we</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">confronted with the notion of idealism</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.960" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">matter being primary and matter being</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.600" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">in something like a mathematical space</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">we think that the mind is possibly</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.360" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">primary so the conscious experience is</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">primary and subjectively that&#39;s true</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">the physical universe is smeared out and</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">with respect to that it has a very vague</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">and weird relationship to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">experiential noun that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">immediately given and if we make the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">step to say that this experiential now</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">is everything where</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">in the physical universe there&#39;s nothing</p>

<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">be confronted with a reality because in</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">physics there&#39;s just automata</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">is in a dream it&#39;s in here with us in</p>

<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">if we make that thing primary there</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">still needs to be an outside that dreams</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">what is the thing that dreams us that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">produces the dream that you&#39;re part of</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">and that thing out there this outside</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">world that we cannot access</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">this is still physics if we are dreamt</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">on a higher plane of existence then it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">turns out that this higher plane of</p>

<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">is still the skull of a primate with a</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:44.159" style="s2">be modeled with the ideas of physics</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not changing anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.159" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">yeah but is that necessary or when we</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">talk about let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:51.599" style="s2">human minds emerging from brains you</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">i think you know there is a physics out</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">there and physics</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">emerges to chemistry and chemistry is</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">stable and predictable and from</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">chemistry we get biochemistry and from</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">get neurons and then neurons we</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">eventually get nervous systems</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">we get brains and at some point probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">around the time of the reptiles or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">the amphibians we finally got</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">mind which is the subjective state</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:31.920" style="s2">then mind is a new subjective state</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">that is packaged within physics i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the alternative way of looking at</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">and you write books and discuss</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">how they interact and so on</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">and you never ever venture out to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">describe physics for some reason right</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessary to do so</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">because you do not intend to</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">and invent new means of production make</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">outside is something like a periodic</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">would you want to look into physics</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to do that right so many</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">and our culture is a little bit weird</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.320" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">because our civilization is not that old</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">i think it just started 400 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">and we are mostly unaware of that</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.599" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">because it was in some sense an</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:11.280" style="s2">and what we did was we freed our</p>

<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">for the first time in thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">and this new rational society that woke</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">up with the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">dismissed all the stories about the mind</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">that the christians had ever told them</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.000" style="s2">and thought of them as superstition so</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">we last lost many concepts and we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">still in the process of restoring them</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">for instance i&#39;m fond of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">spirit is a word that we have dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">now as superstitious and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s an old word that just means</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">operating system for an</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">autonomous robot and when the word was</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">coined it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">meant that the autonomous robots that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">existed</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">so there were people there were plants</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">cities nation states even possibly</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">but this was it there were no robots</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">that people had built</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">and now that we have autonomous robots</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">and they have operating systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:03.839" style="s2">we understand that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">like an operating system and that humans</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">must have one too and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">plants must have one as well and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">obviously societies and civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">have some kind of operating system right</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">and we understand that this operating</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">system of society is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">is not real it&#39;s virtual it exists over</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">coherent interactions of individuals in</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">the society in the same sense as the</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">does not exist as a physical thing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">exists over the coherent interactions</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">of the neurons or whatever are the</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">are yeah well i think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">important distinction and you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">study of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">the way i will often say that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">reductionist science you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">let&#39;s call it old-style science is about</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">the dancers</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">while complexity perspective is about</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">and the dancers right so the things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">hold together let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">a business company they&#39;re virtual</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">they&#39;re abstract</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">you know that you can&#39;t put your finger</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">on a particle and say this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">the operating system of a business and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">yet the business is real</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">it is a series of coordinated actions</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">operating on signals with boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">semi-permeable membranes</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">it has feedback loops i think that&#39;s key</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">and you make that point as well in some</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">of your writings that feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">are absolutely critical in creating</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">higher levels of complexity and systems</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.359" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">at least they appear to be you know for</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">instance in one of my critiques of our</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:44.720" style="s2">and that has produced many of the less</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">pull and push against each other and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">keep it in some dynamic balance</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">and uh and so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">classical notion and it became the core</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.839" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">of cybernetics and control theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">and it was a very popular paradigm for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">very long time</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.079" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">but i also suspect that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">little bit of traditional superstition</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">around the first and second generation</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">of dynamical systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">especially second order cybernetics in</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">the sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">attempted to think of these dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">systems as real</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:30.880" style="s2">and i suspect that they are just models</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">they are not real</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.880" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">they are the behavior of too many parts</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">to count in the limit</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">when we describe how individual things</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.359" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">interact we can often track them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">see the low level processes that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">change the evolution of one system</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">across the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">of uh by another and if you can no</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">longer do that because you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">trillions of molecules for instance you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">you will have to resort to models that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">the statistical dynamics of these too</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">many parts to count</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:03.520" style="s2">and some of the resulting mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">have convergent results</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">and others have not and the geometry of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">the world that we&#39;re looking at when we</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">look at dynamical systems this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">typically the stuff that is convergent</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">where we</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">can make models and so turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.079" style="s2">newtonian mechanics is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">these convergent dynamics of too many</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.079" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">parts to count within certain ranges</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not real because you cannot really</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:25.760" style="s2">make newtonian mechanics perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.760" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">from individual parts it&#39;s only within a</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">certain region of many many parts</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">too many parts to count that you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">something that looks a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">newtonian mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:40.079" style="s2">and for a different region it&#39;s true for</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">einsteinian mechanics right</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.079" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">but these systems are not real it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">a level of the modeling</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">that gives you coherence so when you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:50.800" style="s2">an observer and you zoom into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.040" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">universe that contains you and the many</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">many parts that make up yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">you basically will often find layers of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">description</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">where you can make a coherent model and</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:02.240" style="s2">these are the ones that we latch on as</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">description layers and then we discover</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.240" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">that they form a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">and then we try to establish causal</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">relationships between them</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">but these false relationships are not</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">causal relationships that exist in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:14.160" style="s2">physical universe</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">personality is a model category it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.160" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">property of the models that we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.599" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">so when we talk about these big</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">conundrums like the mind-body problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not talking about how is one</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">physical set of things</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">like bodies connected to one other</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">possibly non-physical set of things</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">minds what we have to talk about is we</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">have here one category of model</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">that is our body map that is dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">arranged in space and articulated with</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">skeletal muscles</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">and on the other hand you have mental</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">states and mental processes and software</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">states and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">and these two disparate categories of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">how can we make them congruent well</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">they&#39;re actually they obviously</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">have to operate together you know i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">going to give an example</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">about what does reality and models</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">really mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">we talked earlier about companies right</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">that they&#39;re virtual</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t really put your finger on</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">saying that&#39;s the company right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">standing wave essentially of action and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">but they&#39;re real in the sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:14.800" style="s2">have traction in the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s i think a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.800" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">assessment of what is real</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">as an example think of a coal mining</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">company a company who digs coal out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:23.119" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">so in terms of traction in the real</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.119" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">world they dig holes</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">and they deliver coal to people who turn</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">it into energy so there are actual</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">things that are done in the world by</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">this virtual thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">called the coal mining company and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">obviously trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.000" style="s2">track that at the level of atoms would</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">be ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">and even tracking it at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">human beings would be exceedingly</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:48.800" style="s2">and would maybe if you had billions of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">dollars you could simulate a coal mining</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.800" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">company at the level of individual</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">but interestingly at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">abstraction of accounting</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">it&#39;s quite simple right and people make</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:01.119" style="s2">large bets</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">based on the future of one coal mining</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">company versus another</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:07.119" style="s2">based on the signal very abstract very</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">high level of accounting information</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.119" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">that comes out</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">and the result is company a gets smaller</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:13.520" style="s2">and company b</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">gets bigger based on people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.520" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">assessments of this high-level</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">and yet at the end of the day we have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">say that the mining company is real</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">because it is having very significant</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:27.839" style="s2">impact on the real world well not</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:29.359" style="s2">everything that has a significant impact</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.839" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">on the real world is real</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.359" end="00:46:33.280" style="s2">in the in a particular sense right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">you could say that ideas have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.280" end="00:46:38.160" style="s2">significant impact</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">on on the real world and it&#39;s very often</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">difficult to say what the idea actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">is because it only exists approximately</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">minds right so if you think about a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.599" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">political movement</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">how would you say that the political</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">movement itself is real if the idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">behind the political movement is</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">understood by most people in different</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">ways but for a company it&#39;s much much</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">easier because we have a software uh our</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">legal system</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">that defines the conditions under which</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">a company exists</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">right and so you have a criterion by</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">which you can decide whether the company</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">is there or not</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">because we have created</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s similar to what happens in our</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">deterministic system</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">with clear rules that allow us to decide</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">and this allows us to construct</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">is still somewhat probabilistic yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">i would say that is true but it also</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:49.119" style="s2">seems to be</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">you make the good point that the fact</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">far because of the limits of the law so</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">at some level they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:31.280" style="s2">of the mining company perhaps in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">same way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.280" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">the fact that neurons while they of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">course they vary</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:38.000" style="s2">there&#39;s at least 100 different varieties</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.000" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">that different compared to non-neurons</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:44.400" style="s2">right they are</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">and they give evolution something to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.520" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">work with to produce</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">higher level emergencies in this case</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">and we take mind to be not just human</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">minds but minds all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">to wherever minds first come into being</p>

<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s interesting an</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">important thought that</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">we typically have a level of emergence</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:11.920" style="s2">that has relative simplicity at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">outer</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">envelope of the component pieces at that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">level and that those combining</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">allow us to reach the next level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">but we also know that the rules that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">implemented in the world that are so</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">uniform and so on for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:29.760" style="s2">financial system needs to be in order to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">work to be implemented in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.760" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">rather uniform</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t have large opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">arbitrage right</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:38.720" style="s2">where they have leaky abstractions and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">yet we both know people that got</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.720" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">extremely wealthy by specifically</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">looking for the fine print</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:46.079" style="s2">absolutely and not of these no systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">are perfect right biology</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.079" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">is subject to attack by viruses for</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">instance right a virus is not actually a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">biological entity</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s essentially a flaw in biological</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">that they&#39;re exploited by dead chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">in the same sense that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">arbitrage yours are essentially like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">virus operating on</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">business looking for the flaws in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">system and there will always be them</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">so the two interesting questions one is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:12.240" style="s2">how much fine print is there in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.240" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">in to which degree does the mind not</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">emerge over the activity of neurons for</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">instance to which degree is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">simplification and uh to which do we is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">it a very good abstraction and should</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">guide all of our thinking and not and</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">there are some people which</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">uh feel that the neurons are not the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">right description at all and might have</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:33.440" style="s2">even superstition connected to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s still worth keeping</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.440" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">that in the back of the mind so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">there is usually some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">fine print involved when we make such</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:42.400" style="s2">models and circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">under which this is not the entire truth</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.400" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">and more interesting things are going on</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">with respect to viruses right the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">coronavirus is not a life form it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">like a text</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">that the cell cannot help itself not to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">and when the cell reads this text it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">doomed because it cannot</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">sandbox the idea that is contained in</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">the text it will have to turn it into an</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">and these viruses exist also in society</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">in a way right</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:09.359" style="s2">but it&#39;s not as if the cell or the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">biological life</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.359" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">ever existed for a long time at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.599" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">without these viruses</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">these viruses have been around briefly</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">after cells came into being probably so</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">the cells already contain a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:24.160" style="s2">viruses the all the existing cells are</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">the result of many many interactions</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.160" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">that they had with viruses many of which</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:30.319" style="s2">permanently migrated into the cells that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">later on divided and became</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">us right so the same thing is true for</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">societies a lot of the ideas that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">are the result of the interaction with</p>

<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">natural convergence rather than</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">being an infection process that</p>

<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">and then took roots in there and formed</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">an immune system to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">competing ideas don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">take root in the same mind and so on</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">exactly i&#39;ve often used the term memetic</p>

<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">challenge the status quo</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">you know for instance the scientific</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.119" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">constrained makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">there&#39;s of course the question whether</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:45.359" style="s2">the virus increases the fitness</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:47.040" style="s2">of the individual in the group and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.359" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">seems to be quite obvious that if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">look at society that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">uh viral evolution the memetic evolution</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">does not necessarily have to lead to</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">improvements nor does the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">biological ones don&#39;t either right in</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:00.079" style="s2">the long run i think that the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.079" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">don&#39;t work out are uh going to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:06.400" style="s2">removed from the playing field this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:08.400" style="s2">how evolution works</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.400" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">but it can be a temporary breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.400" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">complexity that you observe so it could</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">be for instance that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">have a species that spreads over a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">large area of your ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">and is very homogenous and this makes it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">very susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">an infection and then the entire</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:25.599" style="s2">population gets or large part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.720" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">population gets</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.599" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">wiped out by a relatively simple attack</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:31.040" style="s2">vector</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">and if you have more diversity across</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:35.760" style="s2">species you have more resilience</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:37.200" style="s2">against viruses and the same thing can</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.760" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">happen in a society so</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.200" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">everybody is using the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">social media and the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">news sources then society can have very</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">homogeneous virus infections</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">and as long as the virus is adaptive in</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">the sense that it makes the group</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">coordinate better</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:55.200" style="s2">it can even convey an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">advantage on the group and make the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.200" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">group out compete other groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">so i wonder to which degree we are the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">result of such a viral domestication</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">process that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:05.599" style="s2">we basically are living in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">civilization that has</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.599" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">out-competed other civilizations because</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">people in it</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">they&#39;re very susceptible to this same</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">mind viruses</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:17.839" style="s2">and as long as the viruses of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:19.839" style="s2">accompanied with some kind of church</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.839" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">and an immune system like an inquisition</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.839" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">that would make sure that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">be susceptible to the same viruses and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">not rogue viruses</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:29.599" style="s2">right the society is possibly more</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.599" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">successful than other societies</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.599" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">and then if you remove the church and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">you have all these superstitious people</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">individual epistemology in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:39.119" style="s2">firewall against rogue ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:41.520" style="s2">that have no chance of being true when</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.119" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">seen uh edited with bright eyes</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.520" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">that this might create a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:46.799" style="s2">situation where your society just falls</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">apart because it splinters off into</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.799" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">random cults</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re running that experiment right</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">now right possible</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s also possible that everybody just</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">suddenly seeing the light at the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">time right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">this amazing thing happens that after a</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">several thousand years of human</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">evolution we suddenly get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.319" style="s2">where we have the right moral opinion</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:09.040" style="s2">about everything that we didn&#39;t have in</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.319" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.040" end="00:55:15.920" style="s2">1500s or in the 1800s or in</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">the 1950s or the 1970s or 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.920" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">now we see it of course everybody thinks</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">that they always think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:23.520" style="s2">right every epoch thinks that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.520" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">i do think that one of the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">experiment that we&#39;re running of memetic</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">viruses everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:34.400" style="s2">and eliminating many of the quality</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">control mechanisms that more autocratic</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">regimes have</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">may destroy us or may take us in a phase</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:40.640" style="s2">change to the new level</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know what some friends of</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.640" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">mine myself are working on is can we get</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">to a new level of civilization well</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">not all of our answers will be the right</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">ones but they&#39;ll be a lot more right</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">than the status quo in particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">learning how to operate within the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">limits of our ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">the current status quo seems to have no</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.319" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">breaks on it it does not know how to</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">it keeps producing new things whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">they&#39;re actually good for us or not and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">indeed many of them are dangerous to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">continued existence of the human race</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">think nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">just finished reading this weekend a</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">very interesting book by</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">william perry and another fella</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:16.799" style="s2">reminding us</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">there are still way too many nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.799" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">weapons out there and if there should be</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">just a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">it could knock us back to the stone age</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">quite easily right</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">let alone things like crispr or ai risk</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">etc which we&#39;ll talk about in a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:30.559" style="s2">bit so</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:32.799" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s interesting but let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.559" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">back to our topic a little bit here</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.799" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">and let&#39;s go all the way back in time in</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">fact before modernism</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.319" end="00:56:41.280" style="s2">really got started right at the cusp</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">with renee descartes and dualism</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.280" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">dualism seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">strong attractor to this very day right</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">and a place against that a view of</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">talking about consciousness here</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">essentially or the mind or the spirit or</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:56:58.720" style="s2">whatever we want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">descartes of course famously believed it</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.720" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">was of a different substance</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">than the body or energy or signals it</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:05.440" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">you know literally something very</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.440" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">unclear on how it interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:10.400" style="s2">the physical universe but it was of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:12.720" style="s2">different substance</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.400" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">while someone like john searle who i</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.720" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">have found to be one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">interesting philosophers of</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:24.960" style="s2">is nothing but an emergent system from</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.960" end="00:57:30.000" style="s2">very much like digestion and like</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">you know those two seem to be the poles</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">of our historical thinking and yet the</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">dualism still seems with us i wonder to</p>

<p begin="00:57:44.799" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">basically simplified his</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">when you look at occasionalism</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">the question of how the spheres interact</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">and the physical sphere can interact</p>

<p begin="00:58:07.440" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">is getting into your dream and messing</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">with it but how is the dream world</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.319" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">there must be a reason why descartes</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:24.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t see this as a very big problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">also what i find is when i read his</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.720" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">texts</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">he is often smarter than people give him</p>

<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">for instance in the meditations he will</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.720" end="00:58:34.240" style="s2">interact with religion</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">in the same way as somebody saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">communism might interact with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">political dogma that is he will make a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">nod to it</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:47.200" style="s2">and pretend to see no reason to doubt it</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">and but will it defend it with this</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.200" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">implosively weave arguments</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">so that everybody who is able to uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">to get to the to a certain point in</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.480" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">their own thinking realize</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">this is not an argument that is good</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">enough to actually make a point</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">that this person is highly incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">to make then you only need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">make the next step and understand oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">maybe descartes was smart enough to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">understand this</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">as well and smart enough to understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">that i would possibly be smart enough as</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.520" end="00:59:14.799" style="s2">well to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">so we now we got this out of the way and</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.799" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">understand why he wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">right there is a reading of the card</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">that is relatively straightforward and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:23.440" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">that both substances are mental</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.440" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">substances in a way</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">so res extensor is the thing that for</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">instance jeff hawkins</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">numenta is so obsessed with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">everything that happens in the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:39.200" style="s2">in some sense a representation</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">that maps to a certain region in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.200" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">same three-dimensional space</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">the same free space is here a model</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">space that our mind models about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:50.559" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">and this interpretation of jeff hawkins</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.559" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">is not complete because our mind also</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">has a lot of content that does not refer</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">to anything in the same moving free</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">so if you would say these two categories</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:04.000" style="s2">of mental thought the physics engine</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:04.480" style="s2">that our brain is generating to deal</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.000" end="01:00:06.400" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.480" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">predicting sensory data across all</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.400" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">modalities and all</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2">modalities will be mapped on that</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">physics engine right everything that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">hear and see and touch is mapped onto</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:18.079" style="s2">the same three space</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:20.319" style="s2">and all the other things this would be</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.079" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">your skogi tens this is not res extensor</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.319" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">so just</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">say res extensor is the physics engine</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:27.200" style="s2">that your mind is generating</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:29.040" style="s2">whereas cognitives is everything else</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.200" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">and now you can easily see how they</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.040" end="01:00:32.720" style="s2">interact</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">who&#39;s our software yeah i want to hop</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.720" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">back to a comment you made earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">the mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">not being causally closed do we know</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">is it possible the mind is causally</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">closed it&#39;s just very complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:48.240" style="s2">the question is what kind of causation</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">you observe in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.240" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">this was an idea that first occurred to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">me when i was</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:57.440" style="s2">a kid and was playing on on telnet</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">there was a class of computer games</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.440" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">which were called nuts they still exist</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">in a way but most of them are now</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">graphical</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">multi-user dungeon adventures and many</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">of them were implemented in an</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">object-oriented language that allowed</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">you to create an arbitrary world from</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">text and this was very much like a text</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">adventure but it was a text adventure</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">that was dynamically evolving</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">and in which people could interact</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">across many computers so they would log</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.040" end="01:01:23.839" style="s2">into the same server</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">and each of them would have a virtual</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.839" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">character and avatar</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">that would play in that world and some</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">of the people advanced to the point</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:35.359" style="s2">where they would become wizards</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">and even gods and a wizard a magician is</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.359" end="01:01:40.160" style="s2">somebody who has</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">right access to the rules of reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.160" end="01:01:43.920" style="s2">somebody who cannot just use the surface</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:46.799" style="s2">layer of reality that</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.920" end="01:01:47.520" style="s2">is producing its a certain mechanical</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.799" end="01:01:49.680" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.520" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">a certain substrate but you can go in</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">the substrate beneath that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">and the substrate beneath that change</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">the rules by which everybody else has to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:01:59.359" style="s2">right this is what magic is about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">also what magic is in a real world</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.359" end="01:02:04.240" style="s2">about a which is somebody who focuses on</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:05.119" style="s2">the way in which other people construct</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.240" end="01:02:07.599" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.119" end="01:02:09.440" style="s2">and messes directly with that layer so</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.599" end="01:02:11.920" style="s2">the people around the witch</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.440" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">will have a reality that is open to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.920" end="01:02:15.680" style="s2">attacks</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">by witchcraft by the right access to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.680" end="01:02:18.640" style="s2">attention of people</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:20.559" style="s2">to the way that people perceive their</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.640" end="01:02:21.200" style="s2">own relationship to reality into the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.559" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">bitch</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.200" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">there was the reason why the witches</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">have met the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:28.799" style="s2">similar fate under the expansion of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">christianity as the jews did under the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.799" end="01:02:32.480" style="s2">expansion of fascism</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a competing system of</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.480" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">seeing the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.359" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">that the dominant new vector did not</p>

<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:42.640" style="s2">so it tried to eradicate it so uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">witchcraft in these games existed right</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.640" end="01:02:45.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a way to make people perceive</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:47.280" style="s2">reality different by</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.599" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">changing rules by which people have to</p>

<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:52.880" style="s2">and interact with it and uh this</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">witchcraft exists in our mind there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.880" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">ways in which we can perceive miracles</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:02:58.400" style="s2">and make other people perceive miracles</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:01.039" style="s2">it comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.400" end="01:03:03.200" style="s2">creating a mental entity that you can</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.200" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">that is changing the other person&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:10.880" style="s2">and as soon as you notice that you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.359" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">edit your own memories and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.880" end="01:03:14.880" style="s2">catch yourself editing your own memories</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">uh you notice that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.880" end="01:03:19.680" style="s2">interaction the causality in your mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:22.559" style="s2">is symbolic there is stuff going on like</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">you uh perform a certain ritual that</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.559" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">involves maybe sacrificing a black cat</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">and as a result things in the real world</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">that are not obviously mechanically uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">connected to</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.440" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">the sacrifice of the black cat right</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a completely symbolic interaction</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:40.559" style="s2">the power of symbolic rituals can only</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">be explained i think by the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.559" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">our minds are not the course of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">closed doors layer</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">so you&#39;re saying that sacrificing the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">black cat actually does</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">cause a change in physical reality no</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">it must cause a change in you the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:03:56.559" style="s2">that you make sense of physical reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.119" end="01:03:58.000" style="s2">in the way that which you relate to</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.559" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">physical reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.000" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">your the model that you make and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:03.839" style="s2">actions that you perform as a result of</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">that change you regulate in a different</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.839" end="01:04:07.280" style="s2">way and as a result reality will now</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.599" end="01:04:09.760" style="s2">look different to you</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.280" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">that yes okay that certainly makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.760" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">so for instance you could make a ritual</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">to become</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">say a ceo of a company imagine you are a</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:19.280" style="s2">a person that is an employee of</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:21.119" style="s2">companies difficulty</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.280" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">to hold on to a job they are financially</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.119" end="01:04:24.400" style="s2">struggling and so on they really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.319" style="s2">know what to do about this and</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.400" end="01:04:27.680" style="s2">there is no way they can get out of this</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.319" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">they look into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:31.599" style="s2">all the rules of reality that exists and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:33.039" style="s2">they can look into economic theory and</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.599" end="01:04:33.760" style="s2">they realized i&#39;m a member of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">working class</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.760" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s nothing i can do about</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">this right and then they meet a magician</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:41.359" style="s2">and the magician says</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:43.200" style="s2">look we can do these rituals and a lot</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.359" end="01:04:44.079" style="s2">of people that offer this magic as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.200" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">service</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.079" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">they have this abundance meditation and</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:50.400" style="s2">expensive retreats and so on</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.240" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">and they basically reprogram you into</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.400" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">becoming a</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">say a glorified parasite or an</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">entrepreneur or an investor</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.680" end="01:04:59.680" style="s2">and the difference between an investor</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:01.200" style="s2">is not some magical ritual that has to</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.680" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">be performed at birth</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.200" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">or a change in the universe or a change</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">in the social order</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.400" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a change in how you relate to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:10.880" style="s2">world around you if you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:12.480" style="s2">basically change your expectations in</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:14.079" style="s2">such a way that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.480" end="01:05:16.640" style="s2">consider yourself to be a very different</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.079" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">system you can often gravitate to a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.640" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">different place in society and in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:21.520" style="s2">economic order</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.520" end="01:05:22.799" style="s2">right and suddenly you have this big</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.520" end="01:05:25.039" style="s2">house and this big car</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.799" end="01:05:26.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that you are working</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.039" end="01:05:28.160" style="s2">necessarily longer hours than you did</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.640" end="01:05:29.599" style="s2">before but you just interact with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.160" end="01:05:30.960" style="s2">outside world in a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.599" end="01:05:32.480" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.960" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">but you&#39;ve updated your code i mean it</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.480" end="01:05:35.680" style="s2">happens all the time and the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">happens say this relationship say you</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.680" end="01:05:40.720" style="s2">want to find the perfect partner or</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:42.799" style="s2">uh you want to meet very particular</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.720" end="01:05:44.559" style="s2">people and you perform a certain ritual</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">and that suddenly changes the way you</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.559" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">interact with reality and</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">as downstream effects also makes other</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.799" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:53.039" style="s2">interact with you in a different way and</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:55.039" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;ll find yourself in a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.039" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">different position in the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.039" end="01:06:00.480" style="s2">yep that&#39;s true but i&#39;m not sure about</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.240" end="01:06:02.160" style="s2">its significance if we assume that</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.480" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">something like a rough distinction</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.160" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">between hardware and software and i</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:07.359" style="s2">that there&#39;s actually many layers of</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:10.480" style="s2">software in the mind</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.359" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">to update your code and then therefore</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.480" end="01:06:14.640" style="s2">have a different degree of traction in</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:17.119" style="s2">the world than you did before doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.640" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">strike me as particularly mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.119" end="01:06:21.280" style="s2">you know if there is only one real layer</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s the layer below quantum</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.280" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.240" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">and everything above that is models</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.079" end="01:06:28.799" style="s2">there is a lot of ways in which we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:30.559" style="s2">meddle with these models to get the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.799" end="01:06:32.720" style="s2">outcome that we want</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.559" end="01:06:33.839" style="s2">but so far we have not found any such</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.720" end="01:06:37.599" style="s2">mechanisms to</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.839" end="01:06:39.359" style="s2">actually impact the level of physics</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.599" end="01:06:41.839" style="s2">all right we cannot change the mass of</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.359" end="01:06:42.720" style="s2">electrons by a witchcraft we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.839" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.720" end="01:06:46.400" style="s2">the spectral characteristics of alpha</p>

<p begin="01:06:46.400" end="01:06:50.240" style="s2">sacrificing a black cat exactly so there</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.520" end="01:06:52.720" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">a level at which reality is causally</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.720" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">closed at which magic is not possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">this was the point that was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:01.359" style="s2">make this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">that the world is entirely subject to</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.359" end="01:07:04.559" style="s2">symbolical magic</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:06.000" style="s2">falls apart at some point because there</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.559" end="01:07:08.480" style="s2">seems to be a layer</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.000" end="01:07:11.039" style="s2">outside of our minds that we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.480" end="01:07:14.559" style="s2">change where the rules do not change</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.039" end="01:07:16.160" style="s2">and the question between the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.559" end="01:07:17.680" style="s2">magicians between the people that think</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.160" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">that everything is a dream is</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.680" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">whether this is only because we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.280" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">agreed with each other that there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:24.720" style="s2">certain parts of the dream are immutable</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">and we cannot defect from that dream</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.720" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">because then we will go insane</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.240" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">uh from the outside and from the inside</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:32.319" style="s2">reality falls apart</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">just to sends it to chaos and of course</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.319" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:36.559" style="s2">disprove idealism right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.559" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">in that area where could be true just</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">seems unlikely to me</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.400" end="01:07:45.280" style="s2">and as i said i put my flag down many</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:47.280" style="s2">years ago as a naive realist which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.280" end="01:07:49.599" style="s2">there is a reality out there magic</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.280" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work on physical reality</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.599" end="01:07:52.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s not because we all agreed not</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:54.240" style="s2">to change this because it&#39;s just a</p>

<p begin="01:08:30.640" end="01:08:34.319" style="s2">and a group of ex-convicts that went to</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">a casino</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.319" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">and guess what they both won and lost at</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:39.759" style="s2">exactly the same rates once n was large</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.759" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">so you know these mine viruses that</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:46.880" style="s2">attempt to claim that they can</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">manipulate the universe</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.880" end="01:08:53.279" style="s2">but can&#39;t are a specific</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">example of what i might call malware</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">that the human brain is susceptible to</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:08:59.040" style="s2">very very susceptible to just think of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">the nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.040" end="01:09:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s loose in the world today about</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:04.719" style="s2">covid19 for instance</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.880" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">but you know i do believe that we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.719" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">use a sharp enough knife</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">and say you know this is just not true</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:12.799" style="s2">about reality</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:14.799" style="s2">so uh the occultist might say to you jim</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.799" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve locked yourself into a reality in</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.799" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">which you will never win the lottery</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:19.679" style="s2">because you</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:21.120" style="s2">have made that commitment in the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.679" end="01:09:22.400" style="s2">that you in which you constitute your</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.120" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">relationship to reality</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.400" end="01:09:26.719" style="s2">that you can never beat the odds right</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:28.640" style="s2">uh that magic is not possible</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.719" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to say whether that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.640" end="01:09:32.480" style="s2">for uh but when you compare the</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:34.319" style="s2">hypothesis from the outside</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.480" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">you can basically see which one leads</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.319" end="01:09:38.880" style="s2">into a consistent model of reality</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:40.640" style="s2">you can of course always perform magic</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.880" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">imagine you run a company and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.640" end="01:09:43.600" style="s2">in the company is depressed because the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:47.040" style="s2">numbers don&#39;t add up</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.600" end="01:09:48.719" style="s2">and uh they are pointing towards doom</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.040" end="01:09:50.400" style="s2">and then you hire a consultant and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.719" end="01:09:52.960" style="s2">consultant performs magic</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:54.640" style="s2">it changes the benchmark and suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:58.159" style="s2">everything is awesome again</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.640" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">right so you pay the consultant</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.159" end="01:10:01.679" style="s2">and now the question is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">to your company</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.679" end="01:10:05.600" style="s2">did the uh consultant oppose a better</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.920" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">model on your company by which it tracks</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.600" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">its performance in a better way</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:11.600" style="s2">and uh regulates in a better way or did</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.080" end="01:10:13.360" style="s2">they just cheat</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.600" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">and this is the issue with magic that a</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.360" end="01:10:16.480" style="s2">lot of magic comes down to cheating of</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:18.400" style="s2">course you can edit your memory and your</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.480" end="01:10:20.000" style="s2">expectations and your interpretations of</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.400" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">what happens in between</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.000" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">but it might also change the way that</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:26.000" style="s2">what you feel like for instance</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:27.440" style="s2">even if you feel terribly you can just</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.000" end="01:10:30.000" style="s2">imagine that you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.440" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">basically a king that presides over an</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:33.360" style="s2">awesome kingdom</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:35.199" style="s2">and that tomorrow is going to be awesome</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:36.159" style="s2">again and this is just a very very short</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.199" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">intermission</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.159" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">that is does not actually mean anything</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:40.560" style="s2">and this movement if you look at it from</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">this perspective is actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.560" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">bearable right</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:45.120" style="s2">from this perspective you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:46.560" style="s2">going to be a much happier person</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.120" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">but of course the question is in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.560" end="01:10:49.840" style="s2">long run uh how well do you track</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.480" end="01:10:51.600" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.840" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s say for instance you decide</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.600" end="01:10:55.840" style="s2">that i am the king of infinite space</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">and i decide i&#39;m not gonna work and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.840" end="01:10:59.120" style="s2">not going to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll end up starving to death</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:02.640" style="s2">right so at the end</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">reality bats last you know and i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.640" end="01:11:05.440" style="s2">again in in terms of public affairs you</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:08.400" style="s2">can claim</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.440" end="01:11:11.120" style="s2">that covid19 is a hoax but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.400" end="01:11:12.880" style="s2">stop the virus from doing its thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:14.560" style="s2">yes of course you can also do the</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.880" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2">opposite for instance</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.560" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">since my early use i think was early</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:20.719" style="s2">teens when i</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:21.920" style="s2">stumbled on the same thing as greta</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.719" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">toonberg did</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.920" end="01:11:27.600" style="s2">which the limits to growth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:29.440" style="s2">the environmental pollution that was you</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.600" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">know on a one-way trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.440" end="01:11:33.199" style="s2">and the fact that we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:34.480" style="s2">regulation mechanisms implemented in our</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.199" end="01:11:36.560" style="s2">civilization that could make it</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.480" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">sustainable before it breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.560" end="01:11:39.679" style="s2">and that seemed to be an obvious thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">right that we are</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.679" end="01:11:43.520" style="s2">instigating dynamics that when unchecked</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:44.640" style="s2">will lead to the demise of our</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.520" end="01:11:46.400" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.640" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">and our main defense against that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.400" end="01:11:50.080" style="s2">visual thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:52.159" style="s2">and once you realize that you get</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.080" end="01:11:53.760" style="s2">depressed right it&#39;s terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.159" end="01:11:55.600" style="s2">and the same thing is also true when you</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.760" end="01:11:58.239" style="s2">look at society you mostly</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.600" end="01:11:59.840" style="s2">focus on the things that get worse where</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.239" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">institutions gets understand where</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.840" end="01:12:02.719" style="s2">people defect from what they should be</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:05.040" style="s2">doing and all levels of</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.719" end="01:12:06.880" style="s2">responsibility and everything is</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.040" end="01:12:08.560" style="s2">constantly breaking down and getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.880" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">worse and this was my dominant</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.560" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">perspective for most of my life and i</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:14.239" style="s2">must say the world didn&#39;t disappoint</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">right there was always enough evidence</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.239" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">to support this worldview so i</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.920" end="01:12:19.920" style="s2">i spent my life being extremely worried</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:22.320" style="s2">i did the inverse to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.920" end="01:12:24.400" style="s2">king that thinks that what you see today</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.320" end="01:12:26.719" style="s2">is just a short intermission</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.400" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">of slightly unpleasant things happening</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.719" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">in a life that is overall totally</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:30.960" style="s2">glorious</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">i basically perceive the world as</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:34.239" style="s2">something that is pretty much miserable</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">where the past and the future are</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.239" end="01:12:38.320" style="s2">miserable</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:38.880" style="s2">and the present is quite bearable but</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.320" end="01:12:40.560" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.880" end="01:12:42.800" style="s2">an exception that will surely be</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.560" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">corrected in the near future</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.800" end="01:12:47.360" style="s2">right and this is an opposite distortion</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">that is unhealthy i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.360" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">though on the other hand i think your</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:51.280" style="s2">analysis is approximately true as we</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">talked about before</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.280" end="01:12:54.640" style="s2">that the current status quo seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:55.679" style="s2">in a runaway state where it is going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.640" end="01:12:58.080" style="s2">run over off a club</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.679" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">it totally is right 2020 is not an</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.080" end="01:13:01.360" style="s2">aberration it&#39;s exactly the future that</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.840" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">we always expected would</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.360" end="01:13:05.199" style="s2">start to manifest around 2020. and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:06.800" style="s2">starting and</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.199" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">and it&#39;ll get worse until we do</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.800" end="01:13:10.800" style="s2">something about it but we could have</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:12.480" style="s2">enjoyed the time in between so much more</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.800" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">that is true all right well that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.480" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">is interesting this is interesting but</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:17.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite on the main line of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:18.080" style="s2">topics i wanted to go through but it was</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.760" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.080" end="01:13:21.199" style="s2">interesting let&#39;s move back a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">more to</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.199" end="01:13:24.719" style="s2">some of the specifics of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">architectures</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.719" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">you know the nature of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:29.600" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:32.080" style="s2">and particularly i&#39;d love to talk a</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.600" end="01:13:35.199" style="s2">little bit about what your views are</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.080" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">on the gap between humans and other</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.199" end="01:13:39.120" style="s2">animals you know you alluded to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">that you know elephants have much bigger</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.120" end="01:13:41.920" style="s2">brains than we do</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:43.520" style="s2">whales do too some dolphins killer</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.920" end="01:13:45.280" style="s2">whales i think but</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.520" end="01:13:47.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t see you know elephants sitting</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.280" end="01:13:49.199" style="s2">around philosophizing</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.040" end="01:13:50.560" style="s2">and of course one of the theories and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.199" end="01:13:53.360" style="s2">probably the leading theory</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.560" end="01:13:55.600" style="s2">is the difference is that somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.360" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">along the line we added a new class</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.600" end="01:14:02.560" style="s2">of object into our brains something like</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:05.600" style="s2">symbols maybe or language of</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.560" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">thought or perhaps it was a more</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.600" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">powerful form of procedural memory that</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.480" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">allowed us for instance to</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:14.880" style="s2">conceptualize multi-part tools maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:16.239" style="s2">that was accepted for language but</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.880" end="01:14:19.040" style="s2">something in that space</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.239" end="01:14:20.880" style="s2">what are your thoughts from examining ai</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.040" end="01:14:22.800" style="s2">and cognitive science about this</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.880" end="01:14:24.640" style="s2">only one percent one and a half percent</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.800" end="01:14:25.520" style="s2">difference in genes between us and a</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.640" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">chimp and yet</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.520" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">seemingly a giant gap in terms of our</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:31.840" style="s2">cognitive ability</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:33.920" style="s2">so there is an experiment that would be</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.840" end="01:14:36.800" style="s2">very interesting to make and this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.920" end="01:14:38.800" style="s2">how smart can dogs be there are</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.800" end="01:14:42.080" style="s2">obviously extreme differences</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.800" end="01:14:45.040" style="s2">in the intelligence of dog breeds right</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.080" end="01:14:46.719" style="s2">and typically the small dogs that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.040" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">would like to have in our home tend to</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.719" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">be quite dumb</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:54.880" style="s2">and the dogs that we use to</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.239" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">hurt our sheep tend to be very smart but</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.880" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:59.920" style="s2">the drugs that hurt our sheep tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:00.480" style="s2">less controllable and they are less</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.920" end="01:15:03.040" style="s2">suitable</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.480" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">as uh to keep around because you need to</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.040" end="01:15:06.640" style="s2">negotiate the relationship to them</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.120" end="01:15:08.640" style="s2">at a more fundamental level they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.640" end="01:15:11.840" style="s2">somewhat less domesticated</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.640" end="01:15:12.480" style="s2">and harder to domesticate and homo</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.840" end="01:15:14.719" style="s2">sapiens</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.480" end="01:15:15.920" style="s2">also seems to be a domesticated woman in</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.719" end="01:15:17.199" style="s2">it i</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.920" end="01:15:19.440" style="s2">sometimes wonder whether the</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.199" end="01:15:20.320" style="s2">neanderthals were individually smarter</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.440" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">than us</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.320" end="01:15:24.320" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t have scalable tribes</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:26.960" style="s2">that that would scale into</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.320" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">states into societies with unknown</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.960" end="01:15:29.520" style="s2">numbers of individuals beyond the dunbar</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:32.719" style="s2">number</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:35.600" style="s2">and in order to get people to cooperate</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.719" end="01:15:37.520" style="s2">at scale you need to domesticate them in</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.600" end="01:15:38.000" style="s2">such a way that you would selectively</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.520" end="01:15:40.000" style="s2">dump them</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.000" end="01:15:41.040" style="s2">down to dump down the epistemology so</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:43.600" style="s2">they are able to</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.040" end="01:15:45.360" style="s2">believe the same thing without proof and</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.600" end="01:15:46.960" style="s2">walk on dog step</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.360" end="01:15:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting though i will point out</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.960" end="01:15:51.360" style="s2">that the confrontation between homo</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.880" end="01:15:53.600" style="s2">sapiens sapiens and neanderthal</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.360" end="01:15:55.280" style="s2">happened when we were still operating</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.600" end="01:15:56.640" style="s2">below the dunbar number</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.280" end="01:15:59.280" style="s2">you know that was obviously in our</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.640" end="01:16:01.679" style="s2">forager stage you know at the latest 36</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.280" end="01:16:02.800" style="s2">000 years ago so i&#39;m not sure i buy it</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.679" end="01:16:04.880" style="s2">with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.800" end="01:16:07.600" style="s2">neanderthal on the other hand it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.880" end="01:16:10.800" style="s2">fact that archaeologists tell me is true</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.600" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">that if you compare modern man to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.800" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">cro-magnon man say 12 000 years ago at</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:19.040" style="s2">the very end of our forager days</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">cro-magnon man&#39;s brain was 10 larger</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.040" end="01:16:23.840" style="s2">than ours</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:26.400" style="s2">exactly so uh what i wonder is if the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.840" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">evolutionary advantage that allowed us</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.400" end="01:16:30.800" style="s2">to displace the neanderthals</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.480" end="01:16:31.600" style="s2">to genocide them which is probably what</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.800" end="01:16:34.560" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.600" end="01:16:37.440" style="s2">was coordination it seems reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.560" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">cooperation is the human superpower</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.440" end="01:16:41.679" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s not just the way we</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.920" end="01:16:42.960" style="s2">cooperate in the sense that we make a</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.679" end="01:16:44.719" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.960" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">individually to cooperate with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.719" end="01:16:47.440" style="s2">else which what cooperation is usually</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.480" end="01:16:49.920" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.440" end="01:16:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s that we do this without thinking</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.920" end="01:16:54.000" style="s2">that we do this automatically</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.159" end="01:16:55.840" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting but again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.000" end="01:16:57.600" style="s2">really interested in the line between</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.840" end="01:16:59.440" style="s2">let&#39;s say humans and chimps</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.600" end="01:17:01.360" style="s2">right which is much bigger than between</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.440" end="01:17:03.040" style="s2">cro-magnon and neanderthal neanderthal</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.360" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">and chimps is gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.040" end="01:17:06.320" style="s2">too just a little bit smaller perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:08.000" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.320" end="01:17:09.520" style="s2">so the main issue seems to be lengths of</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.000" end="01:17:11.600" style="s2">childhood i suspect</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.520" end="01:17:14.080" style="s2">the length of our childhood is not too</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.600" end="01:17:16.719" style="s2">much given by social circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.080" end="01:17:18.400" style="s2">it does play a role but the main issue</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.719" end="01:17:20.400" style="s2">seems to be the mat speed of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.400" end="01:17:22.719" style="s2">maturation of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.400" end="01:17:24.719" style="s2">and uh what you see is that in ancestral</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.719" end="01:17:26.480" style="s2">societies it takes at least 15 years</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.719" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2">before you are able to forage more than</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.480" end="01:17:31.600" style="s2">you can eat</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.000" end="01:17:33.040" style="s2">and in our society this period is even</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.600" end="01:17:35.679" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.040" end="01:17:37.679" style="s2">right so uh the time by which a kid can</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.679" end="01:17:40.560" style="s2">basically earn more than it needs</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.679" end="01:17:43.199" style="s2">uh in terms of upkeep is typically</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.560" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">longer than 18 in our society</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.199" end="01:17:46.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very expensive period to</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:48.400" style="s2">maintain in which you</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">are mostly doing exploration instead of</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.400" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">exploitation</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:53.280" style="s2">and what we notice that in this period</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.920" end="01:17:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a decision that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.280" end="01:17:55.920" style="s2">individual is making to focus more on</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.120" end="01:17:57.520" style="s2">exploration</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.920" end="01:17:59.199" style="s2">the individual is in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.520" end="01:18:01.600" style="s2">literally insane it</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.199" end="01:18:03.440" style="s2">has an incomplete model of reality it</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.600" end="01:18:05.440" style="s2">has an incomplete architecture</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.440" end="01:18:07.360" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think this is just not</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.440" end="01:18:09.760" style="s2">because it has not learned enough yet</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.360" end="01:18:11.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s like the capstones are missing</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.760" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">it&#39;s like the training happens layer by</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.440" end="01:18:15.199" style="s2">layer</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">and the infant spends a longer time than</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.199" end="01:18:18.719" style="s2">cat infant</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:19.760" style="s2">to learn basic special relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.719" end="01:18:22.080" style="s2">learn contrast</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.760" end="01:18:23.600" style="s2">and object permanence and so on and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.080" end="01:18:25.360" style="s2">spends a longer time on</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.600" end="01:18:27.040" style="s2">engaging with social relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.360" end="01:18:30.000" style="s2">so on so you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:31.760" style="s2">that a cat a house cat can have a better</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.000" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">model of the social reality and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.760" end="01:18:35.280" style="s2">family and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:36.719" style="s2">capabilities and relationships of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.280" end="01:18:38.400" style="s2">individuals between them and then a</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.719" end="01:18:40.960" style="s2">two-year-old baby will have</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.400" end="01:18:42.560" style="s2">right and that&#39;s uh despite the baby</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.960" end="01:18:44.320" style="s2">obviously being in some sense much</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.560" end="01:18:46.400" style="s2">smarter when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.320" end="01:18:48.159" style="s2">spatial reasoning and so on even at that</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.400" end="01:18:48.800" style="s2">age and definitely in terms of using</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.159" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.800" end="01:18:52.800" style="s2">because most two-year-olds do have some</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:18:55.840" style="s2">kind of language that far surprises</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.800" end="01:18:56.560" style="s2">what a cat can do and so it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.840" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.560" end="01:19:00.800" style="s2">our ability might be conjunction of</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:01.600" style="s2">slightly larger brain and optimized</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.800" end="01:19:04.159" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.600" end="01:19:05.920" style="s2">but mostly more training data per day</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.159" end="01:19:08.719" style="s2">when we bootstrap our brains</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:10.159" style="s2">so we can make better abstractions and</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.719" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">that would be a very simple genetic</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.159" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">switch</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:14.400" style="s2">so you could have a genetic switch that</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.400" end="01:19:18.159" style="s2">delays childhood every phase of it makes</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:20.800" style="s2">it slower</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.159" end="01:19:22.880" style="s2">and as a result gives you smarter terms</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.800" end="01:19:23.360" style="s2">at the expense of longer childhood which</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.880" end="01:19:24.800" style="s2">means that</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.360" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">gyms need to have much better</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.800" end="01:19:28.239" style="s2">environmental circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.400" end="01:19:30.480" style="s2">and more benefit from exploiting these</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.239" end="01:19:33.520" style="s2">circumstances especially</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.480" end="01:19:35.040" style="s2">so i suspect that moving into temperate</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.520" end="01:19:36.000" style="s2">zones where you have a benefit from</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.040" end="01:19:39.280" style="s2">planning ahead so you</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.000" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">can make agriculture and decide that if</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.280" end="01:19:41.760" style="s2">you put stuff in the ground now it might</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:43.840" style="s2">sprout</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.760" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">and if you keep a certain fraction of</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.840" end="01:19:47.280" style="s2">the stuff that you</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:48.239" style="s2">will not eat as seedlings for the next</p>

<p begin="01:19:48.239" end="01:19:52.320" style="s2">for years in which you have less</p>

<p begin="01:19:52.320" end="01:19:56.480" style="s2">all these planning ahead and so on is</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:19:58.400" style="s2">going to give huge benefit</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.480" end="01:19:59.920" style="s2">to a long childhood it allows you to</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.400" end="01:20:03.280" style="s2">generalize over a very very</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.920" end="01:20:04.080" style="s2">time spans interesting and then of</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.280" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">course humans</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.080" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">of course this is just one of these just</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:08.800" style="s2">so stories about evolution so it may not</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:10.639" style="s2">be true but</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.800" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">you know one of the theories is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.639" end="01:20:14.000" style="s2">once we started standing on two feet</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:16.719" style="s2">bipedalism</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.000" end="01:20:18.560" style="s2">it produced evolution that constricted</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.719" end="01:20:21.440" style="s2">the opening of the pelvis</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.560" end="01:20:22.960" style="s2">that limited the size of the head of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.440" end="01:20:25.920" style="s2">human baby</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.960" end="01:20:27.520" style="s2">and hence while there was seemingly</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.920" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">something going on with rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.520" end="01:20:32.560" style="s2">increasing brain size when our brains</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:33.440" style="s2">are almost three times the size of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.560" end="01:20:35.280" style="s2">chimp brain</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.440" end="01:20:36.800" style="s2">even though we have similar body size</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.280" end="01:20:38.639" style="s2">we&#39;re a little bigger body size but not</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.800" end="01:20:41.040" style="s2">anywhere close to 3x</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.639" end="01:20:41.840" style="s2">the constraint was the pelvis</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.040" end="01:20:44.719" style="s2">arrangement</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.840" end="01:20:45.440" style="s2">in the bipedal method of getting around</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.719" end="01:20:48.320" style="s2">and hence</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.440" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">the evolutionary adaptation was to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.320" end="01:20:53.440" style="s2">delivered very very very prematurely so</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:56.000" style="s2">that we required a much longer time</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.440" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">to fully develop our brains unlike</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.000" end="01:20:59.920" style="s2">actually the model animal i use in my</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:01.520" style="s2">cognitive science work is a deer</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.920" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">white-tailed deer</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.520" end="01:21:05.280" style="s2">and white-tailed deer is fairly</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:07.360" style="s2">competent two hours after it&#39;s born</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.280" end="01:21:10.239" style="s2">right it can get up it can walk around</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.360" end="01:21:10.719" style="s2">it can find its mother it can flee from</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.239" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">prey</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.719" end="01:21:14.880" style="s2">not very well but at least a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.800" end="01:21:16.239" style="s2">compared to a two hour old baby can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.880" end="01:21:19.440" style="s2">a damn thing right</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.239" end="01:21:20.159" style="s2">because the deer pelvis allows a much</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.440" end="01:21:22.960" style="s2">larger</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.159" end="01:21:23.360" style="s2">baby relative to the size of the mother</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.960" end="01:21:25.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.360" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">they have not been under evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.040" end="01:21:29.280" style="s2">pressure for really large brains either</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:32.000" style="s2">so maybe that is the causal factor</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.280" end="01:21:32.800" style="s2">of this very long learning process which</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.000" end="01:21:34.080" style="s2">is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.800" end="01:21:36.480" style="s2">the very interesting point you make</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.080" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">about however we got there the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.480" end="01:21:40.960" style="s2">we have a very long maturity period</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.120" end="01:21:43.360" style="s2">would tell us that we have more training</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.960" end="01:21:44.560" style="s2">cases to run more layers to build and</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.360" end="01:21:47.520" style="s2">more abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.560" end="01:21:49.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s interesting having a large</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.520" end="01:21:51.280" style="s2">brain is super nice i also</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.360" end="01:21:53.280" style="s2">see some people that are obviously super</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.280" end="01:21:55.520" style="s2">smart like say john dared and stephen</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.280" end="01:21:56.239" style="s2">warfram it also have extraordinary large</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.520" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">scales</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.239" end="01:21:59.920" style="s2">so it seems to be possible to have a</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:00.560" style="s2">little bit more levee in the human</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.920" end="01:22:02.400" style="s2">pelvis</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.560" end="01:22:04.639" style="s2">to get larger skulls out there and</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.400" end="01:22:07.120" style="s2">sometimes it also has good results</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.639" end="01:22:07.840" style="s2">we also find people that have brains</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.120" end="01:22:09.840" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.840" end="01:22:11.760" style="s2">similar to say a gorilla brain and these</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.840" end="01:22:13.520" style="s2">people are not necessarily mentally</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.760" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">impaired in any way they can</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.520" end="01:22:17.120" style="s2">hold down a job they often study at</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:19.920" style="s2">university and</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.120" end="01:22:20.400" style="s2">can be reasonably smart people right so</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.920" end="01:22:22.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.400" end="01:22:24.239" style="s2">size of the brain is not absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.560" end="01:22:26.400" style="s2">everything there is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.239" end="01:22:28.480" style="s2">certain devay in which you can use it</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.400" end="01:22:29.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s probably nice to have a brain</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.480" end="01:22:31.679" style="s2">that scales up better</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.760" end="01:22:34.159" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think that brain size by</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.679" end="01:22:36.480" style="s2">itself is the deciding factor</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.159" end="01:22:38.159" style="s2">what about the theory that symbols or</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.480" end="01:22:41.280" style="s2">language per se</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.159" end="01:22:43.840" style="s2">is the bright line yeah i wonder about</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.280" end="01:22:46.000" style="s2">this that&#39;s a very tempting idea and it</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.840" end="01:22:48.000" style="s2">seems to be that the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.000" end="01:22:50.159" style="s2">do grammatical decomposition is</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.000" end="01:22:54.080" style="s2">something that distinguishes</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.159" end="01:22:56.719" style="s2">the ability of humans and other apes</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.080" end="01:22:58.560" style="s2">right so for instance uh elephants see</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.719" end="01:23:01.280" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.560" end="01:23:02.320" style="s2">produce new images so you uh they can</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.280" end="01:23:04.239" style="s2">learn to draw</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.320" end="01:23:06.320" style="s2">and what they will apparently do is at</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.239" end="01:23:07.199" style="s2">least on in the instances that i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.320" end="01:23:09.360" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.199" end="01:23:12.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t generalize they don&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.360" end="01:23:14.400" style="s2">portrait they don&#39;t capture a new scene</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.000" end="01:23:15.679" style="s2">they will produce the same image stroke</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.400" end="01:23:18.159" style="s2">by stroke again</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.679" end="01:23:20.000" style="s2">and again they can learn to do this they</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.159" end="01:23:22.960" style="s2">have extremely good motor control</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:24.880" style="s2">but there is no obvious generalization</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.960" end="01:23:27.199" style="s2">and observation going into the</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.880" end="01:23:29.280" style="s2">thing that they draw it&#39;s not a symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.199" end="01:23:32.080" style="s2">depiction the same way as we do it</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.280" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">and if you look at the gorillas that</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.080" end="01:23:35.199" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:37.280" style="s2">raised in environments that they were</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.199" end="01:23:39.600" style="s2">exposed to human-like stimuli and</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.280" end="01:23:42.800" style="s2">human-like familial structures and so on</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.600" end="01:23:44.239" style="s2">they did get in many ways to be more</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.800" end="01:23:47.199" style="s2">similar to humans</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.239" end="01:23:48.800" style="s2">than many people thought possible but</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.199" end="01:23:50.400" style="s2">they also didn&#39;t do the grammatical</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.800" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">decomposition so when</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.400" end="01:23:54.560" style="s2">coco draws a dog it looks like uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.880" end="01:23:56.320" style="s2">jackson pollock it&#39;s basically an</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.560" end="01:23:57.040" style="s2">arrangement of colors that seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.320" end="01:23:58.960" style="s2">related</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.040" end="01:24:00.719" style="s2">to what she was looking at but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.960" end="01:24:01.199" style="s2">see the decomposition of the dog into</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.719" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">limbs</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.199" end="01:24:05.440" style="s2">and a torso and a head and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.760" end="01:24:07.520" style="s2">arrangement of the parts in it this has</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.440" end="01:24:09.360" style="s2">not been properly reproduced</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.520" end="01:24:10.880" style="s2">it&#39;s tempting to think that the lack of</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.360" end="01:24:14.560" style="s2">a chromatic decomposition</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.880" end="01:24:16.560" style="s2">in visual scenes corresponds to the lack</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.560" end="01:24:18.880" style="s2">of the ability of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.560" end="01:24:20.800" style="s2">gorilla or the tendency to use</p>

<p begin="01:24:20.800" end="01:24:24.320" style="s2">and it may be the grammatical language</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.480" end="01:24:24.719" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a compression right if</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.320" end="01:24:26.400" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.719" end="01:24:28.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have symbols we don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="01:24:32.480" end="01:24:36.000" style="s2">which is at least one argument about</p>

<p begin="01:25:00.400" end="01:25:04.159" style="s2">as an interesting question also if there</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:06.080" style="s2">is a continuum between human</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.159" end="01:25:08.239" style="s2">intelligence and ape intelligence rather</p>

<p begin="01:25:11.360" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s a big big gulf right as you</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.000" end="01:25:17.199" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.400" end="01:25:18.880" style="s2">you can teach coco to put together very</p>

<p begin="01:25:18.880" end="01:25:22.800" style="s2">but nothing at all like a recursive</p>

<p begin="01:25:22.800" end="01:25:27.520" style="s2">yes but of course there are human beings</p>

<p begin="01:25:27.520" end="01:25:32.400" style="s2">that have a similar cognitive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.880" end="01:25:34.000" style="s2">right so there are certain syndromes</p>

<p begin="01:25:37.040" end="01:25:41.199" style="s2">and the question is what exactly are the</p>

<p begin="01:25:41.199" end="01:25:44.400" style="s2">course there are</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.920" end="01:25:45.520" style="s2">in some sense because our genetic code</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.400" end="01:25:47.360" style="s2">is the same</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.520" end="01:25:49.360" style="s2">for the most part and they&#39;re just local</p>

<p begin="01:25:54.000" end="01:25:59.120" style="s2">that we are normally evolved to and yet</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.360" end="01:26:01.199" style="s2">if you look at the differences also</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.120" end="01:26:04.239" style="s2">between human beings i noticed this as</p>

<p begin="01:26:15.040" end="01:26:20.400" style="s2">are confronting them with certain ideas</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.159" end="01:26:22.000" style="s2">and there is basically a hierarchy of</p>

<p begin="01:26:22.000" end="01:26:25.199" style="s2">see in computer science say from</p>

<p begin="01:26:29.679" end="01:26:33.600" style="s2">each of these concepts basically</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.520" end="01:26:34.639" style="s2">requires more and more inversion and</p>

<p begin="01:26:34.639" end="01:26:38.480" style="s2">more and more pointers that you need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.159" end="01:26:41.040" style="s2">keep stable in the same representation</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.480" end="01:26:43.920" style="s2">the more abstract these concepts become</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.040" end="01:26:45.760" style="s2">the harder it is to teach them</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.920" end="01:26:48.880" style="s2">yep that is very true i found that same</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.760" end="01:26:50.880" style="s2">thing in my technology career i hired</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.880" end="01:26:52.480" style="s2">oh i don&#39;t know a thousand software</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.880" end="01:26:54.320" style="s2">developers perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.480" end="01:26:56.400" style="s2">and i got to be very very good at it</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.320" end="01:26:58.800" style="s2">right you know i&#39;m a pretty damn good</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.400" end="01:27:00.560" style="s2">programmer but i know many better ones</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.800" end="01:27:02.159" style="s2">but i do have probably a better</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.560" end="01:27:04.960" style="s2">theoretical basis</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.159" end="01:27:06.560" style="s2">in computer science than most but i was</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.960" end="01:27:08.960" style="s2">able to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.560" end="01:27:10.880" style="s2">at a very high level by asking</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.960" end="01:27:12.800" style="s2">relatively few questions</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.880" end="01:27:15.199" style="s2">where they stood on this hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.800" end="01:27:17.679" style="s2">understanding and the ability to grasp</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.199" end="01:27:19.280" style="s2">increasingly abstract software</p>

<p begin="01:27:19.280" end="01:27:23.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re absolutely right an hour</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.040" end="01:27:25.679" style="s2">conversation i could predict at about</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.440" end="01:27:28.080" style="s2">80 or 90 percent level of confidence how</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.679" end="01:27:29.840" style="s2">far this person would go in their career</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.080" end="01:27:31.679" style="s2">and there&#39;s this thing that most of</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.840" end="01:27:32.000" style="s2">these concepts can be taught it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.679" end="01:27:34.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.000" end="01:27:35.920" style="s2">uh the amount of time that it takes to</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.800" end="01:27:38.960" style="s2">teach the concept</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.920" end="01:27:41.360" style="s2">is very variable yep yep</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.960" end="01:27:42.400" style="s2">and realistically you only have a budget</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.360" end="01:27:44.560" style="s2">of education</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.400" end="01:27:46.080" style="s2">period right you have and realistically</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.560" end="01:27:49.600" style="s2">the individual also has</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.080" end="01:27:52.639" style="s2">a few decades right so uh if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.600" end="01:27:53.199" style="s2">are able to just learn five percent</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.639" end="01:27:55.280" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.199" end="01:27:56.560" style="s2">than somebody else this is going to</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.280" end="01:27:58.400" style="s2">compound</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.560" end="01:28:00.560" style="s2">and so i&#39;m totally envious when you look</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.400" end="01:28:01.600" style="s2">at stephen warfram who understood things</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.560" end="01:28:04.719" style="s2">at 22</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.600" end="01:28:05.120" style="s2">that i understood in my 40s yep i</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.719" end="01:28:06.960" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.120" end="01:28:08.719" style="s2">saw that my dealings with the people of</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.960" end="01:28:10.000" style="s2">the santa fe institute you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.719" end="01:28:11.840" style="s2">business world i was</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.000" end="01:28:14.080" style="s2">almost always the smartest guy in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.840" end="01:28:16.239" style="s2">room at the santa fe institute i am</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.080" end="01:28:17.920" style="s2">almost always the dumbest guy in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.239" end="01:28:20.560" style="s2">room or damn close right</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.920" end="01:28:22.639" style="s2">yeah these are great rooms yeah those</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.560" end="01:28:24.639" style="s2">are great rooms you know as i said</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.639" end="01:28:26.719" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite true but in business i</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.639" end="01:28:29.360" style="s2">was definitely in a 99th percentile</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.719" end="01:28:32.000" style="s2">in the world of complexity science on a</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.360" end="01:28:33.920" style="s2">good day i&#39;d be the 25th percentile</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.000" end="01:28:35.920" style="s2">and that is it is you know you learn so</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.920" end="01:28:37.600" style="s2">much so fast but you also</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.920" end="01:28:39.520" style="s2">come to appreciate that there are people</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.600" end="01:28:41.199" style="s2">who just operate at a very different</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.520" end="01:28:42.159" style="s2">level of abstraction than which i will</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.199" end="01:28:44.320" style="s2">never be capable</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.159" end="01:28:45.920" style="s2">of but that&#39;s okay yeah these people</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.320" end="01:28:47.760" style="s2">make me very happy</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.920" end="01:28:49.360" style="s2">i&#39;m glad they exist i like them a lot</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.760" end="01:28:51.440" style="s2">and frankly i&#39;ve spent fair amount of my</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.360" end="01:28:53.440" style="s2">effort making their life better right</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.440" end="01:28:55.120" style="s2">so they can do their work let&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.440" end="01:28:56.960" style="s2">switch a little bit let&#39;s get a little</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.120" end="01:28:58.960" style="s2">move down some in the stack of</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.960" end="01:29:01.040" style="s2">abstraction you know in</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.960" end="01:29:02.800" style="s2">your writings particularly in the book</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.040" end="01:29:05.520" style="s2">you talk a fair amount about</p>

<p begin="01:29:06.080" end="01:29:09.920" style="s2">we talked about the very beginning</p>

<p begin="01:29:14.159" end="01:29:17.520" style="s2">maybe do practical things but at least</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.760" end="01:29:19.520" style="s2">understand ourselves better could you</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.520" end="01:29:20.400" style="s2">maybe tell for our audience a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.520" end="01:29:22.480" style="s2">about what</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.400" end="01:29:24.639" style="s2">cognitive architectures are in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.480" end="01:29:27.760" style="s2">you know things like soar akdar</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.639" end="01:29:30.000" style="s2">and the sci model and how they differ</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.760" end="01:29:31.520" style="s2">from what we read about in the newspaper</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.000" end="01:29:32.239" style="s2">all the time you know the machine</p>

<p begin="01:29:35.679" end="01:29:41.120" style="s2">architectures are a tradition that</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.679" end="01:29:43.120" style="s2">mostly originated in psychology within</p>

<p begin="01:29:45.600" end="01:29:51.199" style="s2">and then decided to get real about this</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.800" end="01:29:52.639" style="s2">and try to get a look at the way our</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.199" end="01:29:54.560" style="s2">mind is structured because our mind</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.639" end="01:29:57.199" style="s2">obviously has a lot of structure</p>

<p begin="01:29:57.199" end="01:29:59.360" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.760" end="01:30:01.120" style="s2">identify the principles that would need</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.360" end="01:30:03.360" style="s2">to be implemented</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.120" end="01:30:04.560" style="s2">and i think that most people in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.360" end="01:30:07.280" style="s2">field of ai</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.560" end="01:30:08.560" style="s2">would agree that there are two</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.280" end="01:30:10.800" style="s2">directions that we need</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.560" end="01:30:12.320" style="s2">to look into one is the general</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.800" end="01:30:13.520" style="s2">principles of learning and functional</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.320" end="01:30:16.320" style="s2">approximation so</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.520" end="01:30:18.080" style="s2">when confronted with data how do you</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.320" end="01:30:20.400" style="s2">efficiently build a model</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.080" end="01:30:22.480" style="s2">over the data that allows you to predict</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.400" end="01:30:24.639" style="s2">future data and interact with it and</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.480" end="01:30:25.679" style="s2">build control models and the other</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.639" end="01:30:27.360" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.679" end="01:30:29.520" style="s2">in which particular way is this</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.360" end="01:30:31.280" style="s2">organized in the human mind to give rise</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.520" end="01:30:33.520" style="s2">to the particular feats</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.280" end="01:30:35.360" style="s2">that humans have like learning language</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.520" end="01:30:37.520" style="s2">interacting socially interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.360" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">the environment and with their bodies</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.520" end="01:30:40.880" style="s2">to reflect symbolically over their</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:43.360" style="s2">perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.880" end="01:30:44.480" style="s2">uh representations such as feelings and</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.360" end="01:30:46.800" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.480" end="01:30:47.679" style="s2">so to how to get these two perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.800" end="01:30:50.000" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.679" end="01:30:51.600" style="s2">is is for me a very interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.000" end="01:30:53.520" style="s2">challenging question</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.600" end="01:30:55.120" style="s2">and most of the work that is being done</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.520" end="01:30:57.280" style="s2">in machine learning is not looking at</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.120" end="01:30:59.120" style="s2">architectures the architecture is</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.280" end="01:31:00.480" style="s2">only instrumental to a certain task</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.120" end="01:31:03.840" style="s2">which could be for instance</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.480" end="01:31:06.080" style="s2">text completion so we think about how to</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.840" end="01:31:07.679" style="s2">organize structure into layers and then</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.080" end="01:31:09.440" style="s2">how to stack the right number of layers</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.679" end="01:31:10.880" style="s2">together or maybe implement an algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.440" end="01:31:12.400" style="s2">that automatically searches for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.880" end="01:31:14.080" style="s2">right number of layers</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.400" end="01:31:16.000" style="s2">but we can also see that the brain is</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.080" end="01:31:17.920" style="s2">not organized into layers</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.000" end="01:31:19.960" style="s2">it&#39;s organized into regions that have</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.920" end="01:31:22.080" style="s2">very complex</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.960" end="01:31:22.960" style="s2">interconnectivity right so it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.080" end="01:31:26.000" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.960" end="01:31:28.400" style="s2">uh like a city with a rich set of</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.000" end="01:31:30.560" style="s2">different uh ways of transporting</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.400" end="01:31:32.400" style="s2">information around in it right so there</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.560" end="01:31:34.480" style="s2">is going to be some</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.400" end="01:31:35.760" style="s2">street network that is low level where</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.480" end="01:31:36.719" style="s2">you can reach your immediate</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.760" end="01:31:38.880" style="s2">neighborhood</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.719" end="01:31:40.639" style="s2">and then but it&#39;s quite pedestrian and</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.880" end="01:31:42.800" style="s2">it takes longer for the signals to cross</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.639" end="01:31:45.440" style="s2">large distances and then there are</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.800" end="01:31:46.800" style="s2">long-range connections like a subway and</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.440" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">then there is some</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.800" end="01:31:50.480" style="s2">general interconnection network that</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:52.639" style="s2">goes by the thalamus and allows to</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.480" end="01:31:54.400" style="s2">for information from basically all every</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.639" end="01:31:55.600" style="s2">region in the neocortex to get to every</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.400" end="01:31:58.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.600" end="01:32:00.239" style="s2">to route information around and so how</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.480" end="01:32:01.600" style="s2">how that works is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.239" end="01:32:03.520" style="s2">question to me</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.600" end="01:32:04.639" style="s2">you could also look from the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.520" end="01:32:07.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.639" end="01:32:08.080" style="s2">training a network in some layer by</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.280" end="01:32:10.639" style="s2">layer and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.080" end="01:32:12.639" style="s2">as soon as you introduce a new layer you</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.639" end="01:32:13.520" style="s2">make this a function of the existing</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.639" end="01:32:14.960" style="s2">layers</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.520" end="01:32:16.639" style="s2">and once that thing is trained you</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.960" end="01:32:18.320" style="s2">introduce recurrent links so the</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.639" end="01:32:19.360" style="s2">predictions of a later layer in your</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.320" end="01:32:21.040" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.360" end="01:32:22.960" style="s2">are going to inform the predictions of</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.040" end="01:32:23.280" style="s2">the earlier layers and become inputs to</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.960" end="01:32:24.719" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.280" end="01:32:26.480" style="s2">right so they become the context in</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.719" end="01:32:27.520" style="s2">which the lower layer makes its next</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.480" end="01:32:30.000" style="s2">prediction</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.520" end="01:32:30.719" style="s2">and the result is the same so instead of</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.000" end="01:32:32.960" style="s2">getting a</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.719" end="01:32:35.120" style="s2">nicely titty hierarchy of things where</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.960" end="01:32:36.960" style="s2">you have an input and an output and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.120" end="01:32:38.639" style="s2">input is your sensible apparatus and</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.960" end="01:32:41.199" style="s2">your output is the</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.639" end="01:32:43.440" style="s2">highest layer of your attention it turns</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.199" end="01:32:45.280" style="s2">out to be fully interconnected and going</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.440" end="01:32:47.040" style="s2">everywhere backwards and forwards</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.280" end="01:32:48.639" style="s2">and suddenly your visual cortex is not</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.040" end="01:32:50.239" style="s2">the first stage of processing</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.639" end="01:32:52.239" style="s2">it&#39;s just the area where you store the</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.239" end="01:32:53.360" style="s2">saw the textures</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.239" end="01:32:55.440" style="s2">and of course that seems to be how the</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.360" end="01:32:57.920" style="s2">human mind is structured and you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.440" end="01:32:59.360" style="s2">when i react to deep learning mostly</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.920" end="01:33:01.840" style="s2">feed forward though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.360" end="01:33:03.520" style="s2">now adding some simple recursion i i</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.840" end="01:33:06.639" style="s2">always ask myself what are they missing</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.520" end="01:33:08.719" style="s2">by not having these feedback loops</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.639" end="01:33:10.400" style="s2">i think that everybody is aware of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.719" end="01:33:11.440" style="s2">fact that they want to have recurrences</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.400" end="01:33:13.199" style="s2">right from the start</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.440" end="01:33:15.760" style="s2">when you look at the original work for</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.199" end="01:33:16.639" style="s2">instance by hinton and zanovsky and</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:18.880" style="s2">declay on</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.639" end="01:33:20.960" style="s2">boltzmann machines that you have already</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.880" end="01:33:23.199" style="s2">a very very general form of a model that</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.960" end="01:33:25.120" style="s2">understands that a model is a set of</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.199" end="01:33:26.960" style="s2">parameters that constrain each other and</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.120" end="01:33:27.920" style="s2">each constraint is a computable function</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.960" end="01:33:30.719" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.920" end="01:33:32.239" style="s2">if a parameter has this value the</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.719" end="01:33:33.840" style="s2">influence that has on all the other</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.239" end="01:33:35.600" style="s2">parameters in the model</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.840" end="01:33:37.760" style="s2">and then you can say that the deviation</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.600" end="01:33:39.600" style="s2">from these constraints is energy</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.760" end="01:33:41.440" style="s2">and you minimize the energy so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.600" end="01:33:42.639" style="s2">similar to a spin last model in physics</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.440" end="01:33:44.560" style="s2">where you try to</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.639" end="01:33:46.239" style="s2">minimize the global energy state of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.560" end="01:33:47.600" style="s2">system and when you achieve that</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.239" end="01:33:49.520" style="s2">the system converges to an</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.600" end="01:33:51.120" style="s2">interpretation of reality</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.520" end="01:33:52.880" style="s2">and in some sense theoretically this</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.120" end="01:33:54.960" style="s2">works very well as a model it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.880" end="01:33:57.440" style="s2">pretty close to optimal but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.960" end="01:34:00.400" style="s2">impossible to train it turns out because</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.440" end="01:34:01.840" style="s2">the search space for these variables and</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.400" end="01:34:04.480" style="s2">constraints between them is</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.840" end="01:34:05.840" style="s2">so dramatically large it&#39;s basically not</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.480" end="01:34:09.520" style="s2">trainable beyond a few</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.840" end="01:34:11.520" style="s2">parameters and so um hinton introduced a</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.520" end="01:34:13.120" style="s2">constraint on this he said that</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.520" end="01:34:14.960" style="s2">instead of having all these natural</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.120" end="01:34:16.000" style="s2">links between the parameters all these</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.960" end="01:34:19.360" style="s2">hidden links</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.000" end="01:34:21.040" style="s2">we only link them in a forward manner</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.360" end="01:34:22.639" style="s2">and in between the parameters we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.040" end="01:34:24.960" style="s2">have links and what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.639" end="01:34:27.520" style="s2">restricted boltzmann machine rbm</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.960" end="01:34:29.280" style="s2">and of course suddenly this thing cannot</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.520" end="01:34:31.199" style="s2">model many things anymore and</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.280" end="01:34:33.679" style="s2">the solution to that was to string many</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.199" end="01:34:35.440" style="s2">of these rbms together in a network</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.679" end="01:34:37.679" style="s2">so each of them is individually</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.440" end="01:34:40.480" style="s2">trainable even though it&#39;s limited</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.679" end="01:34:42.239" style="s2">and overall it produces a behavior that</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.480" end="01:34:44.320" style="s2">the individuals could not</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.239" end="01:34:46.080" style="s2">and this eventually leads to our current</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.320" end="01:34:46.800" style="s2">deep learning architectures by a few</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.080" end="01:34:48.480" style="s2">steps</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.800" end="01:34:49.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s not optimal right the search</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.480" end="01:34:51.520" style="s2">space is too large</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.840" end="01:34:53.119" style="s2">the too many model states the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.520" end="01:34:55.840" style="s2">model should be able</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.119" end="01:34:56.800" style="s2">to be so tight that every model states</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.840" end="01:34:59.360" style="s2">corresponds to a</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.800" end="01:35:00.159" style="s2">possible state and reality most neural</p>

<p begin="01:35:00.159" end="01:35:04.560" style="s2">have many magnitudes more possible model</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.400" end="01:35:06.000" style="s2">states which gives rise to adversarial</p>

<p begin="01:35:14.159" end="01:35:19.920" style="s2">so uh for me the uh thing that a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:35:23.920" end="01:35:28.719" style="s2">it seems to be a way to think about</p>

<p begin="01:35:28.719" end="01:35:32.960" style="s2">of features in a more general way so it</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.719" end="01:35:36.000" style="s2">gets back to this original notion</p>

<p begin="01:35:39.280" end="01:35:42.320" style="s2">and it is</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.400" end="01:35:44.719" style="s2">this notion of attention and</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.320" end="01:35:48.239" style="s2">self-attention binds features together</p>

<p begin="01:36:03.920" end="01:36:09.440" style="s2">just refers to this as the scientist</p>

<p begin="01:36:13.440" end="01:36:17.119" style="s2">uh entities refer to the same concept in</p>

<p begin="01:36:17.119" end="01:36:20.960" style="s2">right this is something that was very</p>

<p begin="01:36:24.560" end="01:36:27.840" style="s2">it&#39;s striking that this doesn&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.080" end="01:36:29.679" style="s2">work for text it also works for images</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.840" end="01:36:31.360" style="s2">so you can train this on images</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.679" end="01:36:32.800" style="s2">you repeated the first few lines of an</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.360" end="01:36:33.520" style="s2">image and it&#39;s going to continue the</p>

<p begin="01:36:33.520" end="01:36:37.119" style="s2">which implies that internally while</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.679" end="01:36:38.320" style="s2">predicting the image it&#39;s building a</p>

<p begin="01:36:38.320" end="01:36:41.920" style="s2">during the prediction of the next thing</p>

<p begin="01:36:41.920" end="01:36:47.040" style="s2">until the end right so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.119" end="01:36:49.840" style="s2">tremendous achievement it seems to open</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.040" end="01:36:52.480" style="s2">the door to embeddings in general</p>

<p begin="01:36:58.400" end="01:37:02.639" style="s2">is there a difference between making a</p>

<p begin="01:37:02.639" end="01:37:05.760" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the same thing just from a</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.320" end="01:37:07.199" style="s2">different perspective right</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.760" end="01:37:09.280" style="s2">there is still going to be some</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.199" end="01:37:11.280" style="s2">differences in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.280" end="01:37:13.520" style="s2">the way we predict reality because we do</p>

<p begin="01:37:13.520" end="01:37:17.360" style="s2">we also predict reality from the</p>

<p begin="01:37:17.360" end="01:37:22.639" style="s2">to have so we limit our search space</p>

<p begin="01:37:22.639" end="01:37:27.199" style="s2">achieved in the end</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.719" end="01:37:27.760" style="s2">and this is a thing that the way we</p>

<p begin="01:37:27.760" end="01:37:32.000" style="s2">the gpt-2 class or transformer class of</p>

<p begin="01:37:38.480" end="01:37:42.400" style="s2">that&#39;s very very interesting about where</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.800" end="01:37:44.719" style="s2">we may be able to go</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.400" end="01:37:45.760" style="s2">in using transformer based architectures</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.719" end="01:37:47.119" style="s2">to get back to</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.760" end="01:37:49.679" style="s2">you know the ability to do things at</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.119" end="01:37:51.199" style="s2">long range and you know the transformer</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.679" end="01:37:52.400" style="s2">architecture is still a heck if you look</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.199" end="01:37:55.119" style="s2">at it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.400" end="01:37:57.040" style="s2">very simple idea of course a very smart</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.119" end="01:37:58.719" style="s2">simple idea that is then scaled up to</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.040" end="01:38:01.280" style="s2">see how far it can go there&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.719" end="01:38:02.800" style="s2">obvious limit but that we have hit yet</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.280" end="01:38:05.360" style="s2">to how far it can go which is</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.800" end="01:38:06.320" style="s2">in some sense terrifying because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.360" end="01:38:09.520" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.320" end="01:38:10.480" style="s2">and uh you immediately wonder uh what</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.520" end="01:38:13.119" style="s2">are the</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.480" end="01:38:13.600" style="s2">uh optimizations going to be that we</p>

<p begin="01:38:13.600" end="01:38:17.199" style="s2">quite inevitably discover in the next</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.360" end="01:38:18.400" style="s2">few years yep that&#39;d be very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.199" end="01:38:18.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll have to keep a look on it we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:38:18.800" end="01:38:23.119" style="s2">long on time here kind of gone over our</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.280" end="01:38:24.880" style="s2">time limit but that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.119" end="01:38:27.280" style="s2">i&#39;d like to drill down a little further</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.880" end="01:38:29.040" style="s2">into details into some of your own work</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.280" end="01:38:30.560" style="s2">now let&#39;s maybe give it another 10</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.040" end="01:38:33.119" style="s2">minutes if we can</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.560" end="01:38:33.679" style="s2">and talk a little bit about the psy</p>

<p begin="01:38:40.080" end="01:38:44.159" style="s2">on the topic and one thing i found</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.320" end="01:38:45.600" style="s2">interesting about it was that it was</p>

<p begin="01:38:45.600" end="01:38:49.840" style="s2">but the elements in the connection</p>

<p begin="01:38:50.960" end="01:38:55.199" style="s2">could be at varying levels of</p>

<p begin="01:38:55.199" end="01:38:59.199" style="s2">and you know the system self-organized</p>

<p begin="01:38:59.199" end="01:39:02.480" style="s2">anyway if you could</p>

<p begin="01:40:23.440" end="01:40:28.880" style="s2">in parallel many of the ideas that ai</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.920" end="01:40:30.560" style="s2">was into so he started out with</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.880" end="01:40:32.639" style="s2">monolithic systems</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.560" end="01:40:34.480" style="s2">that later became situated connected to</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.639" end="01:40:34.960" style="s2">environment and then this environment</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.480" end="01:40:36.960" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.960" end="01:40:38.239" style="s2">changed by the system so it became an</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.960" end="01:40:39.920" style="s2">agent architecture</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.239" end="01:40:41.679" style="s2">and then he invented multi-agent</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.920" end="01:40:43.679" style="s2">architectures and</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.679" end="01:40:45.840" style="s2">all the while these architectures had</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.679" end="01:40:47.119" style="s2">models of autonomous motivation in them</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.840" end="01:40:49.520" style="s2">that were</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.119" end="01:40:52.400" style="s2">based on this cybernetic idea of a</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.520" end="01:40:55.520" style="s2">feedback loop that would regulate it all</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.400" end="01:40:57.600" style="s2">and what i liked about his work was</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.520" end="01:40:58.960" style="s2">that he was extremely serious about</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.600" end="01:41:00.639" style="s2">building minds and</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.960" end="01:41:02.320" style="s2">his heart seemed to be in the right spot</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.639" end="01:41:03.199" style="s2">and also his ideas seem to be on the</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.320" end="01:41:05.119" style="s2">right spot so</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.199" end="01:41:06.480" style="s2">when there started reading his ideas in</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.119" end="01:41:08.719" style="s2">the 1980s</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.480" end="01:41:10.480" style="s2">uh most of the psychologists ignored him</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.719" end="01:41:12.639" style="s2">because uh there was</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.480" end="01:41:14.080" style="s2">theoretical psychology he uh for a long</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.639" end="01:41:16.000" style="s2">time had the only chair</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.080" end="01:41:17.520" style="s2">of theoretical psychology in germany</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.000" end="01:41:18.719" style="s2">there was no such thing as theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.520" end="01:41:20.880" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.719" end="01:41:23.360" style="s2">and uh that basically tried to bridge</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.880" end="01:41:25.119" style="s2">between ai ideas and psychology while he</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.360" end="01:41:27.280" style="s2">was mostly unaware</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.119" end="01:41:28.400" style="s2">of the discourse that would take place</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.280" end="01:41:30.639" style="s2">in ai and</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.400" end="01:41:33.040" style="s2">uh you would read sometimes something</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.639" end="01:41:34.400" style="s2">about it but always come up with his own</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.040" end="01:41:36.880" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.400" end="01:41:37.679" style="s2">the first interview that i read with him</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.880" end="01:41:39.760" style="s2">a very</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.679" end="01:41:42.000" style="s2">consternated journalist of the german</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.760" end="01:41:43.280" style="s2">magazine spiegel which is the equivalent</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.000" end="01:41:47.199" style="s2">of the times</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.280" end="01:41:48.480" style="s2">uh in us asked him why he would claim</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.199" end="01:41:50.800" style="s2">that these systems are</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.480" end="01:41:51.920" style="s2">have two emotions it would be wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.800" end="01:41:53.280" style="s2">everybody understand that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.920" end="01:41:54.320" style="s2">impossible for a computer to have</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.280" end="01:41:56.560" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.320" end="01:41:58.880" style="s2">and turner replied very earnestly that</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.560" end="01:42:00.639" style="s2">it really depends on your definition of</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.880" end="01:42:02.560" style="s2">emotion and that if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.639" end="01:42:04.159" style="s2">definition of emotion that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.560" end="01:42:05.360" style="s2">an extension that you can understand you</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.159" end="01:42:06.159" style="s2">probably don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.360" end="01:42:08.239" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.159" end="01:42:10.639" style="s2">and then he went on to try to define</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.239" end="01:42:12.880" style="s2">emotion and then ex try to explain</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.639" end="01:42:14.000" style="s2">why his systems would have emotion in</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.880" end="01:42:16.400" style="s2">this sense</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.000" end="01:42:18.159" style="s2">and i i agreed with them and uh while i</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.400" end="01:42:19.600" style="s2">thought that this notion of emotion does</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.159" end="01:42:21.600" style="s2">not capture everything</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.600" end="01:42:22.719" style="s2">that emotion captures for me when i</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.600" end="01:42:24.800" style="s2">define emotion</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.719" end="01:42:26.960" style="s2">uh it seemed to me that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.800" end="01:42:29.119" style="s2">trajectory along which we can make this</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.960" end="01:42:31.040" style="s2">definition richer and extend it and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.119" end="01:42:33.520" style="s2">implement all these missing things</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.040" end="01:42:34.719" style="s2">until we all agree so i i thought this</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.520" end="01:42:37.440" style="s2">is probably the way to go</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.719" end="01:42:38.080" style="s2">and i started reading all this stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.440" end="01:42:40.320" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.080" end="01:42:41.679" style="s2">decided to systematize it and translate</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.320" end="01:42:42.719" style="s2">into something that could be actually</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.679" end="01:42:44.320" style="s2">implemented and</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.719" end="01:42:46.159" style="s2">because there was less bold than him i</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.320" end="01:42:46.560" style="s2">took his science theory style this</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.159" end="01:42:48.400" style="s2">letter</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.560" end="01:42:50.400" style="s2">that psychologists love to use and they</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.400" end="01:42:53.040" style="s2">make a theory of everything</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.400" end="01:42:54.639" style="s2">and translate it into mycocy my humble</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.040" end="01:42:56.880" style="s2">attempt as a computer scientist to get</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.639" end="01:43:00.000" style="s2">some of the concepts at least to work</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.880" end="01:43:00.800" style="s2">and i spent uh almost a decade with that</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.000" end="01:43:02.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.800" end="01:43:04.719" style="s2">this uh book principles of synthetic</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.880" end="01:43:07.280" style="s2">intelligence is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.719" end="01:43:08.480" style="s2">turn the site into an acronym for a book</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.280" end="01:43:11.600" style="s2">title of course</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.480" end="01:43:13.360" style="s2">and uh to systematize his work and make</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.600" end="01:43:13.920" style="s2">it accessible to people in cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.360" end="01:43:16.400" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.920" end="01:43:17.520" style="s2">and artificial intelligence so this is</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.400" end="01:43:19.520" style="s2">what the first</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.520" end="01:43:20.719" style="s2">third of the book is doing summarize</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.520" end="01:43:22.639" style="s2">donors ideas</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.719" end="01:43:24.320" style="s2">and systematize them contrast them with</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.639" end="01:43:27.520" style="s2">ideas that were around in the field</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.320" end="01:43:30.000" style="s2">compared to related work and then</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.520" end="01:43:31.840" style="s2">the second part of the book is</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.000" end="01:43:32.960" style="s2">implementing these ideas and the third</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.840" end="01:43:35.280" style="s2">part of the book is</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.960" end="01:43:37.280" style="s2">critiquing them and explaining where i</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.280" end="01:43:38.960" style="s2">think we need to go beyond them</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.280" end="01:43:40.719" style="s2">and this is a snapshot of my</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.960" end="01:43:44.000" style="s2">understanding back then and my</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.719" end="01:43:46.719" style="s2">thinking has since then in many areas</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.000" end="01:43:47.679" style="s2">evolved a great deal and moved on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.719" end="01:43:49.360" style="s2">not that i</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.679" end="01:43:51.280" style="s2">still think that these now think that</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.360" end="01:43:53.600" style="s2">these are bad ideas it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.280" end="01:43:55.199" style="s2">this would be the first third of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.600" end="01:43:56.800" style="s2">next book that i would write if i find</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.199" end="01:43:59.360" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.800" end="01:44:01.280" style="s2">okay interesting and what is the status</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.360" end="01:44:01.679" style="s2">of the micro sci project i saw there was</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.280" end="01:44:04.719" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.679" end="01:44:06.560" style="s2">micro sci 1 which ran only under windows</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.719" end="01:44:08.239" style="s2">and then there was a microsite 2 that</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.560" end="01:44:10.320" style="s2">was written in python</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.239" end="01:44:11.520" style="s2">but i looked at the github project</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.320" end="01:44:13.440" style="s2">looked like there hadn&#39;t been any</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.520" end="01:44:14.960" style="s2">updates on it four or five years</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.440" end="01:44:16.719" style="s2">is anybody working on it is it being</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.960" end="01:44:19.040" style="s2">used at this point</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.719" end="01:44:20.960" style="s2">yes so the the first microsoft we always</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.040" end="01:44:21.280" style="s2">try to be platform independent because</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.960" end="01:44:23.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.280" end="01:44:24.960" style="s2">people that i worked with they had macs</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.119" end="01:44:27.119" style="s2">they had linux they had windows</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.960" end="01:44:29.520" style="s2">and we wanted to make this accessible to</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.119" end="01:44:32.159" style="s2">anyone so the first one was done in java</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.520" end="01:44:35.119" style="s2">and was written directly as plugin to</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.159" end="01:44:36.560" style="s2">the eclipse ide and it was using all the</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.119" end="01:44:38.639" style="s2">typical things that you would use in</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.560" end="01:44:41.440" style="s2">2003 so lots of xml</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.639" end="01:44:42.159" style="s2">and lots of factories and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.440" end="01:44:44.000" style="s2">back then</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.159" end="01:44:45.600" style="s2">it was respectable software engineering</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.000" end="01:44:47.040" style="s2">but it was very different from what we</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.600" end="01:44:48.800" style="s2">would do five years later when</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.040" end="01:44:52.159" style="s2">everything was going to be pyson</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.800" end="01:44:54.239" style="s2">and you would put your ui in the browser</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.159" end="01:44:56.080" style="s2">so uh the way to make platform</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.239" end="01:44:57.360" style="s2">independent implementation of a research</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.080" end="01:44:58.960" style="s2">cognitive architecture</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.360" end="01:45:01.199" style="s2">was different when you did the second</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.960" end="01:45:03.600" style="s2">edition and the second edition</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.199" end="01:45:04.719" style="s2">was being used in two startups one went</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.600" end="01:45:07.679" style="s2">defunct</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.719" end="01:45:08.560" style="s2">i was in uh ai planning startup the</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.679" end="01:45:10.400" style="s2">other one</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.560" end="01:45:12.639" style="s2">was started later by students of mine</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.400" end="01:45:14.719" style="s2">mostly i&#39;m also a co-founder in this</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.639" end="01:45:17.600" style="s2">it&#39;s called microsoft industries and</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.719" end="01:45:20.000" style="s2">uses the microscope architecture</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.600" end="01:45:20.960" style="s2">as a framework to implement control</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.000" end="01:45:24.000" style="s2">networks for</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.960" end="01:45:25.760" style="s2">industrial robots mostly and</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.000" end="01:45:28.080" style="s2">also does a little bit of basic research</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.760" end="01:45:29.760" style="s2">but most of the things that are done are</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.080" end="01:45:31.840" style="s2">in-house so while we still</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.760" end="01:45:33.600" style="s2">post the architecture for people that</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.840" end="01:45:34.880" style="s2">want to use it and some people use it</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.600" end="01:45:36.719" style="s2">and play around with it</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.880" end="01:45:39.280" style="s2">the main evolution takes place within</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.719" end="01:45:40.639" style="s2">the company for proprietary projects in</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.280" end="01:45:43.679" style="s2">britain</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.639" end="01:45:46.719" style="s2">and at the moment i am using</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.679" end="01:45:48.800" style="s2">microsci internally for trying out</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.719" end="01:45:50.960" style="s2">a certain models that i have about using</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.800" end="01:45:53.760" style="s2">spreading activation networks to</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.960" end="01:45:55.600" style="s2">produce procedural strips that interact</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.760" end="01:45:57.600" style="s2">with cellular automata</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.600" end="01:45:58.800" style="s2">representation and processing layers</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.600" end="01:46:00.800" style="s2">also thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.800" end="01:46:02.480" style="s2">uh what the next edition of microsite is</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.800" end="01:46:04.320" style="s2">going to be and how it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.480" end="01:46:05.920" style="s2">implemented and we have some ideas about</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.320" end="01:46:07.119" style="s2">this but it&#39;s too early to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.920" end="01:46:09.280" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.119" end="01:46:11.360" style="s2">ah okay i was going to see if i could</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.280" end="01:46:12.960" style="s2">get you to talk about what microsoft 3</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.360" end="01:46:14.719" style="s2">might be looking like</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.960" end="01:46:16.880" style="s2">i&#39;m going to throw out some ideas which</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.719" end="01:46:19.679" style="s2">i&#39;ve also i&#39;m always throwing at</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.880" end="01:46:21.520" style="s2">ben gertzel about opencog which is i</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.679" end="01:46:23.760" style="s2">hope when you do it that you think</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.520" end="01:46:25.199" style="s2">big so many of these cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.760" end="01:46:27.679" style="s2">architectures or</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.199" end="01:46:29.360" style="s2">ai platforms were unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.679" end="01:46:32.159" style="s2">conceptualized to only run</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.360" end="01:46:32.719" style="s2">on a single machine or a small cluster</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.159" end="01:46:34.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.719" end="01:46:37.440" style="s2">one of the things that we now have is</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.880" end="01:46:40.320" style="s2">really cheap computation and really fast</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.440" end="01:46:41.199" style="s2">networks and if i were designing a</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.320" end="01:46:44.159" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.199" end="01:46:46.560" style="s2">for thinking machines i would look</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.159" end="01:46:50.159" style="s2">carefully at some of the apache</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.560" end="01:46:51.040" style="s2">large scale very big cluster very large</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.159" end="01:46:53.920" style="s2">throughput</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.040" end="01:46:54.800" style="s2">platforms like ignite and flink and</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.920" end="01:46:56.560" style="s2">spark</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.800" end="01:46:58.239" style="s2">it has two big advantages one that they</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.560" end="01:47:00.480" style="s2">operate at massive scale</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.239" end="01:47:02.480" style="s2">and secondly it gets the implementer out</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.480" end="01:47:03.280" style="s2">of having to write a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.480" end="01:47:05.760" style="s2">low-level</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.280" end="01:47:06.960" style="s2">stuff and so you can leverage your</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.760" end="01:47:09.119" style="s2">manpower</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.960" end="01:47:10.800" style="s2">in the higher levels of the actual value</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.119" end="01:47:12.159" style="s2">add rather than trying to optimize how</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.800" end="01:47:13.440" style="s2">you move pointers and things of that</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.159" end="01:47:14.480" style="s2">sort these guys have already figured</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.440" end="01:47:17.520" style="s2">that out</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.480" end="01:47:19.119" style="s2">exactly i also wonder whether we should</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.520" end="01:47:22.480" style="s2">still think so much of</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.119" end="01:47:24.960" style="s2">vision system and more across systems</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.480" end="01:47:25.679" style="s2">so instead of thinking about how we can</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.960" end="01:47:27.119" style="s2">make a</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.679" end="01:47:29.360" style="s2">representation that is completely</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.119" end="01:47:30.960" style="s2">homogenous think about how different</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.360" end="01:47:32.960" style="s2">parts of the architecture</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.960" end="01:47:34.639" style="s2">implement general principles that allow</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.960" end="01:47:35.679" style="s2">them to learn how to interact with all</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.639" end="01:47:37.760" style="s2">the other parts</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.679" end="01:47:39.840" style="s2">and if that happens you can for instance</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.760" end="01:47:41.840" style="s2">instead of reinventing linear algebra</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.840" end="01:47:44.159" style="s2">on your gpu that then reinvents how to</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.840" end="01:47:44.880" style="s2">render graphics on the gpu using linear</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.159" end="01:47:47.040" style="s2">algebra</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.880" end="01:47:48.639" style="s2">you can for instance use existing shader</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.040" end="01:47:50.960" style="s2">programs and graphics engines</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.639" end="01:47:52.000" style="s2">and learn how to use them instead i</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.960" end="01:47:53.760" style="s2">think that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.000" end="01:47:55.280" style="s2">again there is no free lunch so people</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.760" end="01:47:56.000" style="s2">say oh yeah well you have ignite you</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.280" end="01:47:58.480" style="s2">know a true</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.000" end="01:48:00.480" style="s2">gigantic key value store well guess what</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.480" end="01:48:01.280" style="s2">on distributed architectures there is no</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.480" end="01:48:03.840" style="s2">free lunch</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.280" end="01:48:05.600" style="s2">right queries that have to traverse the</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.840" end="01:48:06.800" style="s2">network have very different costs than</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.600" end="01:48:08.639" style="s2">ones that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.800" end="01:48:11.199" style="s2">and so having a system that can</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.639" end="01:48:12.960" style="s2">self-organize to take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.199" end="01:48:15.119" style="s2">realities of its network</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.960" end="01:48:17.600" style="s2">is probably the real secret to maximize</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.119" end="01:48:18.239" style="s2">these super powerful gigantic scalar</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.600" end="01:48:20.000" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.239" end="01:48:22.320" style="s2">but using them naively you can produce</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.000" end="01:48:24.639" style="s2">degenerate queries quite simply that</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.320" end="01:48:26.800" style="s2">yes you have 100 000 processors but</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.639" end="01:48:28.639" style="s2">guess what it&#39;s still slow because the</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.800" end="01:48:29.679" style="s2">data is all over the place that makes</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.639" end="01:48:31.600" style="s2">any single query</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.679" end="01:48:33.440" style="s2">inefficient so these things are by no</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.600" end="01:48:34.960" style="s2">means panaceas but</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.440" end="01:48:36.800" style="s2">if i were going to go down that road i</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.960" end="01:48:37.600" style="s2">would be thinking of these very large</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.800" end="01:48:40.000" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.600" end="01:48:41.840" style="s2">data processing architectures rather</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.000" end="01:48:44.159" style="s2">than writing something to run on a</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.840" end="01:48:46.400" style="s2">single machine or a small cluster</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.159" end="01:48:47.440" style="s2">well this has been a very interesting</p>

<p begin="01:48:47.440" end="01:48:50.239" style="s2">we went a little bit longer than i was</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.800" end="01:48:52.239" style="s2">thinking we didn&#39;t get to some of the</p>
