<p begin="00:00:12.330" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">part three of you could say kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:22.650" style="s2">second version or the continuing version</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">of our conversations on attachment</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.650" end="00:00:31.080" style="s2">theory and how it relates to circling</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.789" end="00:00:34.200" style="s2">and we did a video about a year ago that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.080" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">was about an hour long and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.200" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">been doing a lot of research and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:41.820" style="s2">specifically specifically we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">using quotes and have been using quotes</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:47.600" style="s2">out of a particular book that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">going to talk more about and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:53.809" style="s2">beginning to have a dialogue between the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">experience that you&#39;ve had with me</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.809" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">through circling oh you&#39;ve really found</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">that like something that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:06.260" style="s2">circling points to a lot of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">that have been researched and documented</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.260" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">around attachment theory and that so so</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">you&#39;ve been in a certain sense you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">been standing between like a foot in</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">both worlds and been in this oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">experience you know this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">we&#39;re practicing this stuff encircling</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">and you&#39;ve had quite a fire and a fury</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">almost I would say an intellectual fury</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">to really make that connection and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve just really appreciated that about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:37.290" style="s2">you I&#39;ve just always appreciated about</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.170" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">that you know that you are permeable to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:43.880" style="s2">be infected with really brilliant ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">and want to continually explore them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.880" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">and feel moved like no one&#39;s asking you</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">to do this right you could just have</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">your practice and live your life</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:55.740" style="s2">but there&#39;s something in you that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">interested in this and wants to write</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.740" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">articles and publish them and do videos</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">with me and post them on Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">have a dialogue going on no one&#39;s asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:08.069" style="s2">you to do this this is really coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:09.770" style="s2">from someplace in your own heart and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.069" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">just want to acknowledge that in you</p>

<p begin="00:03:14.070" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">feels like we&#39;re bringing circling</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.170" end="00:03:22.770" style="s2">directly a little bit into this</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:25.770" style="s2">interview and so as you&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.770" end="00:03:27.330" style="s2">I just felt this dropping away of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.770" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">the things I want to talk about today</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.330" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">and just watching you reflect me back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:39.600" style="s2">me and just I felt this expansion</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">happening or just the settling I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.600" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">was receiving what you were saying I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">um I guess I&#39;m there aren&#39;t really words</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:52.380" style="s2">to describe what it was just happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">while I was listening to you well I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.380" end="00:03:56.540" style="s2">one of the things that I said was you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:59.580" style="s2">know I mentioned the fire that you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.540" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">there&#39;s something speaking to you that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.580" end="00:04:07.410" style="s2">you that you feel compelled to write</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:10.290" style="s2">about to get over fears and anxieties</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.410" end="00:04:11.940" style="s2">about you know being seen in the public</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.290" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2">and in front of cameras you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.940" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">some sacrificing a lot of your own</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">comfort in your own time</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:19.769" style="s2">I really am that&#39;s true I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:21.390" style="s2">starting to really look forward to these</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.769" end="00:04:23.729" style="s2">videos and I&#39;m enjoying them but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.390" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">you know as we keep talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.729" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">there&#39;s also a lot of nervous excitement</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:31.300" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:32.889" style="s2">you&#39;re helping me deepen into presents</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.300" end="00:04:38.050" style="s2">before we start I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.889" end="00:04:41.080" style="s2">it&#39;s actually been mixed it&#39;s I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.050" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">consistently the way I write is I know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.080" end="00:04:46.120" style="s2">don&#39;t do it in an effective way I do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:49.479" style="s2">where I just create tons of documents I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.120" end="00:04:51.490" style="s2">make a big mess and then I spend all my</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.479" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">time trying to organize it and in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.490" end="00:04:58.030" style="s2">process is how I was learning this book</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">and and there were times weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.030" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">months maybe where I wasn&#39;t able to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:09.009" style="s2">back in where I felt kicked out in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:12.370" style="s2">last year and but recently when my</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.009" end="00:05:15.580" style="s2">brother died I I had another period</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.370" end="00:05:18.009" style="s2">where I I had just been inspired up</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.580" end="00:05:20.500" style="s2">until he suddenly died and then I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.009" end="00:05:23.379" style="s2">couldn&#39;t touch it for a month so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.500" end="00:05:27.430" style="s2">was in November and then and then in</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.379" end="00:05:29.770" style="s2">descend of December and this month there</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.430" end="00:05:33.069" style="s2">were a few days where I really struggled</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.770" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">with it I felt lost and confused and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.069" end="00:05:36.279" style="s2">know it was overwhelming I thought oh my</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:37.690" style="s2">god I&#39;ve been doing this for a year and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.279" end="00:05:39.849" style="s2">I&#39;m still not ready to have these</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.690" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">interviews and then all of a sudden I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.849" end="00:05:43.449" style="s2">had a breakthrough it started coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:45.099" style="s2">together and I just you know I just said</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.449" end="00:05:47.289" style="s2">I got to stop messing around let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.099" end="00:05:49.240" style="s2">do something already so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.289" end="00:05:52.569" style="s2">organized as I could get it&#39;s the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.240" end="00:05:54.099" style="s2">couple of weeks and and the more I sit</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.569" end="00:05:57.279" style="s2">with it they&#39;re starting to be new</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.099" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">dimensions that I&#39;m seeing for example I</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.279" end="00:06:07.889" style="s2">want to mention that so as I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:11.620" style="s2">the way circling is paralleling</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.889" end="00:06:18.060" style="s2">attachment theory in psychotherapy in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.620" end="00:06:20.919" style="s2">lot of ways that so many people are also</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.060" end="00:06:22.089" style="s2">doing this they&#39;re doing parts of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.919" end="00:06:27.189" style="s2">and I&#39;m just seeing they&#39;re such an</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.089" end="00:06:29.849" style="s2">inherent drive to towards I think so</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.189" end="00:06:33.430" style="s2">many people are naturally discovering</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.849" end="00:06:35.379" style="s2">the like the portals to secure</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.430" end="00:06:38.050" style="s2">attachment without knowing using that</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.379" end="00:06:40.389" style="s2">lens and so one thing I&#39;m wanting is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.050" end="00:06:41.289" style="s2">you know just bring the lens to more and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.389" end="00:06:42.939" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.289" end="00:06:47.529" style="s2">people even if they&#39;ve heard of it to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.939" end="00:06:49.119" style="s2">make it more interesting because often I</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.529" end="00:06:52.300" style="s2">think I think what really makes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.119" end="00:06:54.309" style="s2">difference is when when there&#39;s an equal</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.300" end="00:06:57.189" style="s2">focus on subjectivity and inner</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.309" end="00:07:00.430" style="s2">subjectivity and so psychotherapy can</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.189" end="00:07:04.839" style="s2">often focus more on the intrapsychic and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.430" end="00:07:08.949" style="s2">a little bit on the inner subjective but</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.839" end="00:07:10.719" style="s2">I&#39;m so people are okay interest I kick</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.949" end="00:07:13.749" style="s2">for interest for uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.719" end="00:07:16.419" style="s2">yeah interest psychic like inside yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.749" end="00:07:20.830" style="s2">yourself that&#39;s like subjectivity and</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.630" end="00:08:50.430" style="s2">talking about relationship so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:51.620" style="s2">really emphasizing I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.430" end="00:08:56.190" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.620" end="00:08:59.160" style="s2">the interdependence of being securely</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.190" end="00:09:03.810" style="s2">attached rather than the independence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.160" end="00:09:06.990" style="s2">being avoidant lis attached that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.810" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">attachment for the child creates a field</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.990" end="00:09:15.480" style="s2">that their body our bodies learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">regulate how to feel and what predicts</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.480" end="00:09:21.540" style="s2">attachment is the degree to which what</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:23.670" style="s2">is allowed what experience is allowed</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.540" end="00:09:25.980" style="s2">and what is not allowed what can be felt</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.670" end="00:09:28.170" style="s2">what cannot be felt because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.980" end="00:09:30.990" style="s2">imperative that there is this attachment</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.170" end="00:09:33.620" style="s2">and so the child will like I said last</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.990" end="00:09:35.750" style="s2">time I think we&#39;ll put aside</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.620" end="00:09:40.440" style="s2">unconsciously the things that don&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.750" end="00:09:42.660" style="s2">with the parent and but as adults when</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.440" end="00:09:47.010" style="s2">we get to adulthood then I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.660" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">that is a primary way of recovering like</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.010" end="00:09:53.070" style="s2">I was saying before the hourglass theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:55.500" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t get an actual hourglass yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.070" end="00:09:59.310" style="s2">but I got the next best thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.500" end="00:10:03.300" style="s2">um an image of an hourglass and so let</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:07.670" style="s2">me talk about the original experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.300" end="00:10:11.880" style="s2">and secure attachment being the goal and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.670" end="00:10:15.210" style="s2">that it teaches us these capacities how</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.880" end="00:10:17.190" style="s2">to be in the world but then when we get</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.210" end="00:10:22.140" style="s2">to adulthood if we did not have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.190" end="00:10:25.640" style="s2">secure base established that we can feed</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.140" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">these capacities in different ways and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.640" end="00:10:34.500" style="s2">then it grows that secure base and so is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:36.420" style="s2">it fair to say that basically what</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.500" end="00:10:39.240" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is that like if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.420" end="00:10:41.340" style="s2">have it when you were a kid it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.240" end="00:10:43.380" style="s2">mean that you can&#39;t establish it for</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.340" end="00:10:44.790" style="s2">yourself now yeah that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.380" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">what I&#39;m reading about that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.790" end="00:10:52.380" style="s2">Wallen and the many many people you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:55.530" style="s2">an important lens that the therapist has</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.380" end="00:10:58.590" style="s2">to wake up parts of themselves I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.530" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">doing that for the last five years you</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.590" end="00:11:03.900" style="s2">know with you and with the community</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">here in Berkeley and I like I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.900" end="00:11:07.290" style="s2">been doing it enough I</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.220" end="00:11:08.970" style="s2">want more I need more because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:13.050" style="s2">leading the groups and I found that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.970" end="00:11:14.759" style="s2">harder for me to really wake up these</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.050" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">edges and myself when I&#39;m also holding</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.759" end="00:11:20.519" style="s2">the space and that&#39;s been an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:22.649" style="s2">dialogue as you know and in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.519" end="00:11:25.649" style="s2">wanted to mention one other part I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.649" end="00:11:30.329" style="s2">thinking of Alexis Alexis Shepherd and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.649" end="00:11:33.449" style="s2">was thinking how how well she she does</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.329" end="00:11:38.819" style="s2">these three parts where she she shares</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.449" end="00:11:41.850" style="s2">her direct experience um like subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.819" end="00:11:45.420" style="s2">experience she&#39;s in the interaction she</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.850" end="00:11:47.970" style="s2">reflects she is she&#39;s a tuning with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.420" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">others in the group and she&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.970" end="00:11:54.300" style="s2">the space and I just really see her do</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:56.750" style="s2">those three things really well yes she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.300" end="00:11:59.100" style="s2">quite exceptional at those three dreams</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.750" end="00:12:00.839" style="s2">she&#39;s like almost I would almost say</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:04.829" style="s2">she&#39;s almost kind of like the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.839" end="00:12:07.230" style="s2">of mother and some in some respects yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.829" end="00:12:09.629" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a good way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.230" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">lieblick is a mother rights except when</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.629" end="00:12:15.000" style="s2">I think about a mother and mother logs a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:19.769" style="s2">child like and it&#39;s not just like an</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.000" end="00:12:24.420" style="s2">altruistic act no she&#39;s enjoying the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.769" end="00:12:26.939" style="s2">experience of loving child I my my</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.420" end="00:12:29.730" style="s2">girlfriend&#39;s sister just had a baby and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.939" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">I&#39;m watching I&#39;m watching this pure</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.730" end="00:12:36.120" style="s2">potential of that the family and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:38.250" style="s2">watching the grad fit this new</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.120" end="00:12:41.220" style="s2">grandmother basically look at this child</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.250" end="00:12:43.980" style="s2">and then just you could just list going</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.220" end="00:12:46.379" style="s2">through every cell of her body the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.980" end="00:12:49.529" style="s2">mother and of breanne when they see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.379" end="00:12:54.509" style="s2">child it&#39;s almost it&#39;s as if I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.529" end="00:12:58.199" style="s2">I was on vacation and and they were they</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.509" end="00:13:00.329" style="s2">they that her family the child was</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.199" end="00:13:02.339" style="s2">coming in like a day later and I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.329" end="00:13:05.100" style="s2">taking a nap downstairs and I just had</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.339" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">just started to wake up as the baby was</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.100" end="00:13:11.390" style="s2">coming in and for some reason I was I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:13.970" style="s2">just listen tonight and it and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.390" end="00:13:16.579" style="s2">and instead of imagine like what if what</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.970" end="00:13:19.670" style="s2">if I imagine that baby Jesus was coming</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.579" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">or baby Buddha was coming and I listened</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.670" end="00:13:24.140" style="s2">to the way everyone was responding</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:26.029" style="s2">upstairs and it was exactly it would</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.140" end="00:13:28.279" style="s2">have totally fit it was the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.029" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like oh my god the second</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.279" end="00:13:32.209" style="s2">coming or the or the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:34.519" style="s2">thing in the world and watching the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.209" end="00:13:36.950" style="s2">energy that this is what I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.519" end="00:13:42.260" style="s2">children give back because there are a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.950" end="00:13:44.420" style="s2">lot of work there are a lot of work so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.260" end="00:13:46.940" style="s2">think the payback for having kids is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.420" end="00:13:49.190" style="s2">that we get we get a direct intimation</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.940" end="00:13:51.740" style="s2">of what we&#39;re like or I have a direct a</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.190" end="00:13:54.050" style="s2">direct intimation of the pure potential</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.740" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">that a human being is because when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.050" end="00:13:59.990" style="s2">think about what one single human being</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:03.560" style="s2">is capable of it is profound</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.990" end="00:14:06.040" style="s2">to be with an infant right it&#39;s profound</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.560" end="00:14:08.899" style="s2">to be with an infant and it seems the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.040" end="00:14:10.760" style="s2">biological response to that like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.899" end="00:14:13.490" style="s2">spiritual response to that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.760" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">deeply rooted in the body because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.490" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">can feel the whole family mmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:23.209" style="s2">gather around as if a bright pure light</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:26.300" style="s2">was coming into being proximity to the</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.840" end="00:17:38.190" style="s2">up as a as a of excitation and then the</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.460" end="00:17:48.980" style="s2">seemed to have this kind of movement of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.310" end="00:17:52.680" style="s2">excitation build up and release</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.980" end="00:17:55.080" style="s2">excitation build up in a release so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.680" end="00:17:56.460" style="s2">how I&#39;m here like that&#39;s what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.080" end="00:17:59.400" style="s2">of as you&#39;re talking about it so I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.460" end="00:18:02.280" style="s2">imagine if the mother if that if that</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.400" end="00:18:05.910" style="s2">was if there was a buildup of excitation</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.280" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">instead of I need being mad instead it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.910" end="00:18:09.960" style="s2">was like they got the nipple but it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:11.970" style="s2">filled with like the mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.960" end="00:18:13.500" style="s2">insecurities about whether or not she</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.970" end="00:18:14.040" style="s2">knows how to do it or she&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.500" end="00:18:18.110" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.040" end="00:18:22.410" style="s2">or if Shh he got met with the Blake like</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.110" end="00:18:25.650" style="s2">effective disdain or frustration or some</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.410" end="00:18:29.430" style="s2">version other than oh let me meet your</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.650" end="00:18:31.320" style="s2">need then that excitation builds up and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.430" end="00:18:34.500" style="s2">then at a certain point you probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.320" end="00:18:37.800" style="s2">crosses threshold it&#39;s right yes yes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:41.160" style="s2">in in that that crossing of threshold</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.800" end="00:18:46.710" style="s2">over a number of times starts a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.160" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">in your nervous system and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.710" end="00:18:51.150" style="s2">one thing that I think there&#39;s two parts</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:52.980" style="s2">that I think that quote was focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.150" end="00:18:54.120" style="s2">that there&#39;s overarching concepts to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.980" end="00:18:57.210" style="s2">carry through everything we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.120" end="00:18:59.790" style="s2">about that circling is doing which is we</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.210" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">are practicing emotional attunement</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.790" end="00:19:05.610" style="s2">effect attunements and the idea is when</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:09.450" style="s2">that&#39;s happening it&#39;s helping the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.610" end="00:19:12.300" style="s2">to regulate effect so that&#39;s one very</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.450" end="00:19:14.030" style="s2">important part and just so so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.300" end="00:19:18.510" style="s2">clear about some of these technologies</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.030" end="00:19:20.940" style="s2">when you mean regulate right when we</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.510" end="00:19:25.110" style="s2">self-regulate what what are you actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.940" end="00:19:27.350" style="s2">referring to well I think that it is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.110" end="00:19:32.820" style="s2">way you just describe that excitement</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.350" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">emerges in in the system and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.820" end="00:19:38.670" style="s2">feel it first of all because we can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:41.460" style="s2">dissociated from the feelings and we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.670" end="00:19:44.460" style="s2">just be in thoughts or images or spaced</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.460" end="00:19:48.600" style="s2">out many different responses to not</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.460" end="00:19:52.890" style="s2">being directly connected to the arise</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.600" end="00:19:57.470" style="s2">the rise and fall of energy in the body</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.890" end="00:20:01.920" style="s2">and so regulating means that you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.470" end="00:20:03.690" style="s2">that you have options for how to manage</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.920" end="00:20:05.340" style="s2">the energy you couldn&#39;t you have enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.690" end="00:20:08.790" style="s2">ability to say if you&#39;re with people</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.340" end="00:20:10.470" style="s2">okay hold on I need a minute and just</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.790" end="00:20:13.380" style="s2">either you stay there and you breathe or</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.470" end="00:20:15.330" style="s2">you say can you go take a walk with me I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.380" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">mean you have these you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.330" end="00:20:20.430" style="s2">this is part of mentalizing is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:22.500" style="s2">ability to perceive different things</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.430" end="00:20:24.210" style="s2">that are happening within you and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.500" end="00:20:27.540" style="s2">relationship and to be able to choose</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.210" end="00:20:29.070" style="s2">options for how to respond so we&#39;ll of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.540" end="00:20:31.340" style="s2">course you&#39;re getting to that next time</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.070" end="00:20:33.240" style="s2">you say when people say you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.340" end="00:20:34.800" style="s2">encircling a lot of times people say</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.240" end="00:20:36.840" style="s2">like to collect a lot more grounded</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.800" end="00:20:40.230" style="s2">hearing that yeah look a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.840" end="00:20:41.670" style="s2">centered or more in my body is that like</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.230" end="00:20:44.730" style="s2">he could say is like in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.670" end="00:20:46.890" style="s2">that&#39;s them them feeling self regulated</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.730" end="00:20:49.410" style="s2">yeah or when they stop and make it like</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.890" end="00:20:51.240" style="s2">they take a deep breath and they just</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.410" end="00:20:53.790" style="s2">kind of breathe into the intensity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.240" end="00:20:56.430" style="s2">make room for the intensity such that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.790" end="00:20:58.890" style="s2">they can like have it versus it having</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.430" end="00:21:02.460" style="s2">them or something absolutely and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.890" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a term also a mutual regulation</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.460" end="00:21:06.810" style="s2">something like that and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:08.670" style="s2">encircling we&#39;re off we can often be</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.810" end="00:21:10.920" style="s2">doing it mutually and then self</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.670" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">regulating is is I think more where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.920" end="00:21:18.090" style="s2">feel contained within yourself right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:19.530" style="s2">so there&#39;s a way in which regulation can</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.090" end="00:21:22.140" style="s2">happen you can integrate and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.530" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">self-regulate in insults ooh is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.140" end="00:21:27.630" style="s2">another term like self soothing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">sometimes can be part of it regulation</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.630" end="00:21:32.010" style="s2">but then there&#39;s what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:34.500" style="s2">that there&#39;s the possibility of insecure</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.010" end="00:21:37.590" style="s2">attachment bonds we&#39;re where we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.500" end="00:21:39.930" style="s2">couple and relate to each other in such</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.590" end="00:21:44.550" style="s2">a way that we can we can regulate each</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.930" end="00:21:46.560" style="s2">other and that&#39;s that and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.550" end="00:21:48.600" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really what we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.560" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">get getting at is like the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.600" end="00:21:53.640" style="s2">of relationships ways of interacting</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:56.370" style="s2">where both of us feel much more enriched</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.640" end="00:21:59.400" style="s2">and regulated and centered in our own</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.370" end="00:22:02.220" style="s2">experience and I think maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.400" end="00:22:04.650" style="s2">jump over all this stuff I wish we could</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.220" end="00:22:05.820" style="s2">talk about but go to how we listen in</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.650" end="00:22:09.960" style="s2">circling because</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.820" end="00:22:13.980" style="s2">I think that what I was saying in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.960" end="00:22:16.200" style="s2">last segment was this is this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.980" end="00:22:20.220" style="s2">take a creative leap right so much of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.200" end="00:22:22.950" style="s2">Wallens every his outline of his book so</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.220" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">much peril easily is paralleling and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.950" end="00:22:28.770" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing encircling but in many</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:33.740" style="s2">ways but then this leap that I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.770" end="00:22:37.320" style="s2">is that the question of if a surrogate</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.740" end="00:22:41.540" style="s2">field a surrogate caregiver a surrogate</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.320" end="00:22:44.400" style="s2">secure base a surrogate safe haven is is</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.540" end="00:22:46.350" style="s2">created because of the mutual agreements</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.400" end="00:22:48.510" style="s2">that we have so that we may not even</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.350" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">know each other but because we know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.510" end="00:22:54.270" style="s2">we are here to welcome everything we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:57.240" style="s2">welcome to welcome our subjective</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.270" end="00:22:58.650" style="s2">experience each other&#39;s experience we</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.240" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">know that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do even</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.650" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">when we can&#39;t even in moments where we</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:06.540" style="s2">feel shut down or we feel upset we know</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:09.660" style="s2">ultimately there&#39;s a field that&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.540" end="00:23:12.810" style="s2">it&#39;s okay we welcome the shutdown you</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.660" end="00:23:14.640" style="s2">know that that the most basic agreement</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.810" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">is that we are agreeing to be in</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:18.840" style="s2">relationship so even if we just</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:21.660" style="s2">acknowledge I don&#39;t know how to do it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.840" end="00:23:26.940" style="s2">this moment there&#39;s still a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.660" end="00:23:30.990" style="s2">intention saying yes I&#39;m willing to find</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.940" end="00:23:33.660" style="s2">my way back to relating with you I may</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.990" end="00:23:37.500" style="s2">not be with you yeah like I&#39;ve thrown a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.660" end="00:23:39.090" style="s2">beacon out your language I&#39;m here and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.500" end="00:23:41.430" style="s2">I&#39;m connected to you and I&#39;m gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.090" end="00:23:43.290" style="s2">my way back yeah because I I have this</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.430" end="00:23:45.240" style="s2">idea you can tell me what you think but</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.290" end="00:23:47.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve often said this I think if people</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.240" end="00:23:49.020" style="s2">if sometimes I&#39;ll ask someone are you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.400" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">willing to be in relationship when</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.020" end="00:23:53.730" style="s2">somebody is really something&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">edgy and they&#39;re just they seem like</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.730" end="00:23:56.790" style="s2">they don&#39;t care anymore</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:59.640" style="s2">you know and I&#39;ve heard somebody say</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.790" end="00:24:02.160" style="s2">once no and I made the decision to stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.640" end="00:24:03.810" style="s2">the circle I said okay wait if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.160" end="00:24:05.250" style="s2">not willing to be in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.810" end="00:24:07.800" style="s2">these people right now then we need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.250" end="00:24:10.530" style="s2">pause timeout because to me it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.800" end="00:24:13.140" style="s2">breaking the agreements and I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.530" end="00:24:14.700" style="s2">what you think about that I think it</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.140" end="00:24:16.950" style="s2">depends on the situation it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.700" end="00:24:19.180" style="s2">it sounds like you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.950" end="00:24:21.730" style="s2">commitments you could say that we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.180" end="00:24:25.390" style="s2">is to relationship we&#39;re staying</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.730" end="00:24:28.420" style="s2">connected and so if the person was in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.390" end="00:24:31.870" style="s2">the person was like nope no more and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.420" end="00:24:33.430" style="s2">they were closed about it right that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.870" end="00:24:36.010" style="s2">it yeah it was it like they were just</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.430" end="00:24:37.780" style="s2">kind of taking care of themselves which</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.010" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">is which is waves actually staying</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.780" end="00:24:42.460" style="s2">connected to somebody yes I agree but</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:44.230" style="s2">there was a way of just kind of climbing</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.460" end="00:24:46.210" style="s2">walling it up and good shunning or</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.230" end="00:24:48.340" style="s2">something or other ring you they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.210" end="00:24:49.810" style="s2">saying I was not willing to be affected</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.340" end="00:24:53.470" style="s2">by the other basically I&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.810" end="00:24:55.540" style="s2">willing yeah totally yeah that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.470" end="00:24:58.220" style="s2">just breaks the rules of the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.540" end="00:25:00.409" style="s2">what I was yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.220" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">was there another quote he wanted to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.409" end="00:25:05.330" style="s2">into yeah so there will be a few here so</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:08.090" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about we&#39;ll focus mostly on</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.330" end="00:25:10.010" style="s2">listening principles but maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.090" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">just talk a little bit first on how you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.010" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">describe you know when we have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:17.000" style="s2">Thursday night drop encircling night</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.500" style="s2">well you always say it differently what</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.000" end="00:25:20.210" style="s2">would you say right now about how we</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.500" end="00:25:22.929" style="s2">listen what that&#39;s one of the three</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.210" end="00:25:32.450" style="s2">agreements encircling that we use right</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.929" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">what would you say so so for me I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.450" end="00:25:40.850" style="s2">say that like actually it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:43.640" style="s2">listening in the way that we listen as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.850" end="00:25:47.570" style="s2">virtue and there&#39;s a standard and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.640" end="00:25:49.549" style="s2">come from encircling I&#39;ve really caught</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.570" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">that has been the most transformative</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.549" end="00:25:55.309" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s transformed to me through</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:57.230" style="s2">circling is it&#39;s surprisingly so um I</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.309" end="00:25:59.690" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t have thought that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.230" end="00:26:01.820" style="s2">advance like well how does listening how</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.690" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">could listening transform you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.820" end="00:26:08.140" style="s2">you&#39;re just paying attention right what</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.880" end="00:26:11.780" style="s2">I love I I think I&#39;m still I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.140" end="00:26:15.559" style="s2">grokking how how deep listen it goes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.780" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">what we mean by listening in this way is</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.559" end="00:26:22.669" style="s2">to genuinely listen to another human</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:24.380" style="s2">being as a genuine human being is a real</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.669" end="00:26:27.950" style="s2">human being or as Mark Martin Buber</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.380" end="00:26:32.120" style="s2">would say as a genuine I though you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.950" end="00:26:35.270" style="s2">though in other words you I relate to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:38.780" style="s2">you not as a means to an end</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.270" end="00:26:41.780" style="s2">but as an end in yourself if you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.780" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">feel it like in Gruber talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.780" end="00:26:47.570" style="s2">also as you know he pairs it off he says</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:49.429" style="s2">you know to be existentially to be human</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.570" end="00:26:52.039" style="s2">being is to be a relationship we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.429" end="00:26:53.960" style="s2">always in relationship with entities and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.039" end="00:26:57.530" style="s2">events and ourselves and other people</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.960" end="00:27:01.400" style="s2">and that we comport or the way that our</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.530" end="00:27:03.380" style="s2">stance towards that relationship he puts</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.400" end="00:27:05.350" style="s2">in two categories one is an i8</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.380" end="00:27:07.549" style="s2">relationship and one is danaiah</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.350" end="00:27:10.909" style="s2">relationship and he says that both are</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.549" end="00:27:11.660" style="s2">spoken is one word and I it and I that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.909" end="00:27:14.780" style="s2">there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.660" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">I pull and the other pull and he says</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.780" end="00:27:21.290" style="s2">like when I relate to you isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:25.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not relating to you as an entity</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.290" end="00:27:28.430" style="s2">illegitimate meaningful entities in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.040" end="00:27:31.220" style="s2">yourself I&#39;m relating to you as a means</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.430" end="00:27:34.460" style="s2">to an end right if you can kind of feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:35.900" style="s2">the I that comes up if I were just a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.460" end="00:27:38.600" style="s2">like for example if I were to start to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.900" end="00:27:40.970" style="s2">relate to you as a means to my need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.600" end="00:27:43.610" style="s2">get to meet my needs to be accepted or</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.970" end="00:27:46.760" style="s2">approved up right in some way you kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.610" end="00:27:50.300" style="s2">of feel the I that forms in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.760" end="00:27:53.240" style="s2">to that versus if I if I meet you and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.300" end="00:27:57.740" style="s2">listen to you and apprehend you as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.240" end="00:27:59.870" style="s2">though and I really really want to come</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.740" end="00:28:01.880" style="s2">in contact with not what I already know</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.870" end="00:28:04.520" style="s2">about you but what I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.880" end="00:28:07.730" style="s2">you right and if you can kind of feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.520" end="00:28:10.250" style="s2">the respectfulness that comes with being</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.730" end="00:28:15.890" style="s2">with a legitimate other you feel the I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.250" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">that emerges with that right in that in</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.890" end="00:28:22.160" style="s2">that in that primordial relational event</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:25.040" style="s2">I thou so if you think about listening</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.160" end="00:28:28.880" style="s2">from that angle listening becomes not</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.040" end="00:28:32.690" style="s2">something simply where you just are an</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.880" end="00:28:35.450" style="s2">empty head being quiet paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.690" end="00:28:38.090" style="s2">being filled with information right I</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.450" end="00:28:39.890" style="s2">think that&#39;s the common sense notion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.090" end="00:28:41.300" style="s2">listening is that like being a good</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.890" end="00:28:43.490" style="s2">listener is simply being quiet and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.300" end="00:28:45.530" style="s2">paying attention to what you say like as</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.490" end="00:28:47.240" style="s2">if we open you open my head up and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.530" end="00:28:48.740" style="s2">fill it with words and once it&#39;s filled</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.240" end="00:28:51.710" style="s2">and you&#39;re done talking we close that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.740" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">and then I process the information and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.710" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">then I and then I respond back to you in</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.610" style="s2">some way but that&#39;s not the that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:01.790" style="s2">the phenomenological that&#39;s not the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.610" end="00:29:04.190" style="s2">we experience listening right how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.790" end="00:29:08.830" style="s2">experience listening is there&#39;s this way</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.190" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">in which I in listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.830" end="00:29:14.420" style="s2">especially in the I thou sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.480" end="00:29:17.390" style="s2">word genuinely really really listening</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.420" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">to who you are in your full humanity</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.390" end="00:29:24.560" style="s2">right is in a certain sense is to is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.100" end="00:29:25.560" style="s2">listen to you is to open up the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.560" end="00:29:29.580" style="s2">makes sense</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.350" end="00:29:49.500" style="s2">experience of hearing you right I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.500" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">touchable I make myself being in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.290" end="00:29:58.290" style="s2">certain sense being affected sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:30:01.290" style="s2">really deeply yeah I think that I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.290" end="00:30:03.390" style="s2">that listening to so many people open</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.290" end="00:30:06.680" style="s2">their hearts and finding out who they</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.390" end="00:30:09.300" style="s2">were at the deepest level it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.680" end="00:30:11.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like accompanying people and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.300" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">listening to people that way I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.400" end="00:30:17.040" style="s2">listened to people that have been so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:21.090" style="s2">moving and so courageous and just blown</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.040" end="00:30:23.670" style="s2">me away that I that that it&#39;s altered</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.090" end="00:30:26.460" style="s2">the way that I see reality through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.670" end="00:30:28.920" style="s2">process of listening to them and that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.460" end="00:30:32.610" style="s2">would say that that that how you feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.920" end="00:30:35.010" style="s2">heard is to the degree that you can that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.610" end="00:30:38.700" style="s2">I can communicate to you how I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.010" end="00:30:40.560" style="s2">changed by what you&#39;re saying and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.700" end="00:30:44.850" style="s2">the experience where people feel deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.560" end="00:30:46.350" style="s2">hurt right it&#39;s a full embodiment so</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.850" end="00:30:49.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a component to it where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.350" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">a there&#39;s a embodied attunement there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.170" end="00:30:54.780" style="s2">a kind of a listening body where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:56.820" style="s2">a porosity right in the stance a I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.780" end="00:31:00.870" style="s2">really gonna I&#39;m gonna bring my whole</p>

<p begin="00:31:00.870" end="00:31:08.610" style="s2">attuned to you on a on a primordial</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">physical and body level you know open</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.610" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">myself up to you at a nonverbal level</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:17.790" style="s2">right and that is really really</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:20.520" style="s2">important and in such that the words</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.790" end="00:31:23.460" style="s2">that you say already happened with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.520" end="00:31:25.860" style="s2">arise from a sense of attunement right</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.460" end="00:31:29.730" style="s2">as if you had a tone and I had its own</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.860" end="00:31:31.790" style="s2">and in listening to you I&#39;m tuning in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.730" end="00:31:35.250" style="s2">a bodily way</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.790" end="00:31:37.650" style="s2">so the to your particular tone right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.250" end="00:31:38.900" style="s2">out of that animates the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.650" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.900" end="00:31:43.809" style="s2">and you can feel the tonality of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:46.700" style="s2">change as the conversation happens right</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.809" end="00:31:49.160" style="s2">you can feel the relationship and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.700" end="00:31:51.680" style="s2">tones start to be contributed to both of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.160" end="00:31:55.400" style="s2">us right and that&#39;s where you start to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.680" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">create these really epic beautiful deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.400" end="00:32:01.970" style="s2">rich connections and conversations where</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:03.920" style="s2">at a certain point it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.970" end="00:32:05.450" style="s2">say that like the two human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.920" end="00:32:06.920" style="s2">the source of the conversation it starts</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.450" end="00:32:09.530" style="s2">to feel like the conversation of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.920" end="00:32:11.929" style="s2">relationship starts degree to people Wow</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.530" end="00:32:13.820" style="s2">and those are the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.929" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">have I think we&#39;re people that really</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.820" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">take take a note of circling oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:19.220" style="s2">this is really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.840" style="s2">you mean I could just meet a stranger</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.220" end="00:32:23.960" style="s2">and sit down and have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.840" end="00:32:27.010" style="s2">conversation a way that enriched and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.960" end="00:32:29.420" style="s2">transformed that&#39;s what&#39;s possible yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.010" end="00:32:31.670" style="s2">so one thing I was noting is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.420" end="00:32:34.760" style="s2">just at least four different parts that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.670" end="00:32:37.960" style="s2">you describe that are basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.760" end="00:32:41.420" style="s2">word-for-word you know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.960" end="00:32:45.140" style="s2">therapists are doing in psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.420" end="00:32:48.050" style="s2">but yet there&#39;s this way of still</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.140" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">holding oneself back to a degree right</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.050" end="00:32:54.830" style="s2">so there&#39;s a therapist yeah and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:59.240" style="s2">in circle is you&#39;re two human beings or</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.830" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">two or more meeting and an equal ground</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.240" end="00:33:05.110" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the part where I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:10.730" style="s2">circling is an incredible compliment to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.110" end="00:33:13.790" style="s2">attachment therapy because it brings it</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.730" end="00:33:17.800" style="s2">gives people the ultimate lesson they</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.790" end="00:33:20.270" style="s2">need which is how to be equally in</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.800" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">relationship not just somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.270" end="00:33:25.370" style="s2">only looking for your best interest</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:28.670" style="s2">and putting aside their own personal</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.370" end="00:33:30.650" style="s2">needs a lot of the time right to show up</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.670" end="00:33:34.460" style="s2">it gets infinitely more complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.650" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">encircling you can get messy but in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.460" end="00:33:42.250" style="s2">mess and then the repair is where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:42.250" style="s2">learning and the healing happens also Oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.220" end="00:33:48.770" style="s2">so you know one thing you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.070" end="00:33:50.840" style="s2">mentioning was about the the approach to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.770" end="00:33:52.580" style="s2">the other person and you I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.840" end="00:33:54.530" style="s2">think you said this phrase but you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.580" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">referring to assuming positive intent or</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.530" end="00:34:03.680" style="s2">maybe you did say it and I guess to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:05.660" style="s2">it when weird when we&#39;re doing that if</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.680" end="00:34:08.690" style="s2">you bring this to any relation adult</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.660" end="00:34:10.730" style="s2">relationship you have it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.690" end="00:34:13.130" style="s2">creating a mind state where if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.730" end="00:34:15.670" style="s2">you really learn to make that a practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.130" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">where you assume positive intent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.670" end="00:34:23.330" style="s2">then you&#39;re not leading with that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re working that edge from thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.330" end="00:34:28.070" style="s2">you&#39;re insulting me right or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:30.890" style="s2">understand me</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.070" end="00:34:32.150" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a really complex place right</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.890" end="00:34:34.640" style="s2">when you feet when there&#39;s this when</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.150" end="00:34:38.840" style="s2">there&#39;s some things at stake and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.640" end="00:34:41.000" style="s2">want someone to get you and and if two</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.840" end="00:34:43.240" style="s2">people who practice circling together</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.000" end="00:34:46.750" style="s2">but you know you&#39;re in relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.240" end="00:34:49.850" style="s2">family members but you can bring that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.750" end="00:34:52.010" style="s2">stance of positive intent I think it it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.850" end="00:34:54.860" style="s2">teaches the other that you will assume</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.010" end="00:34:56.840" style="s2">the best of me under stress and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.860" end="00:35:01.160" style="s2">does something I think that just creates</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.840" end="00:35:03.710" style="s2">a base to rest into yeah just get</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.160" end="00:35:08.090" style="s2">stressed yeah but to find that pathway</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.710" end="00:35:09.860" style="s2">of wait what&#39;s the deeper something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.090" end="00:35:12.020" style="s2">hurting here you know what&#39;s the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.860" end="00:35:15.170" style="s2">meaning and to just let go of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.020" end="00:35:17.090" style="s2">expression of it just get to the you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.170" end="00:35:19.280" style="s2">know that&#39;s one thing we practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.090" end="00:35:23.780" style="s2">encircling another and I&#39;ll have a quote</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.280" end="00:35:28.460" style="s2">for you to read is in we listen for how</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.780" end="00:35:30.920" style="s2">things make sense what one more part</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.460" end="00:35:33.410" style="s2">should positive intent so like when we</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.920" end="00:35:35.000" style="s2">when we practice that that&#39;s a committed</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.410" end="00:35:38.090" style="s2">thing that we do in circling it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.000" end="00:35:39.620" style="s2">intent that we have is is that we say</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.090" end="00:35:41.480" style="s2">that like one of the ways we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.620" end="00:35:43.430" style="s2">listen to each other is really listen</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.480" end="00:35:45.980" style="s2">for and assumed positive intent</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.430" end="00:35:48.110" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean liking what the person</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.980" end="00:35:51.320" style="s2">says or what they&#39;re doing does have</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.110" end="00:35:54.110" style="s2">anything to do with approval right right</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.320" end="00:35:56.450" style="s2">more like assuming that the person is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.110" end="00:35:59.119" style="s2">doing the best they can</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.450" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">with what they&#39;re given yeah and even if</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.119" end="00:36:03.020" style="s2">they don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:06.440" style="s2">really listening for that and holding</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.020" end="00:36:08.510" style="s2">them in that way and what I have found</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.440" end="00:36:10.430" style="s2">and I&#39;ve watched people who have</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.510" end="00:36:14.140" style="s2">practiced at that at first it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.430" end="00:36:16.609" style="s2">like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a stance they take on</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.140" end="00:36:18.740" style="s2">almost like they wear it which is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.609" end="00:36:21.109" style="s2">start like a coat like kind of a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.740" end="00:36:23.480" style="s2">sexual thing but then as time goes on</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.109" end="00:36:27.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched people literally be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.480" end="00:36:30.020" style="s2">perceive the innocence and people right</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.560" end="00:36:33.220" style="s2">to actually have that to be to be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.020" end="00:36:36.770" style="s2">to have that have a limbic felt almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.220" end="00:36:40.190" style="s2">sensory visceral hit but when somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.770" end="00:36:42.680" style="s2">just being a bastard right screaming at</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.190" end="00:36:45.829" style="s2">their face like actually being able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.680" end="00:36:47.990" style="s2">like deal with the conversation but hold</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.829" end="00:36:50.450" style="s2">that person and actually feel the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.990" end="00:36:54.230" style="s2">innocence of that person right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.450" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">understand that person as in attuned way</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.230" end="00:37:00.349" style="s2">but that&#39;s actually possible to develop</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:03.140" style="s2">and to feel to actually perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.349" end="00:37:06.589" style="s2">spark of light of purity that&#39;s within</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.140" end="00:37:08.859" style="s2">everybody jet and like just like when</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.589" end="00:37:11.930" style="s2">you practice yoga there&#39;s asanas</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.859" end="00:37:14.089" style="s2">positions that you hold in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.930" end="00:37:16.280" style="s2">sense there are you could say relational</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.089" end="00:37:18.349" style="s2">asanas that we hold right and some will</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.280" end="00:37:20.690" style="s2">be harder for like like for example that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.349" end="00:37:22.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve been lifting weights for years so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.690" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">hate downward dog</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.970" end="00:37:27.619" style="s2">maybe fortress-like the best thing for</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:29.660" style="s2">me but I hate the yoga instructors I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.619" end="00:37:30.950" style="s2">feel like that they&#39;re just like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.660" end="00:37:33.160" style="s2">know they&#39;re st. and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.950" end="00:37:36.470" style="s2">like that because I hate but I you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.160" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">I get done with it and then I walk</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.470" end="00:37:40.579" style="s2">outside when I&#39;m not thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:44.150" style="s2">doing downward dog my natural resting</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.579" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">bit like face is more open and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.150" end="00:37:48.710" style="s2">the same is ways when you hold an</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:51.050" style="s2">intention of seeing the positive intent</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.710" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">and other people and you stretch so as</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.050" end="00:37:55.369" style="s2">that person is doing saying that thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:57.290" style="s2">that&#39;s like just like your mother said</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.369" end="00:38:00.849" style="s2">to you and it&#39;s activating everything in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.290" end="00:38:04.790" style="s2">your life you&#39;re practicing feeling for</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.849" end="00:38:08.060" style="s2">the innocence even as they&#39;re burning</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.790" end="00:38:09.800" style="s2">you in a certain sense feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.060" end="00:38:13.640" style="s2">right and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.800" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">stretch those capacities and in and hold</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.640" end="00:38:18.770" style="s2">off on what you maybe normally would do</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:22.040" style="s2">which is usually a form of judgment and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.770" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">so it to have that stance of listening</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.040" end="00:38:27.170" style="s2">for positive intent I think it changes</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:29.900" style="s2">our own physiology I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.170" end="00:38:31.580" style="s2">softening and an opening and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.900" end="00:38:33.020" style="s2">listening changes our body state which</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.580" end="00:38:35.120" style="s2">is one of the things we keep wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.020" end="00:38:38.390" style="s2">track as we talk here you know how the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.120" end="00:38:40.790" style="s2">body changes and because when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.390" end="00:38:43.490" style="s2">about how when you know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.790" end="00:38:44.060" style="s2">eating each other right we know I know</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.490" end="00:38:47.870" style="s2">who you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.060" end="00:38:49.670" style="s2">everything narrows and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.870" end="00:38:51.560" style="s2">where the judge just says I know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.670" end="00:38:53.780" style="s2">happening I know what I think about it I</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.560" end="00:38:55.790" style="s2">don&#39;t like it so when you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.780" end="00:38:57.260" style="s2">when you&#39;re you exercising your leg</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.790" end="00:38:59.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s really cool about circling</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.260" end="00:39:01.490" style="s2">is it&#39;s a practice it&#39;s a it&#39;s a chance</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.360" end="00:39:04.130" style="s2">to practice these kinds of relational</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.490" end="00:39:05.780" style="s2">asanas yes such that when you walk on a</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.130" end="00:39:09.260" style="s2">circling and you&#39;re not thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.780" end="00:39:11.720" style="s2">circling when that person says that</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.260" end="00:39:15.830" style="s2">thing to you you find yourself just</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.720" end="00:39:17.930" style="s2">naturally more open tuned way right</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.830" end="00:39:19.880" style="s2">without having to think about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.930" end="00:39:21.710" style="s2">you could say this circling are almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.880" end="00:39:23.660" style="s2">like you could say in speaking in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.710" end="00:39:26.990" style="s2">journey if we connected to attachment</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.660" end="00:39:30.020" style="s2">theory our ways of our postures or</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.990" end="00:39:31.460" style="s2">relational asanas that fosters something</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:34.910" style="s2">like secure attachment that we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.460" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">practice in extreme ways yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.910" end="00:39:38.450" style="s2">you can walk out there and talk to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:40.760" style="s2">everybody like you&#39;re in a circle but</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.450" end="00:39:42.800" style="s2">such that you&#39;re embodied response</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.760" end="00:39:44.990" style="s2">becomes a lot more integrated and more</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.800" end="00:39:47.180" style="s2">open to something like having more a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.990" end="00:39:49.720" style="s2">secure base in your life that the people</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.180" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">around you that&#39;s what I&#39;m imagining and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.720" end="00:39:58.330" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this phrase that oh my</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">gosh I&#39;m mixing up Oh Daniel Seagle</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.330" end="00:40:01.820" style="s2">first you and I know I think he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:05.740" style="s2">referring to somebody else who coined</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.820" end="00:40:07.850" style="s2">this concept of states into traits and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.740" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">so I imagine that we&#39;re practicing</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.850" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">States those are the asanas and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:15.500" style="s2">when you the more every every new habit</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:17.750" style="s2">changing a habit requires repetition so</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.500" end="00:40:19.730" style="s2">that&#39;s why having a place to practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.750" end="00:40:21.590" style="s2">over and over and over and it&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.730" end="00:40:23.060" style="s2">every time which is what was that called</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.590" end="00:40:23.750" style="s2">in training where you don&#39;t do the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.060" end="00:40:26.240" style="s2">thing every time</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.750" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">I&#39;m like CrossFit or I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:29.360" style="s2">you know I&#39;m just getting into that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:31.490" style="s2">myself but I forgot the term where are</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.360" end="00:40:34.820" style="s2">you yeah you have to surprise your body</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.490" end="00:40:38.120" style="s2">and shock your body that part yes so</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.820" end="00:40:39.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like that every circling drop at</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.120" end="00:40:41.810" style="s2">night is different different people</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.650" end="00:40:44.120" style="s2">different people get circled that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.810" end="00:40:46.700" style="s2">feel differently it&#39;s always different</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.120" end="00:40:48.140" style="s2">so it is edgy it can be edging a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.700" end="00:40:50.350" style="s2">ways but if you&#39;re committed to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.140" end="00:40:54.650" style="s2">practice you start to realize there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.350" end="00:40:59.180" style="s2">this enduring overall benefit you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.650" end="00:41:01.730" style="s2">so in practicing you get to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.180" end="00:41:04.340" style="s2">mistakes you have liberties to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.730" end="00:41:07.220" style="s2">mistakes and it&#39;s encouraged yeah work</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.340" end="00:41:09.020" style="s2">through those mistakes that like that if</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.220" end="00:41:10.940" style="s2">you were to do the same thing and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.020" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">in your real life it could have</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.940" end="00:41:15.740" style="s2">consequences that are too risky yes but</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:18.890" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of the safety is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.740" end="00:41:21.500" style="s2">part huge where people come in and say</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.890" end="00:41:23.030" style="s2">am i doing it wrong how do I do it right</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.500" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">and I really relate to that you know of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.030" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">course we want to be have a general idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:29.420" style="s2">or am i doing am I in the ballpark right</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:31.070" style="s2">but I like it when you keep reminding</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.420" end="00:41:32.900" style="s2">people it&#39;s okay to make mistakes just</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.070" end="00:41:37.400" style="s2">do just say what you&#39;re gonna say and be</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.900" end="00:41:39.980" style="s2">open to being coached you know or just</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.400" end="00:41:41.330" style="s2">you know reflected to if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.980" end="00:41:43.580" style="s2">really missing the mark you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.330" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">advice you know if you&#39;re judging just</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.580" end="00:41:48.500" style="s2">owning the experience because like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">said we in our life there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.500" end="00:41:53.900" style="s2">consequences for making mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:57.290" style="s2">people you know get can many people</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.900" end="00:41:59.930" style="s2">might be overly cautious and that just</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.290" end="00:42:03.560" style="s2">becomes a way of being of not all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.930" end="00:42:05.300" style="s2">that experience that isn&#39;t is not even</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.560" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">allowed to be expressed we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.300" end="00:42:10.730" style="s2">don&#39;t get angry or we don&#39;t love or you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:13.550" style="s2">know or we don&#39;t cry like these are this</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.730" end="00:42:15.170" style="s2">is again a this is where circling to me</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.550" end="00:42:16.760" style="s2">an attachment theory are just totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.170" end="00:42:18.620" style="s2">paralleling because we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.760" end="00:42:21.170" style="s2">the same thing about waking up these</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.620" end="00:42:24.220" style="s2">parts of ourselves that were not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.170" end="00:42:26.330" style="s2">in our adult life to expressed and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.220" end="00:42:28.670" style="s2">having a place where we can practice a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.330" end="00:42:30.620" style="s2">little bit and it&#39;s like the child</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.670" end="00:42:33.290" style="s2">learning to walk you have to do it from</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.620" end="00:42:35.380" style="s2">the inside you can&#39;t just be told like</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.290" end="00:42:37.190" style="s2">watching this video we&#39;re telling you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.380" end="00:42:41.869" style="s2">you Liss</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.190" end="00:42:44.270" style="s2">audience what the parts are but until</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.869" end="00:42:46.789" style="s2">we&#39;re each doing it ourselves we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.270" end="00:42:53.420" style="s2">you know we have to work those edges</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.789" end="00:42:54.859" style="s2">from the inside right yeah so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.420" end="00:42:57.410" style="s2">can so you can read the next one which</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.859" end="00:42:59.450" style="s2">is we listen for how things make sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.410" end="00:43:01.400" style="s2">and you can see that that&#39;s written</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.450" end="00:43:04.819" style="s2">about in the book the survey again</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.400" end="00:43:08.089" style="s2">second we must respond to the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.819" end="00:43:11.089" style="s2">intentions feelings and beliefs that are</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:33.770" style="s2">feel understood in depth and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.309" end="00:43:37.930" style="s2">translates into a feeling of being</p>

<p begin="00:45:33.750" end="00:45:38.940" style="s2">acceptance it&#39;s like cool like yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.900" end="00:45:41.130" style="s2">I feel like you love me accept me can</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.940" end="00:45:44.280" style="s2">use human being but I so don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.130" end="00:45:46.410" style="s2">understood and I was just complete so</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.280" end="00:45:53.069" style="s2">until you I go but once you add in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.410" end="00:45:56.780" style="s2">thumb the understanding is like always</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.069" end="00:46:01.140" style="s2">been just absolutely fascinating why</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.780" end="00:46:04.109" style="s2">when I say something and you and you and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.140" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">you let me know that you understand what</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.109" end="00:46:12.200" style="s2">I just heard how I know he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:12.200" style="s2">thought I know because I go like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.180" end="00:46:19.410" style="s2">what is that and I think that has</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.549" end="00:46:23.849" style="s2">something to do with the the word like</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.410" end="00:46:27.660" style="s2">oh I get that like I get that you get</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.849" end="00:46:30.390" style="s2">that I make sense and I make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.660" end="00:46:34.230" style="s2">you right because I make sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.390" end="00:46:37.859" style="s2">then that validates my own way of making</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.230" end="00:46:39.630" style="s2">sense to myself and that&#39;s that term</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.859" end="00:46:41.910" style="s2">making sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.630" end="00:46:43.470" style="s2">right cuz usually think about making</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.910" end="00:46:45.420" style="s2">sense as I think about like I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.470" end="00:46:47.790" style="s2">to figure something out mentally and</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.420" end="00:46:51.000" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the way that it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.790" end="00:46:56.270" style="s2">happening but the moment I get it it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.000" end="00:46:59.819" style="s2">drops into a sensation making sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.270" end="00:47:01.990" style="s2">sensation wow that&#39;s a I like that one</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.819" end="00:47:04.390" style="s2">that&#39;s I like that form</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.990" end="00:47:08.410" style="s2">low case thought about the other day</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.390" end="00:47:10.350" style="s2">nice nice um so just to repeat what you</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.410" end="00:47:13.660" style="s2">said because this is also what I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.350" end="00:47:15.190" style="s2">highlighting in this quote is getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.660" end="00:47:17.320" style="s2">the others intentional stance</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.190" end="00:47:19.750" style="s2">well first you listen for how it makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.320" end="00:47:22.570" style="s2">sense and then you&#39;re getting there</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.750" end="00:47:25.510" style="s2">intentional stance it equals</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.570" end="00:47:27.070" style="s2">understanding it equals a feeling I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.510" end="00:47:28.750" style="s2">like you&#39;re saying it they don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.070" end="00:47:30.490" style="s2">follow each other but that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.750" end="00:47:33.610" style="s2">aiming for encircling we&#39;re finding ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.490" end="00:47:35.740" style="s2">and one way it works is because I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.610" end="00:47:37.660" style="s2">we have multiple people in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.740" end="00:47:40.570" style="s2">reflecting different things and so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.660" end="00:47:42.730" style="s2">often not see a lot of things and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.570" end="00:47:45.220" style="s2">somebody will say something that I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.730" end="00:47:47.650" style="s2">love how they where did they get that</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.220" end="00:47:49.000" style="s2">from but then I&#39;m able to see you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.650" end="00:47:51.369" style="s2">it&#39;s just we keep waking each other up</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.000" end="00:47:54.760" style="s2">as a group it&#39;s not just again that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.369" end="00:47:57.850" style="s2">one-to-one relationship a therapist and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.760" end="00:47:59.740" style="s2">client which is and I&#39;m not putting it</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.850" end="00:48:01.060" style="s2">down I&#39;m just wanting to say that these</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.740" end="00:48:02.680" style="s2">you know because there&#39;s a lot you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.060" end="00:48:07.390" style="s2">get encircling that you can get in</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.680" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">therapy let&#39;s just say that so but when</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.390" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">we get the understanding the acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:13.630" style="s2">then the phrase here is increased</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:15.609" style="s2">confidence like you&#39;re saying that our</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.630" end="00:48:18.930" style="s2">experiences are safely contained in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.609" end="00:48:23.230" style="s2">new attachment relationship and again my</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.930" end="00:48:25.510" style="s2">query is is that phrase is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.230" end="00:48:28.810" style="s2">happening as a surrogate attachment</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.510" end="00:48:30.760" style="s2">relationship in the field so so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.810" end="00:48:34.330" style="s2">looking for all the ways that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.760" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to force the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.330" end="00:48:38.859" style="s2">theory I want it to be illuminated and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:41.320" style="s2">think that will happen by people</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.859" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">responding and if there&#39;s concerns or</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.320" end="00:48:47.070" style="s2">doubts or questions you know that we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:49.900" style="s2">as a community yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.070" end="00:48:53.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something here this this thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.900" end="00:48:55.720" style="s2">about like making sense to well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.160" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">you know one of the things that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.720" end="00:49:00.550" style="s2">in teaching people how to circle right</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:03.340" style="s2">you know a lot of it is actually you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.550" end="00:49:05.020" style="s2">know opening up it one to circle you bet</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.340" end="00:49:07.840" style="s2">you have to do with your whole be right</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.020" end="00:49:09.850" style="s2">if you have a relationship it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.840" end="00:49:15.190" style="s2">really done with the whole being right</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.850" end="00:49:15.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s this landings over the years</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.190" end="00:49:19.240" style="s2">that his</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.990" end="00:49:21.039" style="s2">articulated out of circling cuz that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.240" end="00:49:22.180" style="s2">how that&#39;s how circling has come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.039" end="00:49:23.789" style="s2">being as I think I was like good</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.180" end="00:49:27.309" style="s2">therapies coming in to be anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.789" end="00:49:31.299" style="s2">anything involving you know knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.309" end="00:49:35.289" style="s2">that becomes words and then reiterated</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.299" end="00:49:37.720" style="s2">in practice and like a thing at first it</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.289" end="00:49:39.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t arise in the mind does an idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.720" end="00:49:43.809" style="s2">or a theory either then somebody creates</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.730" end="00:49:46.960" style="s2">a method no it&#39;s enacted in the body and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.809" end="00:49:50.259" style="s2">acted out to first right it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:53.589" style="s2">was a knowledge that was lived from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.259" end="00:49:55.180" style="s2">bottom up in your behavior first and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.589" end="00:49:57.690" style="s2">that&#39;s so important I think what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.180" end="00:50:01.299" style="s2">he&#39;s talking a lot about is that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.690" end="00:50:02.980" style="s2">that so much of the base level of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.299" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">relationship has to do with actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.980" end="00:50:09.220" style="s2">you&#39;re more like your ear um your your</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:11.079" style="s2">motor sister sensory motor sis yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.220" end="00:50:13.240" style="s2">race to this so for example right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.079" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">with you and I you&#39;re shaking your head</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.240" end="00:50:19.180" style="s2">yes just in there smiling in recognition</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:22.329" style="s2">and I&#39;m smiling in and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.180" end="00:50:26.170" style="s2">whole level of this very intricate</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.329" end="00:50:27.970" style="s2">subtle coordinated thing going on that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.170" end="00:50:29.380" style="s2">if all of a sudden I were just to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.970" end="00:50:34.019" style="s2">like I&#39;m talking to you and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.380" end="00:50:37.059" style="s2">sudden I were to be like like um right</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.019" end="00:50:40.089" style="s2">or if I laughed at the wrong time or I</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.059" end="00:50:43.829" style="s2">or I went outside of the range of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.089" end="00:50:47.109" style="s2">dance it would be like something broke</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.829" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have the attunement yes we lose</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.109" end="00:50:50.799" style="s2">a tournament so kuehnemund</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:53.500" style="s2">has a lot to do with coordination</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.799" end="00:50:58.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to do with joining in it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.500" end="00:51:02.319" style="s2">like like in a dirted Rena that feeling</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.359" end="00:51:05.230" style="s2">into at a bodily level yes well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.319" end="00:51:07.269" style="s2">yeah you want to and so it so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.230" end="00:51:10.059" style="s2">you know as we learn how to do circling</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.269" end="00:51:12.099" style="s2">and we started to understand well when</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.059" end="00:51:14.470" style="s2">people have these epic moments of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.099" end="00:51:16.839" style="s2">feeling deeply gotten what are how does</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.470" end="00:51:19.960" style="s2">that happen and one of the big reasons</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.839" end="00:51:24.819" style="s2">that that happen is we&#39;ve teased out is</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.960" end="00:51:27.549" style="s2">like actually that one is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.819" end="00:51:29.170" style="s2">in a Heidegger and in the existential</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.549" end="00:51:29.650" style="s2">phenomenologist talked a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.170" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.650" end="00:51:33.490" style="s2">you could say that you could almost say</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:35.859" style="s2">that the human being is that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.490" end="00:51:39.910" style="s2">cosmos that makes sense of the cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.859" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">mm-hmm it&#39;s the most vulnerable self</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.910" end="00:51:46.660" style="s2">transparent to itself opening such that</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:50.500" style="s2">it makes sense of its world we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.660" end="00:51:53.319" style="s2">almost indistinguishable from a sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.500" end="00:51:56.260" style="s2">making and so another way of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.319" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">is my experience always makes sense in</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.260" end="00:52:03.460" style="s2">other words as an internal logic to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:05.289" style="s2">and so when you make sense to me what</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.460" end="00:52:07.720" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is that when you make sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.289" end="00:52:09.430" style="s2">to me it means that I&#39;m and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.720" end="00:52:12.700" style="s2">demonstrate that you make sense you may</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.430" end="00:52:15.640" style="s2">show it to you like I let you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.700" end="00:52:19.210" style="s2">actually letting you know is that like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.640" end="00:52:21.730" style="s2">see the logic or the logos of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.210" end="00:52:23.260" style="s2">experience how you make sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.730" end="00:52:26.260" style="s2">world it&#39;s valid</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.260" end="00:52:29.529" style="s2">it&#39;s called validity right so when when</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.260" end="00:52:31.109" style="s2">when I validate what I when I validate</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.529" end="00:52:34.150" style="s2">you what I&#39;m really saying is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.109" end="00:52:37.029" style="s2">validating the logic upon which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.150" end="00:52:38.890" style="s2">experiencing folds and I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.029" end="00:52:40.569" style="s2">and of course that makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.890" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">because if this is important to you and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.569" end="00:52:45.069" style="s2">then they said this of course that how</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:47.319" style="s2">are you gonna feel of course you course</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.069" end="00:52:51.940" style="s2">you feel that way fact I feel that way</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.319" end="00:52:54.339" style="s2">just listening to you and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.940" end="00:52:57.130" style="s2">free a term called cross modal</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.339" end="00:52:59.940" style="s2">responsiveness I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.130" end="00:53:03.880" style="s2">parent that&#39;s the sexy Freight crap</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.940" end="00:53:11.770" style="s2">responsible use that everybody use it on</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.880" end="00:53:15.430" style="s2">your first day well it&#39;s in what I hear</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.770" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">you saying and and it&#39;s it contributes</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.430" end="00:53:20.859" style="s2">to this Bray&#39;s feeling felt which they</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">which is referenced in the book this</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.859" end="00:53:25.750" style="s2">idea of feeling felt that we often use</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:28.150" style="s2">that phrase in circling but cross modal</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.750" end="00:53:31.869" style="s2">responsiveness is in the between the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.150" end="00:53:35.279" style="s2">parent and the child where the parent</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.869" end="00:53:37.299" style="s2">responds let&#39;s see what pages is on</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.279" end="00:53:40.900" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t write down the page for</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.299" end="00:53:43.870" style="s2">this one sorry but the parent responds</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.900" end="00:53:47.710" style="s2">in a different sensory register</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.870" end="00:53:50.320" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a response to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.710" end="00:53:51.880" style="s2">emotional experience but it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.320" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">something that the way it shareable is</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.880" end="00:53:57.010" style="s2">you&#39;re not mimicking what a person is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:59.140" style="s2">doing like you&#39;re describing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.010" end="00:54:02.440" style="s2">feeling it in yourself and you respond</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.140" end="00:54:04.240" style="s2">as you would respond to that person and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.440" end="00:54:07.000" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s a share that&#39;s there where</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:08.410" style="s2">something shared yeah they give an</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.000" end="00:54:10.150" style="s2">example of the child squeeze</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.410" end="00:54:13.720" style="s2">squeals with joy and her mother&#39;s body</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.150" end="00:54:15.850" style="s2">answers with a response of shimmy and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.720" end="00:54:18.190" style="s2">says he says it allows the child to feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.850" end="00:54:21.970" style="s2">known and without it she may only feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.190" end="00:54:24.460" style="s2">imitated and so the idea here that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.970" end="00:54:29.430" style="s2">will get into as we just go along I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.460" end="00:54:29.430" style="s2">gonna try to let go of it so much into</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.390" end="00:54:35.890" style="s2">really that strikes me right there so</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.030" end="00:54:39.430" style="s2">like you said something and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.890" end="00:54:43.120" style="s2">struck right now you should go lucky</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.430" end="00:54:47.320" style="s2">she&#39;s a bit we can go you should go yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.120" end="00:54:49.720" style="s2">I feel and then I feel mimicked by you</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.320" end="00:54:53.470" style="s2">but I don&#39;t feel responded to by you</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.720" end="00:54:55.960" style="s2">right so this difference between being</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.470" end="00:54:58.930" style="s2">feeling mimicked or being mimicked and</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.960" end="00:55:01.660" style="s2">being responded to what I&#39;m hearing you</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.930" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">say is it has to do with when I mimic</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.660" end="00:55:07.960" style="s2">you I&#39;m not really including myself yes</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:12.150" style="s2">it&#39;s when I respond to you is when I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.960" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">have my own genuine spontaneous response</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.150" end="00:55:19.060" style="s2">directly to you which means implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:22.170" style="s2">seems like I had skin in the game you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.060" end="00:55:25.330" style="s2">see me implicitly in my unique response</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.170" end="00:55:27.640" style="s2">right to your unique response and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.330" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">would imagine that one on a base level</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.640" end="00:55:32.320" style="s2">it it&#39;s a confirming way to response I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:34.780" style="s2">basically saying that like your</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.320" end="00:55:38.200" style="s2">communication to me was legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.780" end="00:55:40.680" style="s2">enough for me to elicit myself being</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.200" end="00:55:40.680" style="s2">affected</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:45.430" style="s2">I think that&#39;s really important and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.630" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">for me it&#39;s an edge encircling take you</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.430" end="00:56:01.060" style="s2">just responded to that you felt my cross</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:56:04.470" style="s2">modeled with you yeah and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.060" end="00:56:08.620" style="s2">share that that&#39;s just something</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.470" end="00:56:10.930" style="s2">encircling that is an edge for me that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.620" end="00:56:13.450" style="s2">wish I could practice more you know that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.930" end="00:56:16.350" style="s2">I want to practice more waking up direct</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.450" end="00:56:21.180" style="s2">responsiveness letting it be more varied</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.350" end="00:56:24.280" style="s2">right more from more depth more richness</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.180" end="00:56:26.080" style="s2">not just a habitual way of responding to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.280" end="00:56:27.930" style="s2">somebody like okay here I&#39;m showing you</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.080" end="00:56:30.190" style="s2">some compassion or here I&#39;m showing you</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.930" end="00:56:33.090" style="s2">you know I&#39;m res Here I am resonating</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.190" end="00:56:35.820" style="s2">with you but how do you actually access</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.090" end="00:56:37.600" style="s2">those shared response like you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.820" end="00:56:38.500" style="s2">okay I see you kind of a personal</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.600" end="00:56:43.270" style="s2">question about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.500" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">sure yeah so does it so basically what</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.270" end="00:56:46.390" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is is that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:47.770" style="s2">things that you notice that like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.390" end="00:56:52.690" style="s2">edge for you and that you want to like</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.770" end="00:56:54.460" style="s2">owning more on is is is registering more</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.690" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">of a sense of responsiveness to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.460" end="00:57:00.580" style="s2">other in your in your sessions and with</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:02.860" style="s2">people that whatever you say yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.580" end="00:57:05.350" style="s2">I would be surprised if my clients said</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.860" end="00:57:09.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t already do that you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.350" end="00:57:12.940" style="s2">I think in my work I do it and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.880" end="00:57:17.950" style="s2">good enough I would say but but yet I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.940" end="00:57:20.380" style="s2">aware that personally yeah in fact I can</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.950" end="00:57:22.810" style="s2">put it this way that in my work a</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.380" end="00:57:25.330" style="s2">certain field is developed I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.810" end="00:57:28.420" style="s2">role something really opens and comes</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.330" end="00:57:30.250" style="s2">alive for me you know similar to these</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.420" end="00:57:32.350" style="s2">videos you know where I&#39;m really focused</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.250" end="00:57:34.590" style="s2">on you what we&#39;re talking about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.350" end="00:57:40.290" style="s2">feeling a lot as we&#39;re talking yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.590" end="00:57:42.610" style="s2">other times when I&#39;m not in the role</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.290" end="00:57:46.870" style="s2">that&#39;s where something can get more</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.610" end="00:57:49.750" style="s2">quiet and maybe a little distant you</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.870" end="00:57:52.300" style="s2">know and so I&#39;m interested in catching</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.750" end="00:57:54.130" style="s2">these that kind of natural response and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.300" end="00:57:56.890" style="s2">growing it</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.130" end="00:57:58.390" style="s2">right that makes sense yeah it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.890" end="00:58:02.979" style="s2">make sense anything I&#39;m curious about</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.390" end="00:58:04.930" style="s2">does that make sense to you that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.979" end="00:58:06.369" style="s2">there&#39;s ways in which you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.930" end="00:58:07.960" style="s2">more responsive that you don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.369" end="00:58:10.930" style="s2">have access to and then you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.960" end="00:58:13.269" style="s2">on like is that does that Conte is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.930" end="00:58:15.849" style="s2">does that link back for you like with</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.269" end="00:58:18.130" style="s2">your mom or your family or like does</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.849" end="00:58:19.630" style="s2">that make sense that that would be well</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.130" end="00:58:24.940" style="s2">I think you know the answers to that but</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.630" end="00:58:28.269" style="s2">yes yes you know all about my mom and my</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.940" end="00:58:30.940" style="s2">family and you know I I appreciate you</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.269" end="00:58:33.700" style="s2">asking that because it&#39;s you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.940" end="00:58:37.229" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s appropriate to bring</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.700" end="00:58:40.900" style="s2">specific personal examples into these</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.229" end="00:58:43.479" style="s2">explorations and so I think that there</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.900" end="00:58:45.940" style="s2">has become you know I think I actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.479" end="00:58:48.460" style="s2">think I was more anxious when I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.940" end="00:58:50.950" style="s2">younger but I&#39;m curious but I perceive</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.460" end="00:58:54.910" style="s2">myself as having got has I became more</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.950" end="00:58:56.680" style="s2">avoidant in some ways and so when when I</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.910" end="00:58:59.739" style="s2">started studying this I caught that and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.680" end="00:59:03.489" style="s2">I started to see how can I I learned</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.739" end="00:59:06.940" style="s2">that avoidant attachment is has to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.489" end="00:59:10.299" style="s2">with the suppression of feeling and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.940" end="00:59:12.700" style="s2">know on a regular basis and in real in</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.299" end="00:59:14.319" style="s2">within intimacy the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.700" end="00:59:16.299" style="s2">avoidant lis attached conceal all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:17.979" style="s2">of feelings by themself or with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.299" end="00:59:20.039" style="s2">that there&#39;s no skin in the game like</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.979" end="00:59:21.670" style="s2">you&#39;re saying yeah and this might be</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.039" end="00:59:25.140" style="s2">generalizing but I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.670" end="00:59:29.259" style="s2">important way to just to consider it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.140" end="00:59:32.049" style="s2">what happens when you&#39;re just meeting</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.259" end="00:59:35.859" style="s2">another human being and what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.049" end="00:59:38.589" style="s2">natural response without trying totally</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.859" end="00:59:39.880" style="s2">like see I think that&#39;s so important I</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.589" end="00:59:45.880" style="s2">because I&#39;ve just watched this</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.880" end="00:59:53.109" style="s2">encircling that there&#39;s so you know just</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.880" end="00:59:56.259" style="s2">watching how deeply self-regulating when</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.109" end="00:59:58.779" style="s2">people share and they look up and they</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.259" end="01:00:01.809" style="s2">see a bunch of people coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.779" end="01:00:05.190" style="s2">movements in direct response to their</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.809" end="01:00:06.900" style="s2">utterance right you could see this</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.190" end="01:00:09.690" style="s2">warmth in</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.900" end="01:00:13.230" style="s2">this kind of human feeling just come</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.690" end="01:00:16.950" style="s2">over them as they as that coordination</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.230" end="01:00:20.490" style="s2">happens right and so I would imagine</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.950" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">that like if it&#39;s so confirming right</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.490" end="01:00:25.380" style="s2">it&#39;s so confirming Morris Berman has</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:29.609" style="s2">this this notion about that he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.380" end="01:00:34.130" style="s2">that the disconnection from our somatic</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.609" end="01:00:37.529" style="s2">being has to do with these experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.130" end="01:00:41.339" style="s2">extreme versions and or chronic versions</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.529" end="01:00:44.819" style="s2">of what he would kit would say is a dis</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.339" end="01:00:46.859" style="s2">come for me disconfirming ways of being</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.819" end="01:00:48.960" style="s2">responded to yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.859" end="01:00:51.180" style="s2">exactly because if you think about it</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.960" end="01:00:54.750" style="s2">when you when you elicit a communication</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.180" end="01:00:57.750" style="s2">it arises from the legitimacy of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.750" end="01:01:01.349" style="s2">little self legitimacy of your</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.750" end="01:01:04.349" style="s2">personhood and so somebody like hears</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.349" end="01:01:07.049" style="s2">you but then doesn&#39;t respond to anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.349" end="01:01:08.940" style="s2">that you said and kind of veers off at a</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.049" end="01:01:11.130" style="s2">glance right so if you&#39;re like mom I</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.940" end="01:01:13.619" style="s2">need I&#39;m hungry and she goes like look</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.130" end="01:01:16.710" style="s2">at the pink flowers over there that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.619" end="01:01:18.990" style="s2">gonna do that right in that moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.710" end="01:01:20.579" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of break and I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.990" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve all experienced this this is kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.579" end="01:01:25.680" style="s2">of there&#39;s this weird awkward break</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:29.369" style="s2">right that kind of you could say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.680" end="01:01:32.010" style="s2">creates a schism between the self in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.369" end="01:01:34.980" style="s2">other yes and in that moment right</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.010" end="01:01:37.230" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of like um who&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.980" end="01:01:39.390" style="s2">calls he calls it the basic fault right</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.230" end="01:01:42.059" style="s2">this schism between the self and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.390" end="01:01:44.940" style="s2">other where what ends up happening is</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.059" end="01:01:49.049" style="s2">that you lose grounding and in the in</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.940" end="01:01:53.549" style="s2">the somatic flow in feeling of being a</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.049" end="01:01:55.710" style="s2">body and you rise up and you become you</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.549" end="01:01:59.789" style="s2">start to identify yourself as an other</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.710" end="01:02:02.190" style="s2">for others right which is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.789" end="01:02:04.109" style="s2">heal the fault line or the schism</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.190" end="01:02:05.809" style="s2">between this element like how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.109" end="01:02:09.029" style="s2">saying that and I felt really sad</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.809" end="01:02:11.250" style="s2">feeling into that imagining myself or</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.029" end="01:02:14.430" style="s2">anyone else having that experience where</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.250" end="01:02:16.440" style="s2">you have to associate from your body</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.430" end="01:02:18.779" style="s2">self the flow of experience become a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.440" end="01:02:20.500" style="s2">self for others but I like that phrase</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.779" end="01:02:22.870" style="s2">he&#39;ll default</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.500" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">this isn&#39;t yeah and he says that to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.870" end="01:02:26.770" style="s2">degree that yourself is Wow I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:29.650" style="s2">whoa - just took that in another level</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.770" end="01:02:32.170" style="s2">okay I mean it just it sort of just</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.650" end="01:02:37.810" style="s2">keeps coming through me and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.170" end="01:02:39.610" style="s2">listening right there stop the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.810" end="01:02:41.830" style="s2">person from talking to say I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.610" end="01:02:44.320" style="s2">taking it in it&#39;s still wait it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.830" end="01:02:46.270" style="s2">affecting me see I feel really heard</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.320" end="01:02:49.650" style="s2">I feel really connected to you and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.270" end="01:02:51.910" style="s2">feel like a sense of expansion or</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.650" end="01:02:54.520" style="s2">inspiration or excitement feels really</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.910" end="01:02:57.820" style="s2">alive and I just wish that our whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.520" end="01:03:00.430" style="s2">world could learn that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.820" end="01:03:02.500" style="s2">about listening and holding space and</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.430" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">not including ourselves that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.500" end="01:03:08.290" style="s2">I just love having learned in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.680" end="01:03:11.470" style="s2">community here is that each of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.290" end="01:03:13.570" style="s2">experience matters when I&#39;m talking if</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.470" end="01:03:15.400" style="s2">I&#39;m being circled your experience</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.570" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">matters what&#39;s happening over there</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.400" end="01:03:21.700" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s so dynamic you know right</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:24.550" style="s2">and it will just deepen that just a</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.700" end="01:03:28.150" style="s2">little bit and complete that loop you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.550" end="01:03:32.530" style="s2">know I think that that what would burrow</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.150" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">say would be something like so we we</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.530" end="01:03:38.410" style="s2">lose connection with their somatic</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:40.810" style="s2">grounding of being a body and we in</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.410" end="01:03:44.860" style="s2">those weird awkward disconfirming</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.810" end="01:03:47.590" style="s2">responses we kind of like break from it</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.860" end="01:03:51.010" style="s2">and then start to become an other for</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.590" end="01:03:52.840" style="s2">others right it could be you could use</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.010" end="01:03:56.020" style="s2">that word fawning right where somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.840" end="01:03:57.700" style="s2">just yeah just paying a tenth like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.020" end="01:04:00.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a hovering or smothering but</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.700" end="01:04:02.890" style="s2">instead when both people&#39;s experiences</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.730" end="01:04:04.600" style="s2">matter you know when somebody could say</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.890" end="01:04:06.670" style="s2">you know I love what you&#39;re saying but</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.600" end="01:04:08.800" style="s2">I&#39;m getting tired I just need to pause</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.670" end="01:04:09.340" style="s2">for nobody can ever say that when does</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.800" end="01:04:11.830" style="s2">that happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.340" end="01:04:16.450" style="s2">can we pause for a moment and just be</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.830" end="01:04:18.070" style="s2">here I mean and there&#39;s I think that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.450" end="01:04:21.070" style="s2">think you brilliantly just brought it</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.070" end="01:04:24.060" style="s2">back to what he would say that he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.070" end="01:04:28.240" style="s2">okay if you want to know to what degree</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.060" end="01:04:32.440" style="s2">that yourself has been confiscated this</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.240" end="01:04:32.990" style="s2">is this is I you know is to what degree</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.440" end="01:04:35.300" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.990" end="01:04:41.690" style="s2">comfortable being in the presence of</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.300" end="01:04:43.820" style="s2">other people and being in silence beer</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.690" end="01:04:45.830" style="s2">Morris Berman would say any wrote I</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.820" end="01:04:47.510" style="s2">think this has come from the book coming</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.830" end="01:04:49.480" style="s2">to her since it&#39;s by Morris permit the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.510" end="01:04:51.920" style="s2">brilliant book brilliant book about this</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.480" end="01:04:56.290" style="s2">we I think what he would say would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:58.490" style="s2">that to the degree that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.290" end="01:05:01.640" style="s2">comfortable in silence</p>

<p begin="01:05:13.220" end="01:05:21.380" style="s2">what&#39;s circling invites for both of</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.520" end="01:05:24.920" style="s2">these attachment styles is for the</p>

<p begin="01:05:24.920" end="01:05:33.410" style="s2">idea is under stress that the attention</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:35.930" style="s2">goes more to the other and so circling</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.410" end="01:05:38.590" style="s2">invites the preoccupied to feel</p>

<p begin="01:05:51.650" end="01:05:57.230" style="s2">know I mean that might be extreme but</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.520" end="01:06:03.290" style="s2">the avoidant Lee attached can sit back</p>

<p begin="01:06:18.619" end="01:06:24.350" style="s2">over to this side and you know do</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.290" end="01:06:27.050" style="s2">different things that start to shift</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.350" end="01:06:30.910" style="s2">that start to get through in some way I</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.050" end="01:06:35.600" style="s2">imagine right touches on parts over here</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.910" end="01:06:38.570" style="s2">starts to wake up and engage and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.600" end="01:06:45.470" style="s2">then shift the energy down here oh yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.570" end="01:06:53.840" style="s2">working you need some more of that</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.470" end="01:06:56.390" style="s2">okay good okay so yeah well what if I</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.840" end="01:06:57.800" style="s2">just named these two other parts and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.390" end="01:06:59.570" style="s2">then when we put the video up I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.800" end="01:07:01.910" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna put the quotes and things</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.570" end="01:07:04.400" style="s2">that I wanted to read yes people can</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.910" end="01:07:10.660" style="s2">just read them and then we can go on to</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.400" end="01:07:13.400" style="s2">mentalization next time so hmm</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.660" end="01:07:16.849" style="s2">so feeling felts is an important part</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.400" end="01:07:20.210" style="s2">there&#39;s also something called upgrading</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.849" end="01:07:23.900" style="s2">the dialog and then there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.210" end="01:07:27.070" style="s2">else called scaffolding and when I read</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.900" end="01:07:32.090" style="s2">this part about upgrading the dialog I</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.070" end="01:07:34.010" style="s2">thought that&#39;s inherently what you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.090" end="01:07:40.700" style="s2">been showing me in reflection at least</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.010" end="01:07:43.700" style="s2">all these years I&#39;ve known you the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.700" end="01:07:45.380" style="s2">quote is that Bromberg describes</p>

<p begin="01:07:55.760" end="01:08:00.320" style="s2">the same lines Friedman suggests that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.160" end="01:08:02.180" style="s2">as therapists need to accept our</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.320" end="01:08:05.089" style="s2">patients or fellow circulars on their</p>

<p begin="01:08:05.089" end="01:08:10.150" style="s2">for those terms striking this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:13.390" style="s2">balance requires us to assume that our</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.150" end="01:08:16.029" style="s2">patients fellow circulars are capable of</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.390" end="01:08:18.259" style="s2">somewhat more feeling thoughtfulness</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.029" end="01:08:21.080" style="s2">connection or initiative than they</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.259" end="01:08:24.319" style="s2">believe they are expect too little and</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.080" end="01:08:27.589" style="s2">the patient or circular feel his hopes</p>

<p begin="01:08:30.589" end="01:08:37.370" style="s2">vulnerabilities have gone unrecognized</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.500" end="01:08:39.319" style="s2">and so I think that&#39;s exactly the level</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.370" end="01:08:42.799" style="s2">we&#39;re working at where the depth of</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.319" end="01:08:44.900" style="s2">which we strive to accept what is and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:46.120" style="s2">then yet we&#39;re seeing each we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.900" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">parts of each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.120" end="01:08:52.370" style="s2">that may that we don&#39;t fully see yet you</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:55.779" style="s2">know see you reflect what you&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.370" end="01:08:59.940" style="s2">and you add something to it and I feel</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.779" end="01:09:01.980" style="s2">unexpectedly different you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.940" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">I think that you were doing that in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.980" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">beginning of the video I&#39;d say you were</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:08.370" style="s2">upgrading the dialogue for myself you</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:11.270" style="s2">know where you&#39;re reflecting to me what</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.370" end="01:09:15.449" style="s2">you seen in me in this whole process and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.270" end="01:09:17.699" style="s2">then there&#39;s scaffolding hmm where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.449" end="01:09:20.880" style="s2">trying on the others experience which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.699" end="01:09:22.679" style="s2">what we&#39;re always doing upgrading the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.880" end="01:09:26.250" style="s2">dialogue to higher levels of awareness</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.679" end="01:09:29.429" style="s2">and complexity right requires what</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.250" end="01:09:31.440" style="s2">developmentalists call scaffolding so</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.429" end="01:09:33.239" style="s2">parents for example scaffold their</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.440" end="01:09:35.819" style="s2">child&#39;s emerging capacity for language</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.239" end="01:09:38.339" style="s2">by speaking for her before she acquires</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.819" end="01:09:40.739" style="s2">the word to describe her experience and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.339" end="01:09:45.150" style="s2">later by asking her to use your words</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.739" end="01:09:46.650" style="s2">these two quotes are on page 198 and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.150" end="01:09:48.569" style="s2">think scaffolding is one of your</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.650" end="01:09:52.469" style="s2">specialties and I wanted to know if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.569" end="01:09:55.170" style="s2">knew that phrase or if you see what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.469" end="01:09:57.030" style="s2">saying if you recognize that yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.170" end="01:09:59.250" style="s2">I definitely recognize what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.030" end="01:10:02.699" style="s2">talking about scaffolding do you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.250" end="01:10:05.909" style="s2">why why that metaphor is you scaffolding</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.699" end="01:10:09.690" style="s2">is it so sometimes you speak for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.909" end="01:10:11.969" style="s2">other it&#39;s again on 1 198 and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.690" end="01:10:17.460" style="s2">articulating the unarticulated and</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.969" end="01:10:18.150" style="s2">unrecognized feelings and some to other</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.460" end="01:10:20.820" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.150" end="01:10:23.880" style="s2">receptive silence is called for to make</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.820" end="01:10:27.870" style="s2">room for the person the patient circular</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.880" end="01:10:29.489" style="s2">to feel or feel more deeply and at</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.870" end="01:10:32.400" style="s2">certain moments we may need to bridge</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.489" end="01:10:34.409" style="s2">the dialogue to a more emotional level</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.400" end="01:10:37.620" style="s2">by going first and expressing our own</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.409" end="01:10:42.210" style="s2">feelings so yeah this has happened where</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.620" end="01:10:44.310" style="s2">you&#39;ll start to say something if I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.210" end="01:10:47.070" style="s2">know at an impasse you&#39;ll start to talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.310" end="01:10:50.219" style="s2">and it&#39;ll wake something up in me well</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.070" end="01:10:53.670" style="s2">the wind is coming speaking of waking</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.219" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">you up yes I think I do get what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.670" end="01:11:01.300" style="s2">saying in the sense of of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:03.550" style="s2">there is in listening to you one of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.300" end="01:11:07.600" style="s2">things I&#39;ve been because we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.550" end="01:11:10.060" style="s2">Explorer weekend coming up all right</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.600" end="01:11:12.010" style="s2">it it&#39;s all about attunement this one</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.060" end="01:11:14.470" style="s2">this particular was all about deep</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.010" end="01:11:17.950" style="s2">attunements and like things like deeply</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.470" end="01:11:20.140" style="s2">listening and really kind of getting</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.950" end="01:11:23.560" style="s2">that all the way into our own being and</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.140" end="01:11:27.480" style="s2">practicing that developing that part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.560" end="01:11:27.480" style="s2">ourselves and</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.719" end="01:11:36.369" style="s2">there is it&#39;s so it&#39;s so interesting how</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.349" end="01:11:39.010" style="s2">deep this one goes right like when I</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.369" end="01:11:41.409" style="s2">listen with my whole being it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.010" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">thing that struck me is that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.409" end="01:11:45.729" style="s2">problem the problem with being a</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:48.039" style="s2">speaking being is I only have one mouth</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.729" end="01:11:50.530" style="s2">you know I have two years I have two</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.039" end="01:11:52.269" style="s2">eyes you know I do everything but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.530" end="01:11:54.550" style="s2">have one mouth that&#39;s such a bummer I</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.269" end="01:11:57.369" style="s2">think I&#39;ve never heard anybody say that</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.550" end="01:11:58.900" style="s2">I don&#39;t think cuz I have one mouth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.369" end="01:12:00.820" style="s2">makes speaking fundamentally really</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.900" end="01:12:02.769" style="s2">different than listening cuz like when I</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.820" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">speak I can only speak one word at a</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.769" end="01:12:10.989" style="s2">time one sentence at a time or that I</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:12.940" style="s2">get scattered so listening is not linear</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.989" end="01:12:14.949" style="s2">it&#39;s holographic well I see everything</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.940" end="01:12:16.479" style="s2">in there and that&#39;s why it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.949" end="01:12:19.150" style="s2">and this is why it&#39;s important to really</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.479" end="01:12:21.219" style="s2">educate your listening because the more</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.150" end="01:12:23.019" style="s2">educated your listening is the more</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.219" end="01:12:26.619" style="s2">distinctions that you have the more that</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.019" end="01:12:28.809" style="s2">you can hear right what somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.619" end="01:12:31.269" style="s2">saying because you&#39;re holding all of</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.809" end="01:12:33.699" style="s2">that knowledge or those distinctions at</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.269" end="01:12:36.729" style="s2">once so it&#39;d be a kind of like a thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.699" end="01:12:39.760" style="s2">where you say X Y &amp; Z and what I hear in</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.729" end="01:12:43.479" style="s2">between x and y is a whole other</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.760" end="01:12:45.249" style="s2">alphabet right and it&#39;s not like you</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.479" end="01:12:46.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that&#39;s true you main</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.249" end="01:12:47.229" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that you knew that that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.900" end="01:12:49.659" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.229" end="01:12:51.489" style="s2">um but you could only say what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.659" end="01:12:54.969" style="s2">saying but because I&#39;m attuned to you</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.489" end="01:12:57.670" style="s2">and and if by listening is really like</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.969" end="01:12:59.860" style="s2">really attuned and educated and the more</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.670" end="01:13:04.050" style="s2">distinctions I have the more I can see</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.860" end="01:13:08.199" style="s2">and respond to error phrase or reflect</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.050" end="01:13:10.539" style="s2">right not only what you said but like</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.199" end="01:13:12.789" style="s2">what you didn&#39;t say and what you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.539" end="01:13:15.249" style="s2">know that you didn&#39;t say and that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.789" end="01:13:16.929" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that you knew which in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.249" end="01:13:18.219" style="s2">certain sense is upgrading the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.929" end="01:13:21.610" style="s2">conversation because like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.219" end="01:13:23.469" style="s2">bringing your linear kind of struggle to</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.610" end="01:13:26.289" style="s2">talk about make sense of yourself and it</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.469" end="01:13:31.749" style="s2">it happens inside of a vat of like one</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.289" end="01:13:33.729" style="s2">care right and then and then - I can I</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.749" end="01:13:35.679" style="s2">can receive all of the verbal and</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.729" end="01:13:36.789" style="s2">nonverbal communications and here in</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.679" end="01:13:39.159" style="s2">between the things that you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.789" end="01:13:42.230" style="s2">and then I can bring all that in some</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.159" end="01:13:44.390" style="s2">way back to you and then it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.230" end="01:13:47.630" style="s2">some way it&#39;s more whole what you said</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.390" end="01:13:50.239" style="s2">is like you what what you send out what</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.630" end="01:13:52.010" style="s2">is true comes back to you more hole and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.239" end="01:13:53.540" style="s2">I think that wholeness is felt by like</p>
