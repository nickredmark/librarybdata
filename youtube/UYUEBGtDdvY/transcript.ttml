<p begin="00:02:44.530" end="00:02:48.819" style="s2">past 40 years have been an arrow a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.659" end="00:02:49.989" style="s2">pretty narrow range of sort of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.819" end="00:02:51.900" style="s2">and emotions which have usually been</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.989" end="00:02:54.459" style="s2">tied to the experience of the teenager</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.900" end="00:02:57.190" style="s2">pretty much and there&#39;s this thing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.459" end="00:02:58.659" style="s2">music when people and rap and so like</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.190" end="00:02:59.950" style="s2">all aspects of music people constantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.659" end="00:03:03.010" style="s2">feel there needs to be pretending to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.950" end="00:03:05.319" style="s2">a certain age like that&#39;s the experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:07.870" style="s2">of the 16 to 24 year old and anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.319" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">outside of that is its deemed culturally</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.870" end="00:03:12.459" style="s2">bad or something and this is silly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:15.609" style="s2">this has led some really silly stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.459" end="00:03:17.560" style="s2">it has led to people pretending to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.609" end="00:03:19.959" style="s2">what they&#39;re not and it&#39;s led to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.560" end="00:03:24.099" style="s2">massive part of the human experience not</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.959" end="00:03:25.629" style="s2">being put within music which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.099" end="00:03:28.599" style="s2">damned part of why I did it was because</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.629" end="00:03:30.849" style="s2">uh I was waiting to be wise enough to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.599" end="00:03:32.889" style="s2">make my third album and I wasn&#39;t wise</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.849" end="00:03:34.540" style="s2">enough yet like I hadn&#39;t lived enough of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.889" end="00:03:36.069" style="s2">life I was able to make my first album</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.540" end="00:03:38.109" style="s2">and it&#39;d be perfect and because that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.069" end="00:03:39.549" style="s2">about being a kid and I was able to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.109" end="00:03:40.900" style="s2">my second album and that was perfect</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.549" end="00:03:42.699" style="s2">that was about a person realizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.900" end="00:03:44.109" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer a kid but to make the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.699" end="00:03:45.970" style="s2">album that&#39;s basically about being a man</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.109" end="00:03:48.129" style="s2">of a real and connected like</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.970" end="00:03:50.169" style="s2">fully actualized man I wasn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.129" end="00:03:52.599" style="s2">there yet cuz I hadn&#39;t reached a level</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.169" end="00:03:54.430" style="s2">of experience and wisdom I needed to so</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.599" end="00:03:55.959" style="s2">I started making instrumental music and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.430" end="00:03:58.419" style="s2">sampling people who was smarter and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.959" end="00:04:00.010" style="s2">wiser than me because they&#39;ve been there</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.419" end="00:04:01.659" style="s2">and they built a you know Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.010" end="00:04:02.949" style="s2">spent four years thinking about certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.659" end="00:04:05.049" style="s2">things and therefore he has a good</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.949" end="00:04:06.940" style="s2">understanding of those things there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.049" end="00:04:09.159" style="s2">people out there who know a of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.940" end="00:04:10.479" style="s2">lot of of a lot of stuff but those</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.159" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">experiences hadn&#39;t necessarily been</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.479" end="00:04:15.190" style="s2">putting music before so I put them in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.630" style="s2">music and now people have that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.190" end="00:04:17.799" style="s2">proving very very useful in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.630" end="00:04:19.449" style="s2">lives and I get hundreds of messages</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.799" end="00:04:20.769" style="s2">every day at this point from people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.449" end="00:04:22.870" style="s2">like this has completely changed my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.769" end="00:04:24.039" style="s2">right business of this in the gym or I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.870" end="00:04:25.900" style="s2">listen to this on the way of work I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.039" end="00:04:27.789" style="s2">posed to my father so now he understands</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.900" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">things or I play this to my children so</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.789" end="00:04:29.950" style="s2">they understand things</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">whatever the hell it is it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.950" end="00:04:34.750" style="s2">thing that was missing in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.130" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">because there&#39;s also something about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.750" end="00:04:41.710" style="s2">way the music relaxes the system and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:43.150" style="s2">allows the words to come in yes is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.710" end="00:04:43.660" style="s2">something that&#39;s deliberate or about</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.150" end="00:04:46.660" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.660" end="00:04:48.130" style="s2">yes very deliberate and it&#39;s a constant</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.660" end="00:04:50.350" style="s2">refinement process of getting better I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.130" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">think I&#39;m a lot better at it now then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.350" end="00:04:54.820" style="s2">was when I started and again that all</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:57.190" style="s2">the whole just insists I released three</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.820" end="00:04:59.710" style="s2">things a week so it&#39;s sticking to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.190" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">schedule is very difficult and and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.710" end="00:05:03.580" style="s2">involves a lot of working out systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:05.260" style="s2">and we&#39;re finding ways of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.580" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">faster and more efficient but also just</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.260" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">getting better and it is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:11.850" style="s2">important that this that it works</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">rhythmically and that it works</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.850" end="00:05:16.060" style="s2">unconsciously and there isn&#39;t anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">in there this that kind of sticks out</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.060" end="00:05:20.040" style="s2">and ruins the overall flow effect you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:21.970" style="s2">should be able to listen to it without</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.040" end="00:05:23.380" style="s2">focusing on the words and you should be</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.970" end="00:05:25.570" style="s2">able to listen to it while focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.380" end="00:05:26.919" style="s2">the words mmm and there should be enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.570" end="00:05:29.140" style="s2">of it that&#39;s hooky and catchy like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.919" end="00:05:30.940" style="s2">regular pop song that you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.140" end="00:05:33.220" style="s2">maybe hum along as well or have a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.940" end="00:05:37.150" style="s2">bit that remember but also it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.220" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">have the depth that the subject is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.150" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">coming across properly hmm and you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:43.030" style="s2">take it in at a decent speed what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:45.790" style="s2">biggest challenge with making something</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.030" end="00:05:47.380" style="s2">like is it finding the the words as it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.790" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">finding that the original content I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.380" end="00:05:51.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s doing justice to the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:53.919" style="s2">it and the spirit of it is the tricky</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.760" end="00:05:55.180" style="s2">thing well though the hardest thing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.919" end="00:05:57.250" style="s2">they also he seems to get harder as it</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.110" end="00:08:37.759" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.240" end="00:08:52.670" style="s2">vast crossing these worlds yeah between</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.690" end="00:08:54.680" style="s2">the sort of like a typical in the sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.670" end="00:08:57.769" style="s2">of grounded on full-blown material yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.680" end="00:09:00.079" style="s2">yes yes he&#39;s a scientist yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.769" end="00:09:03.380" style="s2">also it&#39;s sort of like an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.079" end="00:09:05.829" style="s2">the divine and he doesn&#39;t squat yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.380" end="00:09:07.699" style="s2">a lack of scorn for certain concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.829" end="00:09:10.550" style="s2">again this is like we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.699" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">before this sort of swing from them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.550" end="00:09:14.209" style="s2">a hard material back into the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:16.220" style="s2">psychedelic hmm and we&#39;ve kind of gone</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.209" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">through this intense dark political</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.220" end="00:09:20.120" style="s2">period of everyone screaming at each</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:23.329" style="s2">other and wishing death upon each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.120" end="00:09:24.860" style="s2">and flinging around horrible words and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.329" end="00:09:26.060" style="s2">splitting up with their families and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:28.310" style="s2">divorcing their wives and all these</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.060" end="00:09:30.529" style="s2">things over ridiculous ridiculous stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.310" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">but with swinging back and as we swing</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.529" end="00:09:34.820" style="s2">back we swing up and we can look down</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">upon this stuff rather than being sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.820" end="00:09:40.430" style="s2">of down because you think we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:42.620" style="s2">into a new sort of psychedelia time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.430" end="00:09:44.089" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely doing that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.620" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">broken you can see that everywhere are</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.089" end="00:09:47.540" style="s2">people it&#39;s the concepts people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">getting interested in talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.540" end="00:09:51.110" style="s2">drugs that people are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:54.769" style="s2">mention the colors in clothes you saw</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.110" end="00:09:56.690" style="s2">this with Kanye West who&#39;s always on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.769" end="00:09:58.819" style="s2">cutting edge of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.690" end="00:10:00.260" style="s2">and aside from sort of shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.819" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">culture with music he&#39;s been doing it</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.260" end="00:10:03.529" style="s2">with clothes for many years now as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:06.199" style="s2">his previous collection was all this</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.529" end="00:10:07.100" style="s2">dark stuff the joke was like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.199" end="00:10:09.170" style="s2">couldn&#39;t tell if it was a homeless</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.100" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">person or someone wearing $2,000 Yeezy</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.170" end="00:10:15.769" style="s2">jacket but it was just this dark sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:17.569" style="s2">like military ish and his new collection</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.769" end="00:10:19.639" style="s2">is all sort of rainbow stuff it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.569" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">wood stopping sort of like bright colors</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.639" end="00:10:24.260" style="s2">joyfulness sunshine smiles or this type</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">of thing hmm and you see that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.260" end="00:10:27.560" style="s2">thing everywhere as you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:29.060" style="s2">seven years is that does that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.560" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">is it getting fun I wonder whether it</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.060" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">might be getting faster no it stays the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:34.279" style="s2">same but it&#39;s like each time it bangs in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.540" end="00:10:36.500" style="s2">one direction it kind of gets sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.279" end="00:10:37.880" style="s2">heavier hmm so you have like the mini</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.500" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">ones which is seven years then you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.880" end="00:10:41.240" style="s2">like much larger ones which are more</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:43.190" style="s2">like sixty years but haven&#39;t worked out</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.240" end="00:10:45.949" style="s2">exactly what that is but we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.190" end="00:10:49.430" style="s2">back into psychedelia right as of now</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.949" end="00:10:51.649" style="s2">like as it past few months but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.430" end="00:10:53.930" style="s2">going to be way bigger this time because</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.649" end="00:10:54.120" style="s2">of the way things are online and because</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.930" end="00:10:55.710" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.120" end="00:10:57.660" style="s2">all being interconnected and the lessons</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.710" end="00:11:01.140" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned in the past few it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.660" end="00:11:02.700" style="s2">to be a much huger psychedelic explosion</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.140" end="00:11:04.980" style="s2">and because we&#39;re also connected it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.700" end="00:11:08.130" style="s2">going to have permanent effects on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.980" end="00:11:11.970" style="s2">sort of culture at large and the brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:12.930" style="s2">at what you cook this sort of the bay</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.970" end="00:11:14.700" style="s2">thing is when you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.930" end="00:11:16.860" style="s2">company other consciousness is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.700" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">overused word but just look at videos of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.860" end="00:11:21.029" style="s2">people in the 70s versus people now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:22.710" style="s2">a completely different species and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.029" end="00:11:24.810" style="s2">species that&#39;s emerging right now is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.710" end="00:11:27.270" style="s2">completely different one to that which</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.810" end="00:11:28.710" style="s2">we use doing you see most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.270" end="00:11:30.690" style="s2">you see on televisions are at different</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.710" end="00:11:32.490" style="s2">species to the species that&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.690" end="00:11:34.589" style="s2">now and the species that&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.490" end="00:11:36.420" style="s2">these things online and it&#39;s gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:11:36.420" end="00:11:41.640" style="s2">cultures going did you see we did an</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.029" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">interview with Michael Pollan the guy</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.640" end="00:11:46.410" style="s2">food writers just released a book about</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:49.080" style="s2">psychedelics called how to change your</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.410" end="00:11:51.330" style="s2">mind and this is one last week it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.080" end="00:11:52.500" style="s2">about a couple of weeks ago but one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.330" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">the questions I asked him because he</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.500" end="00:11:58.050" style="s2">he&#39;s New York Times best-selling writer</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.170" end="00:11:59.490" style="s2">one of the top hundred writers they like</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.050" end="00:12:01.470" style="s2">the Malcolm Gladwell of food almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.490" end="00:12:03.690" style="s2">right and he&#39;s written of he studied it</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.470" end="00:12:06.029" style="s2">for few years did his own psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.690" end="00:12:08.790" style="s2">trips and has now released a book about</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.029" end="00:12:10.350" style="s2">it and my question to him was is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.790" end="00:12:12.330" style="s2">the most significant moment in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.350" end="00:12:17.010" style="s2">psychedelic Renaissance and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.330" end="00:12:19.740" style="s2">is yes am i I can&#39;t I can&#39;t say who but</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.010" end="00:12:23.010" style="s2">but someone very close to me watched it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.740" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">and immediately said I wanted to try</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.010" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">this and he said in the interview he has</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:30.570" style="s2">a way of writing about things that makes</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:32.250" style="s2">people want to do them yes and this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.570" end="00:12:37.980" style="s2">by far the most significant kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.250" end="00:12:40.950" style="s2">public validation of psychedelics so it</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.980" end="00:12:42.630" style="s2">makes perfect sense of it yeah assume</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.950" end="00:12:45.270" style="s2">it&#39;s literally having everywhere every</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.630" end="00:12:47.240" style="s2">drogon conversations suddenly after six</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.270" end="00:12:51.390" style="s2">years of it being quite like hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.240" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">life stuff material stuff is suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.390" end="00:12:56.040" style="s2">back in that world again it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:57.889" style="s2">people coming on talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.040" end="00:13:00.319" style="s2">treating depression with</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.889" end="00:13:01.639" style="s2">ketamine and psychedelics and stomach is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.319" end="00:13:02.749" style="s2">suddenly this big thing just over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.639" end="00:13:05.709" style="s2">past few weeks I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.749" end="00:13:07.970" style="s2">terence mckenna&#39;s brother was hosting a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.709" end="00:13:10.009" style="s2">psychedelic science conference in Los</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.970" end="00:13:30.559" style="s2">Angeles last Sunday hmm just suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.009" end="00:13:32.600" style="s2">popped up mainstream the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.559" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">with the psychedelics thing is one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:36.049" style="s2">those things that and people always said</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.399" end="00:13:37.790" style="s2">this you know once you do it it changes</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.049" end="00:13:39.619" style="s2">you fundamentally and you suddenly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.790" end="00:13:42.799" style="s2">world aspects of the world were closed</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.619" end="00:13:43.999" style="s2">previously open up yeah and anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.799" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">done it will tell you that and anyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.999" end="00:13:46.699" style="s2">who seems to have any kind of major</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:48.230" style="s2">influence on things on a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.699" end="00:13:50.600" style="s2">level or the cultural level is usually</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.230" end="00:13:52.429" style="s2">had some experience like them so once it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.600" end="00:13:55.220" style="s2">cracks open on the mainstream and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.429" end="00:13:56.809" style="s2">everyone does it that means everyone all</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.220" end="00:13:58.279" style="s2">the stuff all the little corridors and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.809" end="00:13:59.929" style="s2">ideas that the Internet&#39;s opening up in</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.279" end="00:14:01.790" style="s2">people&#39;s minds and once that&#39;s coupled</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.929" end="00:14:04.220" style="s2">with the real life thing as we&#39;ve spoke</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.790" end="00:14:06.110" style="s2">about previously it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.220" end="00:14:07.369" style="s2">for us to move these online discussions</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.110" end="00:14:09.319" style="s2">into the real world and these online</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.369" end="00:14:10.579" style="s2">experiences into the real world and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.319" end="00:14:12.439" style="s2">psychedelic thing I believe is going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.579" end="00:14:14.389" style="s2">be a massive part of that hmm and once</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.439" end="00:14:17.929" style="s2">those doors are opened they cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.389" end="00:14:18.679" style="s2">closed once these Pandora&#39;s what was in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.929" end="00:14:20.360" style="s2">Pandora&#39;s box</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.679" end="00:14:22.579" style="s2">genius once these genies are out these</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.360" end="00:14:23.989" style="s2">lamps and once these Pandora&#39;s boxes are</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.579" end="00:14:26.600" style="s2">open they cannot be undone and the cut</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.989" end="00:14:28.309" style="s2">that&#39;s that says forever shifted on to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.600" end="00:14:29.869" style="s2">the next phase because psychedelics can</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.309" end="00:14:32.149" style="s2">also I think about this the other day</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.869" end="00:14:33.919" style="s2">it&#39;s like you also it also makes people</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.149" end="00:14:35.660" style="s2">very susceptible conspiracy theories it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.919" end="00:14:37.249" style="s2">makes people very susceptible to like</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.660" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">you may stop believing in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.249" end="00:14:40.879" style="s2">traditional story of society but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:43.309" style="s2">become very susceptible to believing all</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.879" end="00:14:45.739" style="s2">kinds of other yes and this happens</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.309" end="00:14:46.999" style="s2">in the previous psychedelic cycle hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.739" end="00:14:50.869" style="s2">and then we went out of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.999" end="00:14:52.850" style="s2">the conspiracy people whose weirdo the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.869" end="00:14:54.529" style="s2">conspiracy thing flipped and CNN San Lee</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.850" end="00:14:55.730" style="s2">became Infowars and vice versa and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.529" end="00:14:59.059" style="s2">weird source and there&#39;s some very</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.730" end="00:15:00.319" style="s2">strange sort of fashion but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.059" end="00:15:01.819" style="s2">kind of have that because people have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.319" end="00:15:03.499" style="s2">be able to tokens who had no idea some</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.819" end="00:15:06.139" style="s2">part of being open to new ideas is also</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.499" end="00:15:07.080" style="s2">you know being open to bad ideas or</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.139" end="00:15:08.490" style="s2">silly ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.080" end="00:15:11.000" style="s2">have you but we&#39;re in this new period of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.490" end="00:15:14.100" style="s2">being open to new ideas but we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.000" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">toolkit now toolkit seems to be in both</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.100" end="00:15:19.050" style="s2">as a word lady anyway we have a better</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:20.580" style="s2">toolkit for dealing with these things</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.050" end="00:15:22.500" style="s2">and because we&#39;re all connected together</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.580" end="00:15:24.149" style="s2">in this in these larger networks and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.500" end="00:15:25.769" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been listening to these</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.149" end="00:15:26.790" style="s2">three our conversations with smart</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.769" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">people hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.790" end="00:15:31.010" style="s2">a lot of the things that we were drawn</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:36.570" style="s2">to in the first phase of the internet</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.010" end="00:15:37.910" style="s2">conspiratorial wise it&#39;s been done so</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.570" end="00:15:40.230" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it again hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.910" end="00:15:41.760" style="s2">so once you&#39;ve gone into that particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.230" end="00:15:42.870" style="s2">little pocket and you&#39;ve looked at all</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.760" end="00:15:44.070" style="s2">those ones and you&#39;ve come out and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.870" end="00:15:45.510" style="s2">you&#39;ve worked out what was real and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.070" end="00:15:47.190" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it&#39;s not that you just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.510" end="00:15:48.779" style="s2">repeat that it means this time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.190" end="00:15:50.190" style="s2">gonna look at sort of bigger ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.779" end="00:15:52.980" style="s2">deeper ideas and we&#39;re gonna go further</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.190" end="00:15:54.329" style="s2">and deeper and there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.980" end="00:15:57.510" style="s2">nonsense in there but there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.329" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">some deep deep amazing truths which will</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.510" end="00:16:05.370" style="s2">help is reach deeper than our pasts and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:07.200" style="s2">go forth to Mars hmm McKenna was talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.370" end="00:16:09.240" style="s2">where you&#39;ll DJ what&#39;s that where I will</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.200" end="00:16:12.510" style="s2">be DJ McKenna was talking about this at</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.240" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">the end of society a society collapses</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.510" end="00:16:15.450" style="s2">or a part of it dies whenever that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.450" end="00:16:21.990" style="s2">the smart people of the time will look</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:24.510" style="s2">into the deep past for uh for something</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.990" end="00:16:26.490" style="s2">valuable to move it forward I think was</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.510" end="00:16:29.010" style="s2">eaten archaic what&#39;s that the okay with</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.490" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">revival yeah he calls it yes and he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.010" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">talking about this in 91 but I think is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:35.970" style="s2">very relevant or hampered Sheldrake who</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:37.170" style="s2">we interviewed as well that&#39;s why we you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.970" end="00:16:40.380" style="s2">know you&#39;re deep in the heart of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.170" end="00:16:42.029" style="s2">little thing yeah that&#39;s where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.380" end="00:16:46.290" style="s2">right now and we have our Council of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.029" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">wise men of which the ID W yeah are a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.290" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">part they&#39;re one of these councils of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:55.160" style="s2">wise men hmm and yeah yeah that&#39;s my my</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.990" end="00:16:57.990" style="s2">sense with the IDW is that it&#39;s an early</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.160" end="00:16:59.850" style="s2">almost like a placeholder for the growth</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.990" end="00:17:02.430" style="s2">of this conversation it&#39;s like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.850" end="00:17:03.930" style="s2">line in the sand of these are people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.430" end="00:17:05.429" style="s2">prepare to speak their truth these are</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.930" end="00:17:07.350" style="s2">people who are not prepared to be kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.429" end="00:17:09.510" style="s2">of shamed by the mainstream media and to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.350" end="00:17:11.970" style="s2">not talking about certain subjects but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.510" end="00:17:13.410" style="s2">think it&#39;s almost like a beachhead that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.970" end="00:17:15.000" style="s2">they&#39;re a minute hill</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.410" end="00:17:17.459" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like a beachhead that then</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:17.730" style="s2">allows a bigger conversation to take</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.459" end="00:17:20.550" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.730" end="00:17:22.380" style="s2">yeah because as we was saying earlier</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.550" end="00:17:23.820" style="s2">a couple of years ago people were</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.380" end="00:17:25.680" style="s2">terrified to talk about certain things</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.820" end="00:17:29.130" style="s2">in public in a way that that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.680" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">as terrified now and I feel that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.130" end="00:17:31.710" style="s2">has shifted massively just over the past</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:33.780" style="s2">few months</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.710" end="00:17:35.250" style="s2">hmm I&#39;m saying this in real life I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.250" end="00:17:38.250" style="s2">the street I&#39;m seeing people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:39.660" style="s2">previously were keeping their mouths</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.250" end="00:17:41.610" style="s2">shut because they were just a bit scared</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.660" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">and we&#39;re in Los Angeles here and by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.610" end="00:17:46.470" style="s2">way which is you know very so consensus</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:47.490" style="s2">people everyone&#39;s terrified of saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.470" end="00:17:49.320" style="s2">the wrong thing because then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.490" end="00:17:50.670" style="s2">lose their representation I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.320" end="00:17:52.440" style="s2">hired to be in movies and things of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.670" end="00:17:55.110" style="s2">nature which happens it happens in a big</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.440" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">way in comics it&#39;s happening in a big</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.110" end="00:17:59.490" style="s2">way it&#39;s happening in everything but</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:03.150" style="s2">people are a lot less scared right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.490" end="00:18:05.880" style="s2">in the summer of 2018 than they were in</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.150" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">a spring 2018 and people are having</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.880" end="00:18:09.510" style="s2">these conversations and people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:11.430" style="s2">openly kind of like mocking people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.510" end="00:18:13.860" style="s2">try and throw some Nancy and things at</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.430" end="00:18:16.620" style="s2">them Medicus for discussing stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.860" end="00:18:18.930" style="s2">now you you mentioned this earlier this</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.620" end="00:18:20.040" style="s2">it&#39;s on British channel 3 and channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.930" end="00:18:23.370" style="s2">or something right there a sketch comedy</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.040" end="00:18:26.310" style="s2">previously mocking this this stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.370" end="00:18:27.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s great mm-hmm and but you</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.310" end="00:18:28.410" style="s2">know that is you said this is just the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.480" end="00:18:31.020" style="s2">beginning is the beginning of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.410" end="00:18:34.820" style="s2">conversations and the bigger ones that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.020" end="00:18:37.580" style="s2">we had as we move into this new glorious</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.820" end="00:18:40.500" style="s2">Eon hmm you seem a lot more optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.580" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">than the last time I suppose you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.500" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">optimistic and also this is the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:47.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like and I think both of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:49.830" style="s2">things are true at the same time you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.910" end="00:18:52.380" style="s2">look at things like Steven Pinker and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.830" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">say look at all of these indices we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.380" end="00:18:56.580" style="s2">more wealthy we have more and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:57.930" style="s2">freedom all this stuff than it is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.580" end="00:18:59.700" style="s2">greatest day to be alive in your history</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.930" end="00:19:01.650" style="s2">and that is absolutely true you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.700" end="00:19:03.930" style="s2">serious look at it it&#39;s amazing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.650" end="00:19:06.810" style="s2">also true that we are so interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.930" end="00:19:08.580" style="s2">our technologies in a certain we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.810" end="00:19:11.460" style="s2">also in a very fragile situation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.580" end="00:19:13.590" style="s2">one particularly like excitable sunspot</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.460" end="00:19:16.410" style="s2">activity would wipe out every hard drive</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.590" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">in it just like that yeah boom but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.410" end="00:19:19.170" style="s2">guess what we would deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:20.760" style="s2">instantly because that&#39;s what we always</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.170" end="00:19:22.800" style="s2">do we&#39;re very very good at that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.760" end="00:19:24.570" style="s2">done very very very quickly I&#39;m I am</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.800" end="00:19:26.130" style="s2">more I am more pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.570" end="00:19:29.160" style="s2">well I&#39;m also optimistic at the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.130" end="00:19:30.870" style="s2">time that some a lot of the thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.160" end="00:19:33.090" style="s2">that I&#39;m following sort of most closely</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.870" end="00:19:34.029" style="s2">like Jordan green hall for example Brett</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.090" end="00:19:37.289" style="s2">Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.029" end="00:19:39.759" style="s2">well I think Eric as well as much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.289" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">much more pessimistic than say Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.759" end="00:19:43.299" style="s2">Peters all of those I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:46.029" style="s2">because they&#39;re talking about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.299" end="00:19:47.889" style="s2">okay we we are in a better situation in</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.029" end="00:19:51.129" style="s2">many ways but we are incredibly fragile</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.889" end="00:19:52.719" style="s2">and we&#39;re so interdependent the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.129" end="00:19:55.090" style="s2">pressures on the system are getting more</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.719" end="00:19:56.259" style="s2">and more and I think all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.090" end="00:19:59.409" style="s2">true at the same time and I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.259" end="00:20:01.690" style="s2">actually we are going to be tested more</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.409" end="00:20:03.759" style="s2">than any but I think we&#39;re going into a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.690" end="00:20:05.830" style="s2">period of like real conflict and real</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.759" end="00:20:07.839" style="s2">chaos but I think we&#39;ll come out ready</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.830" end="00:20:09.399" style="s2">in it yeah we&#39;re all I think it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.839" end="00:20:12.339" style="s2">I think it&#39;s going to increase yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.399" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">exponentially yeah well but we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.339" end="00:20:14.619" style="s2">likely to deal with it than ever we were</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.960" end="00:20:17.249" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.619" end="00:20:21.519" style="s2">yeah and the main thing is you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.249" end="00:20:23.019" style="s2">children the children who did who you</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.519" end="00:20:26.589" style="s2">know we&#39;re at the last generation who</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.019" end="00:20:28.809" style="s2">remember no internet and it&#39;s and after</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.589" end="00:20:30.429" style="s2">that it&#39;s just been Internet and one</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.809" end="00:20:31.839" style="s2">when you&#39;re just Internet when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.429" end="00:20:33.159" style="s2">just a creature of Internet is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.839" end="00:20:35.169" style="s2">completely different mindset and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.159" end="00:20:38.139" style="s2">completely different way of viewing</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.169" end="00:20:41.169" style="s2">everything and those do</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.139" end="00:20:43.479" style="s2">not have the hang-ups that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.169" end="00:20:46.389" style="s2">before them had hmm and they&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.479" end="00:20:49.779" style="s2">better equipped to deal in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.389" end="00:20:51.609" style="s2">speed that&#39;s required and in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.779" end="00:20:52.899" style="s2">flow that&#39;s required a sort of flow</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.609" end="00:20:55.989" style="s2">statements that have been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.899" end="00:20:58.059" style="s2">this whole thing a lot but part of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.989" end="00:21:00.749" style="s2">way I&#39;ve been working in this hyper</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.059" end="00:21:03.519" style="s2">hyper productive ridiculousness has</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.749" end="00:21:05.710" style="s2">taught me super powers in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.519" end="00:21:07.570" style="s2">previously I just sort of like suspected</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.710" end="00:21:09.940" style="s2">but putting it into practice like</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.570" end="00:21:11.229" style="s2">forcing yourself to work every day with</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.940" end="00:21:13.149" style="s2">this incredible tunnel vision and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.229" end="00:21:14.529" style="s2">forcing yourself to rely on instincts</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.149" end="00:21:17.320" style="s2">and forcing yourself to notice every</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.529" end="00:21:18.309" style="s2">synchronicity and to act upon that as if</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.320" end="00:21:19.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a guidepost</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.309" end="00:21:21.159" style="s2">puts you in an incredible flow state</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.779" end="00:21:22.659" style="s2">where everything suddenly becomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.159" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">magical and things just seem to happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.659" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">of their own accord and you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:30.369" style="s2">going and do not stop and do not deviate</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:31.719" style="s2">then it&#39;s it&#39;s just wonderful and insane</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.369" end="00:21:33.399" style="s2">and magical and you get an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.719" end="00:21:36.519" style="s2">done and it&#39;s really good and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.399" end="00:21:40.379" style="s2">increasingly so being in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.519" end="00:21:43.749" style="s2">state internet children a way more</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.379" end="00:21:46.400" style="s2">equipped and ready to exist as that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.749" end="00:21:48.950" style="s2">to accept that as a possible reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">and to do that way more than people</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.950" end="00:21:52.040" style="s2">before them so as we move into this</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:53.510" style="s2">stuff and all these programs arise and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.040" end="00:21:54.920" style="s2">stuff which is way way better equipped</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.510" end="00:21:56.660" style="s2">to deal with them in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.920" end="00:21:58.940" style="s2">generous generations that are rising up</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.660" end="00:22:01.970" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to deal with these things</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.940" end="00:22:05.270" style="s2">one of them I think it was probably when</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.970" end="00:22:07.100" style="s2">I first met you because we connected on</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.270" end="00:22:08.210" style="s2">online on Twitter and you just so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.100" end="00:22:10.309" style="s2">happened to be coming over to the UK</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.210" end="00:22:12.730" style="s2">afterwards and you&#39;ve remix glitch and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.309" end="00:22:15.920" style="s2">the matrix was the first time I realized</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.730" end="00:22:17.870" style="s2">having put put my stuff out there that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.920" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">the internet is a machine for generating</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.870" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">synchronicities yes that&#39;s what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:24.679" style="s2">yeah because because it&#39;s the action</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:26.420" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.679" end="00:22:27.830" style="s2">it becomes don&#39;t even keep doing it you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.420" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">keep moving you have to move with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.830" end="00:22:30.350" style="s2">speed of the Internet the speed of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:32.630" style="s2">incident is different to the speed of</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.630" end="00:22:36.500" style="s2">week in the Internet is like six months</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.040" end="00:22:37.820" style="s2">in so-called real life so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.500" end="00:22:39.530" style="s2">move with the speed of the incident you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.820" end="00:22:41.510" style="s2">have to be like a shark mmm you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.530" end="00:22:43.220" style="s2">keep moving you have to observe</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.510" end="00:22:44.900" style="s2">synchronicities and realize that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.220" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">are signposts for the direction of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.900" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">eating snake you have to eat steak each</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">state honest yeah that&#39;s a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:55.940" style="s2">my success but it&#39;s yeah I&#39;m fueled by</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:57.020" style="s2">stake in meaning stake in meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.940" end="00:22:58.190" style="s2">was the other bit that&#39;s missing is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.020" end="00:22:59.630" style="s2">have to have meaning behind what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.190" end="00:23:01.220" style="s2">doing and then if meaning is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.630" end="00:23:04.190" style="s2">motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.220" end="00:23:06.170" style="s2">synchronicity of the signposts and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.190" end="00:23:10.010" style="s2">just move like a shark you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.170" end="00:23:12.290" style="s2">water a river is beautiful and clean and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.010" end="00:23:14.210" style="s2">amazing as a wonderful thing but when it</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.210" end="00:23:17.870" style="s2">does it come a pond or something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.410" end="00:23:20.030" style="s2">stagnates and horrible things groaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.870" end="00:23:25.580" style="s2">it&#39;s very problematic it must be like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.030" end="00:23:28.820" style="s2">river and you know there&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.580" end="00:23:32.570" style="s2">the natural state of internet generation</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.820" end="00:23:34.520" style="s2">hmm I believe so I don&#39;t think I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.570" end="00:23:37.700" style="s2">that that will counteract a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.520" end="00:23:39.130" style="s2">problems and I think the steam culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.700" end="00:23:42.170" style="s2">idea that Alan Moore used to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.130" end="00:23:47.570" style="s2">that we&#39;re now in we&#39;re in we move from</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.170" end="00:23:50.300" style="s2">the culture of say the amount of time it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.570" end="00:23:53.660" style="s2">took to go from the invention of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.300" end="00:23:55.220" style="s2">stone axe to the Roman Baths then the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.660" end="00:23:57.410" style="s2">amount of time it takes to create the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.220" end="00:23:59.750" style="s2">same amount of stuff is half that and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.410" end="00:24:00.440" style="s2">keeps dividing kind of Moore&#39;s law yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.750" end="00:24:02.090" style="s2">indeed</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.440" end="00:24:03.890" style="s2">like that so you go from a fluid culture</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.090" end="00:24:05.450" style="s2">to a culture where suddenly so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.890" end="00:24:08.360" style="s2">stuff is happening all at once it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.450" end="00:24:10.700" style="s2">steam and we&#39;re in that right now like</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.360" end="00:24:14.140" style="s2">you know thing could be invented in</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.700" end="00:24:17.510" style="s2">three minutes that fixes the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.140" end="00:24:18.680" style="s2">plastic in C or something least nu I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.510" end="00:24:20.360" style="s2">reading about all this stuff every days</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.680" end="00:24:22.040" style="s2">I go someone just worked out to fix that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.360" end="00:24:24.230" style="s2">and someone just worked out to fix that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.040" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">these problems that seemed just</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.230" end="00:24:28.280" style="s2">completely unsurmountable for many many</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:30.080" style="s2">years lots of these things are being</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.280" end="00:24:31.700" style="s2">fixed and will be fixed like very</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:35.270" style="s2">quickly you know and then there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.700" end="00:24:38.120" style="s2">new problems but I think we&#39;re really</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.170" end="00:26:22.309" style="s2">music or whatever is quick to lower down</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.150" end="00:26:26.750" style="s2">on the list of interests and these are</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.320" end="00:26:51.470" style="s2">whatever my my only concern about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.500" end="00:26:55.700" style="s2">generation is it is that they&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.470" end="00:26:57.260" style="s2">up within sort of like a public shaming</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.700" end="00:26:59.870" style="s2">kind of space</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.260" end="00:27:01.580" style="s2">yeah well the cyber yeah the cyber</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.870" end="00:27:05.660" style="s2">bullying and stuff like I&#39;m like I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.580" end="00:27:06.890" style="s2">about what I post on Facebook and there</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.660" end="00:27:07.670" style="s2">are certain things I wouldn&#39;t post on</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.890" end="00:27:08.809" style="s2">there there are certain things like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.670" end="00:27:10.850" style="s2">get pushed back for posting and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.809" end="00:27:12.770" style="s2">pretty disagreeable like I&#39;m prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.850" end="00:27:15.290" style="s2">sort of speak my mind and I can express</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.770" end="00:27:17.450" style="s2">myself fairly well and I think about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.290" end="00:27:19.160" style="s2">generation below and yet even so you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.450" end="00:27:21.650" style="s2">kind of publicly shamed or attacked for</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.160" end="00:27:25.790" style="s2">sharing certain things and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.650" end="00:27:27.290" style="s2">generation below ours like it must be</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.790" end="00:27:29.750" style="s2">really hard to develop your own voice</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.290" end="00:27:31.309" style="s2">because if you say something out of line</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.750" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">that someone can say oh that&#39;s racist or</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.309" end="00:27:36.410" style="s2">sexist this is typically this is a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:38.030" style="s2">blip it&#39;s something we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.410" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">through to get to the other side on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.030" end="00:27:40.970" style="s2">other side because when everyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:42.800" style="s2">realizes oh everyone&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.970" end="00:27:44.960" style="s2">something bad everyone&#39;s got something</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.800" end="00:27:46.340" style="s2">dark about them everyone&#39;s got something</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.960" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">about them that I don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.340" end="00:27:49.790" style="s2">everything that will be the major</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:51.140" style="s2">realization you might take 10 years to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.790" end="00:27:53.470" style="s2">get there or something but when we get</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.140" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">there everyone knows that everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.470" end="00:27:57.320" style="s2">has something about them that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:27:58.309" style="s2">something in their past there&#39;s bad it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.320" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">something about them that you disagree</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.309" end="00:28:01.190" style="s2">with and once everyone gets to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">point okay we&#39;re all the same and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.190" end="00:28:03.590" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a lot of casualties</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:05.540" style="s2">along the way but we&#39;re like I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.590" end="00:28:06.890" style="s2">saying I&#39;m already seeing that whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.540" end="00:28:08.900" style="s2">little thing of people worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.890" end="00:28:10.429" style="s2">what people of having the wrong opinion</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.900" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">and being publicly shamed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.429" end="00:28:14.059" style="s2">lessening and people are getting braver</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:15.559" style="s2">yeah people are getting a lot braver and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.059" end="00:28:18.980" style="s2">they&#39;re realizing they&#39;re not alone</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.559" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">various states sort of shame or the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.980" end="00:28:23.389" style="s2">promise or anguish or what have you so</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:25.370" style="s2">this is a thing that will be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.389" end="00:28:27.830" style="s2">from the other side of it is a much</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.370" end="00:28:28.700" style="s2">freer space something that none of us</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.830" end="00:28:31.669" style="s2">ever had before</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.700" end="00:28:33.049" style="s2">yeah in public to be sort of connected</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.669" end="00:28:35.779" style="s2">to the whole world and be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.049" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">yourself completely hmm in all of its</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.779" end="00:28:40.100" style="s2">horrible and wandering glory and as we</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:42.440" style="s2">were talking about earlier if one sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.100" end="00:28:43.850" style="s2">of mass squeegees everybody then</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.440" end="00:28:46.370" style="s2">suddenly everyone is aware of all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.850" end="00:28:48.919" style="s2">other aspects that are out there of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.370" end="00:28:49.940" style="s2">reality at all times and prospects that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.919" end="00:28:50.539" style="s2">are in here as well which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.940" end="00:28:52.580" style="s2">terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.539" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">yes well again then that takes us back</p>
