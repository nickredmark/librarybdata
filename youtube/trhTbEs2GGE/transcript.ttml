<p begin="00:01:44.789" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">shit was that in the UK it was Channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">UK so what does this glitch say about</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:57.539" style="s2">the state of mainstream media and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:02:00.179" style="s2">culture at large by diagnosis of what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">in a weird way you are villainized in a</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.700" end="00:02:29.370" style="s2">these people are honestly looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.579" end="00:02:30.329" style="s2">your opinions and coming up with these</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.370" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.329" end="00:02:34.709" style="s2">I believe this encounter struck such a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.220" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">nerve because it&#39;s a cultural watershed</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.709" end="00:02:40.440" style="s2">moment it seemed properly as Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:43.579" style="s2">would say it&#39;s archetypal in that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:46.109" style="s2">contains layers and layers of meaning to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.579" end="00:02:48.180" style="s2">go right to the heart of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.109" end="00:02:51.329" style="s2">rift we&#39;re seeing playing out in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.180" end="00:02:54.030" style="s2">culture over the next 50 minutes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.329" end="00:02:56.310" style="s2">gonna do my best to unpack it from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.030" end="00:02:58.519" style="s2">clash between new and old media there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">also why YouTube is gonna kill TV</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.519" end="00:03:06.359" style="s2">because television by its nature all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:09.600" style="s2">these narrow broadcast technologies they</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.359" end="00:03:12.540" style="s2">rely on forcing the story all the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.600" end="00:03:14.549" style="s2">down to the mythological an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:16.350" style="s2">level I thought of ideologies as</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.549" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">fragmentary mythologies that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.350" end="00:03:19.350" style="s2">they get their archetypal and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:21.359" style="s2">psychological power but in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.350" end="00:03:23.639" style="s2">postmodern world and this seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.359" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">something that&#39;s increasingly seeping</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.639" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">out into the culture at large you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">nothing but the tyrannical father</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">nothing but the destructive force of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">masculine consciousness and nothing but</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.510" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">an appalling ideology and it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.030" end="00:03:41.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s sucking the vitality which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:43.340" style="s2">exactly what you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.720" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">symbolically it&#39;s sucking the vitality</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.340" end="00:03:48.590" style="s2">of her culture and to ask how do we move</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:50.870" style="s2">forward constructively rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.590" end="00:03:53.930" style="s2">adding to the polarization I&#39;ve been a</p>

<p begin="00:03:53.930" end="00:03:59.900" style="s2">of the BBC in channel 4 and then making</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.540" end="00:04:02.270" style="s2">documentaries I moved away from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.900" end="00:04:04.880" style="s2">frontline of news some time ago and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.270" end="00:04:06.910" style="s2">started learning psychology which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.880" end="00:04:10.040" style="s2">what first drew me to Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.910" end="00:04:11.780" style="s2">from a distance I&#39;ve started to see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.040" end="00:04:13.070" style="s2">blind spots of the establishment media</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.780" end="00:04:15.500" style="s2">much more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.070" end="00:04:17.900" style="s2">I spent some of the best years of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.500" end="00:04:19.430" style="s2">working life at Channel 4 News and have</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.900" end="00:04:22.850" style="s2">a huge amount of respect and gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.430" end="00:04:24.919" style="s2">to the program but I&#39;m making this film</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.850" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">because I feel so strongly that if we</p>

<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:32.570" style="s2">kind of topics Peterson is raising we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.300" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">in serious trouble my book went up to</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.490" end="00:09:58.030" style="s2">start understanding that the person that</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.019" end="00:13:06.220" style="s2">strongly that neither red nor blue as</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:08.260" style="s2">pure elements contain the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.220" end="00:13:12.790" style="s2">necessary to actually be adaptive to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.260" end="00:13:17.290" style="s2">reality this is a disaster in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:19.449" style="s2">a little bit like separating the hand</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.290" end="00:13:21.160" style="s2">and the eye yeah you&#39;re the eye can see</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.449" end="00:13:22.600" style="s2">if the eye takes itself as being the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.160" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">essence of virtue it separates itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.600" end="00:13:26.529" style="s2">from the ability to do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:27.880" style="s2">with the hand for most of human history</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.529" end="00:13:29.769" style="s2">these groups have actually always</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.880" end="00:13:31.180" style="s2">commingled they&#39;re necessary that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.769" end="00:13:34.779" style="s2">actually relate to each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.180" end="00:13:37.800" style="s2">deeply healthy and direct fashion their</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.779" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">separations and two armed camps is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.800" end="00:13:41.709" style="s2">extinction area actually you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:43.089" style="s2">values of red that you think blue needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.709" end="00:13:45.490" style="s2">to integrate or to make or to</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.089" end="00:13:47.980" style="s2">reintegrate oh oh that&#39;s actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.490" end="00:13:52.709" style="s2">easy responsibility I mean we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.980" end="00:13:57.790" style="s2">actually even seen it the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.709" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">make a commitment and keep it which</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.790" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">which by the way ideologically shows up</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:03.190" style="s2">is either duty or loyalty but those are</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">both ideologies the the deeper sense is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.190" end="00:14:08.709" style="s2">that ability responsibilities both of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:10.839" style="s2">the individual in the group level the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.709" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">ability to actually really make a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.839" end="00:14:17.050" style="s2">personal sacrifice on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.290" end="00:14:20.050" style="s2">group that&#39;s actually a deeply read</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.050" end="00:14:24.579" style="s2">while you and I don&#39;t mean that by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.050" end="00:14:27.639" style="s2">way as politically ideological certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.579" end="00:14:30.310" style="s2">there are people who are currently part</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.639" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">of blue who feel that deeply what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.310" end="00:14:34.640" style="s2">saying is that that that shows up much</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:36.620" style="s2">much more intensely in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.640" end="00:14:37.910" style="s2">read and when you&#39;re feeling it in blue</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.620" end="00:14:39.350" style="s2">you&#39;re actually feeling a red value and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.910" end="00:14:43.790" style="s2">that&#39;s good mixing that&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.350" end="00:14:46.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s very jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.790" end="00:14:48.260" style="s2">esque - how would you how do you define</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.640" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">jordan peterson or do you think the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.260" end="00:14:53.210" style="s2">the issue is that he is is not definable</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:54.530" style="s2">within one of those two camps yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.210" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">think that&#39;s the point I think that he</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.530" end="00:14:58.640" style="s2">grasps directly the fact that human</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:01.970" style="s2">beings can only actually make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.640" end="00:15:04.250" style="s2">the world by virtue of communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.970" end="00:15:06.650" style="s2">with other human beings and this is all</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.250" end="00:15:09.980" style="s2">about the notion of admixture that one</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.650" end="00:15:11.990" style="s2">must have a mixture of of whoa I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.980" end="00:15:15.770" style="s2">uses the mythopoetic to make sense they</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.990" end="00:15:19.340" style="s2">order order and chaos the way right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.770" end="00:15:22.070" style="s2">Daoist way is the alchemical admixture</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.340" end="00:15:24.740" style="s2">of order and chaos and that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.070" end="00:15:28.130" style="s2">that&#39;s how you do it and so if you bias</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.740" end="00:15:33.080" style="s2">towards orderliness you find yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.130" end="00:15:36.170" style="s2">a rigid non adaptive non creative non</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.080" end="00:15:37.730" style="s2">exploratory framework which will die</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.170" end="00:15:41.660" style="s2">because the world changes</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.730" end="00:15:44.330" style="s2">if you bias towards chaos you you eat</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.660" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">your young and evaporate which also ties</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.330" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">for obvious reasons and the key is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:49.910" style="s2">actually enable these things to be in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:51.830" style="s2">relationship with each other and vital</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.910" end="00:15:53.180" style="s2">healthy relationship with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.830" end="00:15:55.790" style="s2">I think that&#39;s in some sense the essence</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.180" end="00:15:57.890" style="s2">of what he&#39;s focusing on and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.790" end="00:15:59.930" style="s2">the core what he&#39;s acting about Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.890" end="00:16:01.940" style="s2">is hard for the broadcast media to get a</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.930" end="00:16:03.950" style="s2">handle on because the depth of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.940" end="00:16:06.890" style="s2">thought means he doesn&#39;t fit easily into</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.950" end="00:16:09.050" style="s2">any of their categories the clash with</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.890" end="00:16:12.470" style="s2">Kathy Newman was his breakthrough moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.050" end="00:16:14.960" style="s2">where the new world met the old to give</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.470" end="00:16:16.520" style="s2">the context from Kathy Newman side she</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.960" end="00:16:19.430" style="s2">has to do dozens of interviews each</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.520" end="00:16:22.220" style="s2">month Peterson is hard to get a grip on</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.430" end="00:16:24.260" style="s2">and he sure as hell looks controversial</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.220" end="00:16:26.150" style="s2">she&#39;s also focused on getting sound</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.260" end="00:16:28.820" style="s2">bites for a five minute cut down of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.150" end="00:16:32.090" style="s2">interview for TV not a long conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.820" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">for online the interview was ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.090" end="00:16:36.020" style="s2">it was a ridiculous interview I listen</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:37.520" style="s2">to it or watched it several times I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.020" end="00:16:40.280" style="s2">like this is so strange</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.520" end="00:16:42.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like her determination to turn into</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.280" end="00:16:44.690" style="s2">a conflict - it&#39;s one of the issues that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.860" end="00:16:46.820" style="s2">I have with television shows yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.690" end="00:16:48.140" style="s2">because they have a very limited amount</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.820" end="00:16:48.680" style="s2">of time and they&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.140" end="00:16:50.270" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.680" end="00:16:52.550" style="s2">hellacious as possible they won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.270" end="00:16:55.700" style="s2">these soundbites this clickbait</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.550" end="00:16:58.040" style="s2">soundbites and she just went into it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.700" end="00:17:00.140" style="s2">incredibly confrontational not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.040" end="00:17:03.020" style="s2">find your actual perspective but trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.140" end="00:17:05.000" style="s2">to force you to defend a non non</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.020" end="00:17:07.370" style="s2">realistic perspective yes well I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.000" end="00:17:09.709" style="s2">that I was the hypothetical villain of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.370" end="00:17:11.920" style="s2">her imagination essentially no this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.709" end="00:17:15.380" style="s2">also why YouTube is gonna kill TV</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.920" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">because television by its nature all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.380" end="00:17:22.610" style="s2">these narrow broadcast technologies they</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:25.130" style="s2">rely on forcing the story right because</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.610" end="00:17:27.140" style="s2">it has to happen now it has to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.130" end="00:17:28.990" style="s2">like often in five minutes because they</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.140" end="00:17:31.250" style="s2">only broadcast five minutes of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.990" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">interview they did put the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.250" end="00:17:37.429" style="s2">up on YouTube to their credit it it it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:40.190" style="s2">hasn&#39;t ceased to amaze me yet I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.429" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">that they thought that the interview</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.190" end="00:17:45.050" style="s2">went fine after the interview Channel</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.100" end="00:17:47.960" style="s2">four News found themselves at the center</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.050" end="00:17:52.809" style="s2">of an online storm which included some</p>

<p begin="00:18:12.620" end="00:18:18.049" style="s2">why did it happen partly the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.169" end="00:18:20.120" style="s2">of the medium of TV but also because of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.049" end="00:18:22.850" style="s2">the institutional political blindness of</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.929" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">discover the overlap between what I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.970" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">as he particularly liked Greek</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">philosophy and stoicism and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.260" end="00:20:06.020" style="s2">alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.080" style="s2">who I had always thought of you know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.020" end="00:20:10.950" style="s2">I come across in the tour</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.080" end="00:20:14.749" style="s2">the most kind of swivel-eyed bogeymen</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.950" end="00:20:18.149" style="s2">you know completely unpalatable</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.749" end="00:20:21.960" style="s2">extremists in their in their basements</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.149" end="00:20:24.330" style="s2">and then to discover that you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.960" end="00:20:26.369" style="s2">of them were a lot of people into</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.330" end="00:20:29.820" style="s2">stoicism were also really into the old</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.369" end="00:20:33.269" style="s2">Reich made me wonder what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.820" end="00:20:36.419" style="s2">and why people like me we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.269" end="00:20:41.730" style="s2">radicalized and drawn in to explain what</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.419" end="00:20:45.090" style="s2">stoicism is for stoicism is basically an</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.730" end="00:20:47.539" style="s2">ancient Greek philosophy which was</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.090" end="00:20:51.149" style="s2">became very popular in the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.539" end="00:20:53.279" style="s2">you know with like the Emperor Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.149" end="00:20:56.399" style="s2">Aurelius was a stoic for example and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.279" end="00:20:58.710" style="s2">it&#39;s in some ways like a Western form of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.399" end="00:21:00.989" style="s2">Buddhism it&#39;s like a therapy for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.710" end="00:21:03.090" style="s2">emotions it teaches you to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.989" end="00:21:05.730" style="s2">responsibility for your thoughts to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.090" end="00:21:08.940" style="s2">and thereby to take some control over</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.730" end="00:21:11.779" style="s2">your emotions so in some ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.940" end="00:21:16.739" style="s2">putting forward a model of strength and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.779" end="00:21:19.529" style="s2">integrity and kind of resilience amid</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.739" end="00:21:21.899" style="s2">adversity and rapid change so for that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.529" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">reason it&#39;s become very popular in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.899" end="00:21:27.720" style="s2">last ten years I think this is also why</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:29.999" style="s2">from my perspective at least someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.720" end="00:21:32.009" style="s2">like Jordan Pederson is often looked</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.999" end="00:21:33.629" style="s2">from the outside as being aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.009" end="00:21:35.730" style="s2">the alt-right because he has a similar</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.629" end="00:21:37.169" style="s2">message but it&#39;s but there are crucial</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.730" end="00:21:40.139" style="s2">differences I think between what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.169" end="00:21:42.179" style="s2">would consider I mean certainly white</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.139" end="00:21:43.710" style="s2">nationalism would be an essential part</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.179" end="00:21:46.529" style="s2">of the art right I would say of any</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.710" end="00:21:48.210" style="s2">useful definition and yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.529" end="00:21:50.309" style="s2">certainly not characteristic of of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.210" end="00:21:52.830" style="s2">Jordan Peterson from my experience no</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.309" end="00:21:56.129" style="s2">there&#39;s a crucial difference at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.830" end="00:21:57.359" style="s2">between stoicism and the art right even</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.129" end="00:22:00.149" style="s2">though a lot of alt writers and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.359" end="00:22:02.340" style="s2">histories and in that stoicism and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.149" end="00:22:04.619" style="s2">maybe Jordan Peterson as well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.340" end="00:22:08.279" style="s2">know I&#39;m not an expert on him talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.619" end="00:22:12.059" style="s2">the way to gain strength and maturity</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.279" end="00:22:14.399" style="s2">and power is internal it&#39;s to take</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.059" end="00:22:17.340" style="s2">responsibility for your own thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.399" end="00:22:20.580" style="s2">feelings whilst I think people sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.340" end="00:22:26.630" style="s2">men might look for that sense of power</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.580" end="00:22:29.159" style="s2">control externally by suppressing or</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.630" end="00:22:31.169" style="s2">segregating anyone who they feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.159" end="00:22:35.700" style="s2">threatened by whether that&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.169" end="00:22:37.080" style="s2">colors or other sexualities or gender so</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.700" end="00:22:40.169" style="s2">there&#39;s a crucial difference there one</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.080" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">is about kind of inner integrity and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.169" end="00:22:44.100" style="s2">and just kind of being strong within</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:46.019" style="s2">yourself and the other is about trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.100" end="00:22:50.490" style="s2">to take control through the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.019" end="00:22:52.649" style="s2">exterior orders every public appearance</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.490" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">that I&#39;ve made that&#39;s related to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.649" end="00:22:56.789" style="s2">sort of topics that we&#39;re discussing his</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:59.250" style="s2">overwhelmingly men it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.789" end="00:23:00.750" style="s2">eighty-five to ninety percent and so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.250" end="00:23:02.789" style="s2">thought wow that&#39;s weird like what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.750" end="00:23:04.340" style="s2">hell&#39;s going on here exactly and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.789" end="00:23:06.899" style="s2">the other thing I&#39;ve noticed is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.340" end="00:23:08.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking a lot to the crowds</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.899" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been talking to not about</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.340" end="00:23:11.820" style="s2">rights but about responsibility right</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:13.409" style="s2">because he can&#39;t have the bloody</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.820" end="00:23:14.909" style="s2">converse what are you doing you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.409" end="00:23:16.679" style="s2">have the conversation about rights</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.909" end="00:23:19.019" style="s2">without the conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.679" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">responsibility because your rights are</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.019" end="00:23:24.929" style="s2">my responsibility that&#39;s what they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.710" end="00:23:26.610" style="s2">technically so you just can&#39;t have only</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.929" end="00:23:28.500" style="s2">half of that discussion and we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.610" end="00:23:29.909" style="s2">having half that discussion and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.500" end="00:23:32.610" style="s2">question is well what the hell are you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.909" end="00:23:34.830" style="s2">leaving out if you only have that half</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.610" end="00:23:36.330" style="s2">of the discussion and the answer is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.830" end="00:23:38.250" style="s2">you&#39;re leaving out responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.330" end="00:23:39.240" style="s2">then the question is well what are you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.250" end="00:23:41.250" style="s2">leaving out if you&#39;re leaving out</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.240" end="00:23:42.750" style="s2">responsibility and the answer might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.250" end="00:23:45.210" style="s2">well maybe you&#39;re leaving out the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.750" end="00:23:47.539" style="s2">meaning of life that&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.210" end="00:23:50.269" style="s2">like to me it&#39;s like here you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.539" end="00:23:53.580" style="s2">suffering away what makes it worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.269" end="00:23:56.789" style="s2">right you know you&#39;re completely oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.580" end="00:24:00.090" style="s2">you&#39;re completely you have no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.789" end="00:24:03.889" style="s2">you&#39;re you it&#39;s almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.090" end="00:24:07.320" style="s2">describe how bad an idea that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.889" end="00:24:07.889" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s what gives life</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.320" end="00:24:11.190" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.889" end="00:24:12.779" style="s2">it&#39;s like lift a load then you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.190" end="00:24:16.230" style="s2">tolerate yourself right because look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.779" end="00:24:17.750" style="s2">your useless easily hurt easily killed</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.230" end="00:24:21.000" style="s2">why should you have any self-respect</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.750" end="00:24:22.919" style="s2">that&#39;s the story of the fall pick</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.000" end="00:24:24.809" style="s2">something up and carry it pick make it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.919" end="00:24:27.389" style="s2">heavy enough so that you can think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.809" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">well useless as I am at least I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.389" end="00:24:31.110" style="s2">move that from there to there well</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:33.299" style="s2">what&#39;s really cool about that is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.110" end="00:24:34.180" style="s2">when I talk to these crowds about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.299" end="00:24:36.580" style="s2">the man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.180" end="00:24:37.870" style="s2">eyes light up and that&#39;s very like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.580" end="00:24:39.190" style="s2">seen that phenomena because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.870" end="00:24:40.870" style="s2">talking about this mythological material</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.190" end="00:24:42.850" style="s2">for a long time and I can see when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.870" end="00:24:44.860" style="s2">watching crowds people you know their</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.850" end="00:24:46.690" style="s2">eyebrows lift their eyes let light up</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.860" end="00:24:47.230" style="s2">because I put something together for</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.690" end="00:24:49.150" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.230" end="00:24:50.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what mythological stories do so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.150" end="00:24:52.900" style="s2">I&#39;m not taking responsibility for that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.740" end="00:24:54.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what the stories do so I save the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.900" end="00:24:55.960" style="s2">story people go click click click you</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.550" end="00:24:57.820" style="s2">know in their eyes light up</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.960" end="00:24:59.590" style="s2">but this responsibility thing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.820" end="00:25:01.630" style="s2">whole new order of this is that young</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.590" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">men are so hungry for that it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.630" end="00:25:07.330" style="s2">unbelievable it just blows me away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:10.990" style="s2">like really that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.330" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">counterculture grow the hell up and do</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.990" end="00:25:15.280" style="s2">something useful really I could do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">oh I&#39;m so excited by that idea no one</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.280" end="00:25:18.730" style="s2">ever mentioned that before</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:22.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like rights rights rights rights</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.540" end="00:26:58.780" style="s2">was a glitch in the matrix the</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.890" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">you mean when they tried to characterize</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.810" end="00:27:16.450" style="s2">it as sort of abusive trolls and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:18.910" style="s2">right hero and all of that exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.450" end="00:27:20.290" style="s2">exactly the sort of a to use of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.910" end="00:27:22.780" style="s2">military language it was a fallback</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.290" end="00:27:24.910" style="s2">position that was a reactive almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.780" end="00:27:27.280" style="s2">instinctual and not almost in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.910" end="00:27:33.000" style="s2">precisely instinct was that pure habit</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.280" end="00:27:38.110" style="s2">there was no thoughtfulness or even</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.000" end="00:27:40.600" style="s2">strategic action there it was if if X</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.180" end="00:27:47.830" style="s2">re-establish the dominant frame and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.060" end="00:27:50.890" style="s2">we&#39;re now were two levels deep in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.830" end="00:27:52.990" style="s2">first level was a sort of self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.890" end="00:27:54.970" style="s2">disaster but then the second level was</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.990" end="00:27:59.140" style="s2">also a relatively self-evident disaster</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.970" end="00:28:00.520" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t really a third level in</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.140" end="00:28:02.230" style="s2">this approach so it ends up happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.520" end="00:28:04.090" style="s2">and this is again you can kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.230" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">think about this from ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.090" end="00:28:11.080" style="s2">psychology this is how delusions fall</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:12.460" style="s2">apart as try as we might our desire to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.080" end="00:28:14.740" style="s2">interpret reality to mean what we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.460" end="00:28:17.620" style="s2">to mean at the end of the day we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.740" end="00:28:20.890" style="s2">always be checked against what reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.620" end="00:28:23.080" style="s2">actually is it may be some time you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.890" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty good at making things up</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.080" end="00:28:28.540" style="s2">and pretending but eventually reality is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:31.390" style="s2">reality this isn&#39;t to say that Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.540" end="00:28:32.920" style="s2">is not controversial he&#39;s saying things</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.390" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">that challenge the most deeply held</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.920" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">assumptions of the new establishment</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:40.060" style="s2">narrative I guess the other reason that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:42.550" style="s2">people are on my case to some degree is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.060" end="00:28:44.200" style="s2">because I have made a strong case which</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.550" end="00:28:45.610" style="s2">I think is fully documented by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.200" end="00:28:47.470" style="s2">scientific literature that there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.610" end="00:28:49.150" style="s2">intrinsic differences say between men</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.470" end="00:28:51.040" style="s2">and women and I think the evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.150" end="00:28:54.370" style="s2">that this is the thing that staggered me</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.040" end="00:28:56.890" style="s2">is that no serious scientists have</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.370" end="00:29:00.460" style="s2">debated that for like four decades</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.890" end="00:29:01.750" style="s2">it&#39;s that argument was done by the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.460" end="00:29:03.940" style="s2">I went to graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.750" end="00:29:08.160" style="s2">everyone knew that human beings were not</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.940" end="00:29:10.270" style="s2">a blank slate that biological forces not</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.160" end="00:29:12.910" style="s2">parameterised the way that we thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.270" end="00:29:15.610" style="s2">and and felt and acted and and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.910" end="00:29:17.620" style="s2">valued everyone knew that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.610" end="00:29:19.720" style="s2">this has become somehow debatable again</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.620" end="00:29:21.820" style="s2">is just especially because it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.720" end="00:29:25.090" style="s2">done by legislative Fiat they&#39;re forcing</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.820" end="00:29:27.820" style="s2">it part of Peterson&#39;s argument based on</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.090" end="00:29:30.250" style="s2">years of psychological research is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.820" end="00:29:32.020" style="s2">much of the political conflicts are due</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.250" end="00:29:34.860" style="s2">to try to integrate the different</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.020" end="00:29:37.780" style="s2">political temperaments of men and women</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.860" end="00:29:39.670" style="s2">we were talking about the relatively the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.780" end="00:29:41.770" style="s2">relative evolutionary roles of men and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.670" end="00:29:44.680" style="s2">women this is speculative obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.770" end="00:29:47.110" style="s2">and because our research did indicate</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.680" end="00:29:50.680" style="s2">it&#39;s tentative research so far that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.110" end="00:29:53.560" style="s2">the the the SGS SJW sort of equality</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.680" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">above all else philosophy is more</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.560" end="00:29:59.320" style="s2">prevalent among women it&#39;s predicted by</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:02.140" style="s2">the personality factors that are more</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.320" end="00:30:04.300" style="s2">common among women so agreeable this and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.140" end="00:30:06.610" style="s2">high negative emotion primarily</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.300" end="00:30:09.100" style="s2">agreeableness but in addition it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.610" end="00:30:11.130" style="s2">predicted by being female and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.100" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">been thinking about that a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.130" end="00:30:15.490" style="s2">well men are bailing out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">humanities like mad and pretty much out</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.490" end="00:30:19.450" style="s2">of the universities except for stem the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:21.280" style="s2">women are moving in like mad and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.450" end="00:30:23.110" style="s2">also moving into the political sphere</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.280" end="00:30:24.850" style="s2">like mad and this is new right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.110" end="00:30:26.290" style="s2">never had this happen before and we do</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.850" end="00:30:28.120" style="s2">know no do not know what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.290" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">significance of it is it&#39;s only fifty</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.120" end="00:30:32.320" style="s2">years old and so we were thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:34.660" style="s2">this and so I don&#39;t know what you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.320" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">about this proposition but imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.660" end="00:30:40.420" style="s2">that that historically speaking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:41.770" style="s2">something like women were responsible</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.420" end="00:30:44.440" style="s2">for distribution and men were</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.770" end="00:30:46.510" style="s2">responsible for production something</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.440" end="00:30:49.150" style="s2">like that and maybe maybe that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.510" end="00:30:50.620" style="s2">the case really in the tight confines of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.150" end="00:30:51.820" style="s2">the immediate family but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.620" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">matter because that&#39;s most of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.820" end="00:30:55.720" style="s2">evolutionary landscape for human beings</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:58.750" style="s2">anyways what the women doesn&#39;t did was</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.720" end="00:31:00.220" style="s2">make sure that everybody got enough okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.750" end="00:31:02.530" style="s2">and that seems to me to be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.220" end="00:31:05.470" style="s2">things that&#39;s driving at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.530" end="00:31:06.970" style="s2">the SJW demand for for equity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.470" end="00:31:09.790" style="s2">equality it&#39;s like let&#39;s make sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.970" end="00:31:11.530" style="s2">everybody has enough it&#39;s like look fair</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.790" end="00:31:13.540" style="s2">enough you know I mean you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.530" end="00:31:15.220" style="s2">can&#39;t argue with that but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.540" end="00:31:17.710" style="s2">there&#39;s an antipathy</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.220" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">between that and the the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.710" end="00:31:21.130" style="s2">differential productivity you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.450" end="00:31:23.620" style="s2">because people really do differ in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.130" end="00:31:25.539" style="s2">productivity I think that the SJW</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.620" end="00:31:27.280" style="s2">phenomena is different and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.539" end="00:31:29.880" style="s2">associated at least in part with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.280" end="00:31:32.740" style="s2">rise of women to political power and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.880" end="00:31:34.450" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what women are like when</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.740" end="00:31:36.820" style="s2">they have political power because</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.450" end="00:31:38.409" style="s2">they&#39;ve never had it I mean there&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.409" end="00:31:42.070" style="s2">there&#39;s been female authority figures</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.820" end="00:31:43.809" style="s2">and females have wielded far more power</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.070" end="00:31:45.700" style="s2">historically than feminists generally</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.809" end="00:31:47.409" style="s2">like to admit but this is a different</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.260" end="00:32:55.659" style="s2">we each have both an inner masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.450" end="00:32:57.669" style="s2">feminine essence in a man when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.659" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">unconsciously possessed by his feminine</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.669" end="00:33:03.669" style="s2">side his anima he becomes withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:05.890" style="s2">Moody and reactive and when a woman is</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.669" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">possessed by her male side the animus</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:11.470" style="s2">she becomes aggressive and dominating</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:13.530" style="s2">and how many women are pushed into that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.470" end="00:33:16.179" style="s2">by the nature of the modern workplace</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.530" end="00:33:18.760" style="s2">the Kathy Newman I know is warm</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.179" end="00:33:21.100" style="s2">compassionate a successful and talented</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.760" end="00:33:23.470" style="s2">journalist none of this is criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.100" end="00:33:23.920" style="s2">her just the role she was playing in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.470" end="00:33:26.020" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.920" end="00:33:27.670" style="s2">I would say technically and this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.020" end="00:33:29.920" style="s2">might be interesting for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.670" end="00:33:32.110" style="s2">interested in Union psychology if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.920" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">want to understand what Carl Jung meant</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.110" end="00:33:36.940" style="s2">by animus possession which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:40.540" style="s2">difficult concept then that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.940" end="00:33:42.430" style="s2">interview was a textbook case of having</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.540" end="00:33:45.730" style="s2">a discussion with someone who is animus</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.430" end="00:33:47.790" style="s2">possessed life has been moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.730" end="00:33:50.710" style="s2">for three and a half billion years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.790" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">it moves forward in these pattern</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.710" end="00:33:54.370" style="s2">manners like the dominance hierarchy for</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:56.350" style="s2">example so that&#39;s that let&#39;s call that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.370" end="00:33:59.880" style="s2">the masculine archetype it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.350" end="00:34:02.230" style="s2">masculine archetype in fact the onus</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.880" end="00:34:05.260" style="s2">Proclamation was that the female</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.230" end="00:34:08.830" style="s2">representation of the male so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.260" end="00:34:12.370" style="s2">animus is the dominance hierarchy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.830" end="00:34:14.500" style="s2">the patriarchy so that&#39;s that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.370" end="00:34:16.330" style="s2">unconscious archetype which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.500" end="00:34:17.590" style="s2">extremely interesting given what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.330" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">happened say in the women&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.590" end="00:34:23.260" style="s2">because that&#39;s what&#39;s projected on to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:24.700" style="s2">man and and it can be projected in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.260" end="00:34:27.820" style="s2">very negative way it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.700" end="00:34:30.160" style="s2">but it can be and so an animus possessed</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.820" end="00:34:31.780" style="s2">woman treats a man as if he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.160" end="00:34:32.500" style="s2">manifestation of the tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.780" end="00:34:36.040" style="s2">patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.500" end="00:34:38.350" style="s2">he&#39;s a group he&#39;s that group of men yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.040" end="00:34:40.690" style="s2">the group of bad man naturally you watch</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.350" end="00:34:42.070" style="s2">the Jordan Peterson Kathy Nieman</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.690" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">interview what did he what did he think</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.070" end="00:34:53.100" style="s2">oh I my whole body contracted and I I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:35:00.610" style="s2">felt so sad for womanhood I felt</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.100" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">disappointed and I could see how the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.610" end="00:35:07.690" style="s2">shadow part of womanhood was acting out</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:11.830" style="s2">I could see how the collective rage was</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.690" end="00:35:14.470" style="s2">acting through Kathy Newman and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.830" end="00:35:18.940" style="s2">what happens is that when that&#39;s unknown</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.470" end="00:35:22.180" style="s2">its projected blindly on to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.940" end="00:35:24.340" style="s2">stick wherever it sticks and it was very</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.180" end="00:35:26.230" style="s2">clear that she already had an agenda and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.340" end="00:35:29.110" style="s2">she already had a projection that she</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.230" end="00:35:31.060" style="s2">was just looking to state she was she</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.110" end="00:35:35.080" style="s2">was just looking to have that confirmed</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.060" end="00:35:37.630" style="s2">so I felt on behalf of women I felt sad</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.080" end="00:35:40.930" style="s2">and disappointed because we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.630" end="00:35:42.970" style="s2">to have intelligent conversations and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.930" end="00:35:45.160" style="s2">also want to say that this isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.970" end="00:35:46.750" style="s2">though that the specific example is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.160" end="00:35:50.140" style="s2">Kathy Newman Jordan Peters an interview</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.750" end="00:35:52.329" style="s2">it&#39;s not specific to to Kathy Newman I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.140" end="00:35:53.890" style="s2">think the fact that that interview has</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.329" end="00:35:55.779" style="s2">resonated with so many people that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.890" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">been so popular shows that actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.779" end="00:36:02.470" style="s2">something archetypal was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:05.710" style="s2">that in that interaction and I think as</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.470" end="00:36:08.259" style="s2">well why it&#39;s gone viral is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.710" end="00:36:09.579" style="s2">people watching it recognize those</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.259" end="00:36:12.069" style="s2">dynamics they&#39;re like I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.579" end="00:36:13.539" style="s2">conversations like that I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.069" end="00:36:16.900" style="s2">this conversation where nothing I say</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.539" end="00:36:18.130" style="s2">works but nothing I say gets through so</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.900" end="00:36:20.140" style="s2">there&#39;s something sort of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.130" end="00:36:21.490" style="s2">about about the masculine feminine</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.140" end="00:36:23.380" style="s2">dynamic that&#39;s going on in there</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.490" end="00:36:26.140" style="s2">what do you think that is I think Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.380" end="00:36:29.289" style="s2">Peterson he&#39;s everyman Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.140" end="00:36:32.289" style="s2">she&#39;s every woman I can tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.289" end="00:36:33.880" style="s2">rage like this I know it in myself and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.289" end="00:36:36.460" style="s2">women that say they don&#39;t they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.880" end="00:36:38.730" style="s2">denying it because it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.460" end="00:36:40.869" style="s2">collective so in that sense it just</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.730" end="00:36:44.140" style="s2">highlighted what what&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.869" end="00:36:48.309" style="s2">wonderful because here we really get to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.140" end="00:36:51.849" style="s2">look at why is this so important why is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.309" end="00:36:54.519" style="s2">it so important to listen to to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.849" end="00:36:56.980" style="s2">thinker like Jordan Peterson and take it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.519" end="00:37:00.339" style="s2">seriously and say what can we do with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.980" end="00:37:03.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just so obvious that it&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.339" end="00:37:05.589" style="s2">because if this is where we are if this</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.160" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">is where society and cultures is if this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.589" end="00:37:10.119" style="s2">is the ability to have an intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:12.130" style="s2">conversations conversation then we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.119" end="00:37:16.690" style="s2">in trouble I really feel that there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.130" end="00:37:21.039" style="s2">this collective subconscious rage that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.690" end="00:37:23.380" style="s2">is just boiling in women and it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.039" end="00:37:27.150" style="s2">up in so many ways we see we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.380" end="00:37:30.730" style="s2">media and what&#39;s going on is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.150" end="00:37:35.589" style="s2">unknown rage that comes up in in many</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.730" end="00:37:38.619" style="s2">different ways and on one hand it needs</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.589" end="00:37:40.569" style="s2">to come out we need to clear it it needs</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.619" end="00:37:43.990" style="s2">to be expressed it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.569" end="00:37:46.450" style="s2">acknowledged on the other hand it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.990" end="00:37:50.200" style="s2">enough this is only like this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.450" end="00:37:51.269" style="s2">breaking the ice so that the next step</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.200" end="00:37:54.359" style="s2">of evolution can</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.269" end="00:37:56.249" style="s2">you know consciousness can start coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.359" end="00:37:59.249" style="s2">through and that&#39;s what I&#39;m lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.249" end="00:38:02.359" style="s2">women it&#39;s really to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.249" end="00:38:05.579" style="s2">for what we do as women in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.359" end="00:38:09.779" style="s2">manipulation in our seduction in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.579" end="00:38:11.699" style="s2">control and and it&#39;s so easy for women</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.779" end="00:38:13.739" style="s2">to say but that&#39;s just because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.699" end="00:38:16.549" style="s2">angry and men did this and patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.739" end="00:38:19.409" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s such a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.549" end="00:38:21.539" style="s2">responsibility and this women really</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.409" end="00:38:24.209" style="s2">need to know I mean that&#39;s the the kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.539" end="00:38:27.059" style="s2">of shadow work is the acceptance that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.209" end="00:38:28.169" style="s2">all have shadows that men certainly have</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.059" end="00:38:30.809" style="s2">a shadow there is a shadow around</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.169" end="00:38:34.199" style="s2">masculinity but there&#39;s also a shadow</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.809" end="00:38:36.059" style="s2">around femininity and while part of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.199" end="00:38:38.159" style="s2">cultural conversation now is toxic</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.059" end="00:38:41.489" style="s2">masculinity and everyone knows what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.159" end="00:38:44.069" style="s2">mean by toxic toxic masculinity if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.489" end="00:38:45.809" style="s2">talk about toxic femininity everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.069" end="00:38:48.569" style="s2">still knows what you mean but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.809" end="00:38:50.609" style="s2">have that conversation which is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.569" end="00:38:52.199" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting what is allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.609" end="00:38:55.729" style="s2">said and what is not allowed to be said</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.199" end="00:39:00.179" style="s2">at the moment and that dad I think is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.729" end="00:39:02.459" style="s2">very dangerous that certain topics</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.179" end="00:39:04.949" style="s2">certain conversations are off are</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.459" end="00:39:07.319" style="s2">off-limits and this is where we see</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.949" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">where we see the victim persecutor</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.319" end="00:39:12.630" style="s2">dynamics activates it because women</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:14.789" style="s2">become the become the victims and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.630" end="00:39:17.369" style="s2">make ourselves the victims and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.789" end="00:39:19.349" style="s2">persecute men but in that aggression in</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.369" end="00:39:22.709" style="s2">that reach and when we are the victims</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.349" end="00:39:26.579" style="s2">we are in perfect control we become the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.709" end="00:39:30.029" style="s2">persecutors because we say it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.579" end="00:39:32.759" style="s2">about blame men did this and men need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.029" end="00:39:34.679" style="s2">take responsibility but in that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.759" end="00:39:36.899" style="s2">become the persecutors and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.679" end="00:39:40.769" style="s2">very difficult as well because one</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.899" end="00:39:42.389" style="s2">imagines that that combative attitude is</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.769" end="00:39:44.279" style="s2">something that has served her well in</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.389" end="00:39:46.169" style="s2">the past and it&#39;s something that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.279" end="00:39:47.399" style="s2">maybe felt forced into because of the</p>
