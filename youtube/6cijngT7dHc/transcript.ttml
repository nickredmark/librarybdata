<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:32.040" style="s2">just briefly mention Michael Commons</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.289" end="00:00:34.829" style="s2">he&#39;s responsible for the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.040" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">higher levels of formal operation go</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.829" end="00:00:53.210" style="s2">from systemic thinking to meta systemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:01:00.649" style="s2">thinking to paradigm our paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.210" end="00:01:00.649" style="s2">thinking to what he calls cross</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.329" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">paradigmatic thinking and so by</p>

<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:27.020" style="s2">methodologies of people the level of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">cognitive capacity can be codified in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.020" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">these different ways so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">sophistication it measures a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">sophistication of reasoning with</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:55.700" style="s2">abstractions now the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">to note is that in the skills based</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.700" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">models they follow PA JS philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:12.740" style="s2">pretty tightly then p IJ understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:24.050" style="s2">development as um eliminating</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.740" end="00:02:26.710" style="s2">addictions so if you&#39;re working on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.050" end="00:02:34.370" style="s2">problem if you&#39;re working on a problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.710" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">to seek understanding then at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.370" end="00:02:41.660" style="s2">level of a problem you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">contradiction between the empirical</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.660" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">facts or what you observe you see and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:03:05.650" style="s2">your ability to explain it so you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:08.630" style="s2">come up with a logical contradiction but</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.650" end="00:03:11.090" style="s2">the contradiction is between your</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.630" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">ability to explain in the world so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.090" end="00:03:20.120" style="s2">contradiction is between the expand and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:24.200" style="s2">and the observation so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.120" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">scientific mind set these they do not</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.200" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">really talked about in the skill sets</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:34.040" style="s2">models they don&#39;t really look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:36.710" style="s2">inherent paradoxes or contradictions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.040" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">the mind itself it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.710" end="00:03:44.320" style="s2">scientific methodology an empirical kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:47.540" style="s2">of approach to cognitive skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.320" end="00:03:51.140" style="s2">development and so that&#39;s what you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.540" end="00:03:53.900" style="s2">what Commons is doing is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.140" end="00:03:57.740" style="s2">observing phenomenon and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.900" end="00:04:01.070" style="s2">linear pre systematically of a linear</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.740" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">type of understanding then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.070" end="00:04:05.390" style="s2">the problems are going to be more</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:07.940" style="s2">complex and you&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.390" end="00:04:13.180" style="s2">contradiction between your prediction</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.940" end="00:04:20.209" style="s2">let&#39;s say and the outcome based upon</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.180" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">your theory and so this this actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.209" end="00:04:28.810" style="s2">fouls quite closely to someone like Hyun</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:31.470" style="s2">so the contradiction is not inside the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.810" end="00:04:34.030" style="s2">mind but it&#39;s between the empirical</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.470" end="00:04:37.479" style="s2">observations experimental setup the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.030" end="00:04:40.570" style="s2">ability to predict and so from going</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.479" end="00:04:45.270" style="s2">when a linear understanding no longer</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.570" end="00:04:49.800" style="s2">functions then a systematic approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.270" end="00:04:52.510" style="s2">does better and then when a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.800" end="00:04:56.889" style="s2">understanding no longer is effective</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.510" end="00:04:59.889" style="s2">then the developmental trajectory is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.889" end="00:05:03.040" style="s2">toward being medicine somatic and when a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.889" end="00:05:07.300" style="s2">meta systematic or so meta systematic</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.040" end="00:05:11.410" style="s2">looks at systems so for a meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.300" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">systematic the object of inquiry is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.410" end="00:05:17.380" style="s2">system itself once the meta systemic</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">level no longer produces effects then</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.380" end="00:05:22.470" style="s2">there needs to be a paradigm change so</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:29.950" style="s2">that the the the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.470" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">assumptions that have been there all</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.950" end="00:05:37.060" style="s2">along tend to get changed in a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:39.130" style="s2">shift then there are systems of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.060" end="00:05:41.220" style="s2">paradigms ways to look at problems and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.130" end="00:05:44.139" style="s2">systems of paradigms which are cross</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.220" end="00:05:49.510" style="s2">paradigmatic types of reasoning so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.139" end="00:05:51.700" style="s2">Michael Commons is a model and there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.510" end="00:05:56.110" style="s2">very bird during many different versions</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.700" end="00:05:59.789" style="s2">of it are based upon looking at problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.110" end="00:06:02.669" style="s2">solving cognitive capacity within this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.789" end="00:06:09.330" style="s2">framework there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.669" end="00:06:14.610" style="s2">dialectical indication or exploration in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.330" end="00:06:21.090" style="s2">his system and not in the skills based</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.610" end="00:06:21.090" style="s2">developmental camp at all in general</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.220" end="00:06:31.070" style="s2">one of the most interesting models of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.889" end="00:06:38.150" style="s2">development in the skills camp is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.070" end="00:06:46.300" style="s2">of Harvard philosopher psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.150" end="00:06:57.139" style="s2">current Fisher and he has a skills or</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.300" end="00:07:01.930" style="s2">task-based developmental theory that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.139" end="00:07:06.139" style="s2">looks at development in the progress of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.930" end="00:07:08.419" style="s2">development in a very interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.139" end="00:07:13.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s been very successful in many</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.419" end="00:07:19.340" style="s2">ways and so he categorizes levels of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.240" end="00:07:24.139" style="s2">engagement has primary levels of skills</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.340" end="00:07:34.250" style="s2">and task task about actions the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.139" end="00:07:39.910" style="s2">level is representations the next level</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.250" end="00:07:39.910" style="s2">would be that he calls abstractions and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.229" end="00:07:47.889" style="s2">the next level up he calls principles</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.539" end="00:07:56.060" style="s2">now the interesting thing is that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.729" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">movement between each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.060" end="00:08:06.620" style="s2">levels Fischer has identified as being a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:12.260" style="s2">pattern so there&#39;s a similar pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.620" end="00:08:14.889" style="s2">it&#39;s this pattern that he is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.260" end="00:08:18.950" style="s2">interested in identifying and studying</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.889" end="00:08:30.700" style="s2">and so the pattern goes from what he</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.950" end="00:08:34.370" style="s2">calls single things to mappings to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.700" end="00:08:37.750" style="s2">systems so what he&#39;s saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.370" end="00:08:42.200" style="s2">unlike comments is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.750" end="00:08:46.070" style="s2">Systems type movements or developments</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.200" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">in the lower ranges of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.070" end="00:08:52.250" style="s2">capacity it&#39;s just that we don&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:54.430" style="s2">so simple the systems are so simple that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.250" end="00:09:00.380" style="s2">we haven&#39;t looked at them as simple</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.430" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">systems and so for example a toddler app</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.380" end="00:09:12.829" style="s2">actually goes from performing single</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:17.630" style="s2">actions to mapping those actions mapping</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.829" end="00:09:19.430" style="s2">of actions cognitively in several</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.630" end="00:09:23.420" style="s2">different way so you have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.430" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">different mapping relationships and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.420" end="00:09:35.209" style="s2">he takes those mapping of actions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">organizes them into a simple system so</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.209" end="00:09:42.020" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of organization of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:46.430" style="s2">actions the referee the mapping of those</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.020" end="00:09:49.130" style="s2">actions cognitively and into a simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.430" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">system and at a certain point this</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.130" end="00:10:01.310" style="s2">system itself becomes so manipulative or</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:05.510" style="s2">the person that the simp this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.310" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">system this system of maps of actions</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.510" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">can become its own single thing it</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">becomes a single representation and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:24.850" style="s2">the still a young person here tends to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:29.770" style="s2">have a collection of single</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.850" end="00:10:33.649" style="s2">representations that get mapped as</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.770" end="00:10:35.690" style="s2">napped representations and as at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.649" end="00:10:38.990" style="s2">point they get enough collections of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.690" end="00:10:46.520" style="s2">math representations the certain stage</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.990" end="00:10:49.940" style="s2">the individual creates a system of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.520" end="00:10:51.050" style="s2">mapped representations and that after a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.940" end="00:10:52.779" style="s2">certain pair</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.050" end="00:11:00.490" style="s2">period of time and cognitive growth</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.779" end="00:11:05.529" style="s2">capacity which is is pushed or pulled by</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.490" end="00:11:08.990" style="s2">the need to develop skills through</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.529" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">various tasks or problems that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.990" end="00:11:18.410" style="s2">individual confronts then eventually the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:22.970" style="s2">person is able to look at these systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.410" end="00:11:26.899" style="s2">or representations as single things and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.970" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">in this case they become single</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.899" end="00:11:36.310" style="s2">abstractions and then the single</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.279" end="00:11:36.310" style="s2">abstractions not surprisingly get mapped</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.670" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">abstractions and you get a collections</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.019" end="00:11:46.130" style="s2">of these mapped abstractions that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:49.160" style="s2">individual can utilize for problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.130" end="00:11:53.079" style="s2">solving but eventually all these this</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.160" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">collection of mapped abstractions right</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.079" end="00:12:07.070" style="s2">become themselves a system and so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:11.690" style="s2">individual systematize is the collection</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.070" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">of mapped abstractions and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.690" end="00:12:18.110" style="s2">abstractions were mapped from</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.260" end="00:12:29.990" style="s2">representations that were once you only</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.570" end="00:12:33.250" style="s2">available to the individual as systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.990" end="00:12:37.459" style="s2">events of actions and so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.250" end="00:12:39.860" style="s2">movement back in up levels through this</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.459" end="00:12:43.370" style="s2">process of taking what&#39;s available</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.860" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">initially only as a single item mapping</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.370" end="00:12:49.339" style="s2">it cognitively at which point it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:51.620" style="s2">it eventually becomes able to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.339" end="00:12:54.019" style="s2">integrated or organized into system</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.620" end="00:12:57.949" style="s2">eventually that system of organization</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.019" end="00:13:02.360" style="s2">can be handled again as a single thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.949" end="00:13:04.440" style="s2">in the next higher level in the last</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.360" end="00:13:07.640" style="s2">move in Fishers scheme</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.440" end="00:13:14.340" style="s2">is that these map the systems of mapped</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.640" end="00:13:19.400" style="s2">abstractions then become principles and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.340" end="00:13:19.400" style="s2">they become single principles and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.120" end="00:13:28.290" style="s2">assumption is that then that can go on</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.130" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">from there so this is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.290" end="00:13:36.390" style="s2">and what&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:38.940" style="s2">interested me about this system and one</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.390" end="00:13:42.780" style="s2">of Curt Fisher&#39;s students is zach&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.940" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">dying and I asked him if in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.780" end="00:13:50.790" style="s2">studies did anyone ever experienced a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:52.430" style="s2">principle so when they&#39;re doing studies</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.790" end="00:13:56.700" style="s2">and they find out that they belissa</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.430" end="00:13:58.950" style="s2">tadesse movement forward principles does</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.700" end="00:14:05.250" style="s2">anyone ever experienced principles not</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.950" end="00:14:09.540" style="s2">as being up this sequence but somehow</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.250" end="00:14:13.530" style="s2">being foundational to the actions in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.540" end="00:14:16.110" style="s2">first place right so did anyone ever</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.530" end="00:14:19.530" style="s2">find a principle that they felt was</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.110" end="00:14:22.290" style="s2">actually there all along experience that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.530" end="00:14:25.080" style="s2">principle as foundational even to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.290" end="00:14:28.200" style="s2">actions so along this whole sequence was</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.080" end="00:14:34.470" style="s2">there ever this undertow right this</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.200" end="00:14:37.500" style="s2">question of an undertow and zach stein</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.470" end="00:14:40.260" style="s2">said that to his knowledge that had</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.500" end="00:14:43.950" style="s2">never been articulated and for me that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.260" end="00:14:47.250" style="s2">would be key that would be key if a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.950" end="00:14:52.110" style="s2">person experienced this progression up</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.250" end="00:14:55.410" style="s2">to a principle as actually seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.110" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">the principal might be foundational to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.410" end="00:15:05.810" style="s2">the process so ontological ii prior now</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:07.770" style="s2">this does not exist in Kurt Fisher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.810" end="00:15:09.420" style="s2">system but because we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.770" end="00:15:13.200" style="s2">going to come back to curtain Fisher</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.420" end="00:15:18.310" style="s2">system just wanted to to share with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.200" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">that if this would be for me the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.310" end="00:15:28.080" style="s2">oh that would signal a post post formal</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:31.510" style="s2">beyond a formal operational</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.080" end="00:15:34.960" style="s2">understanding and so the flavor of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.510" end="00:15:37.930" style="s2">will say and self has been developed in</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.960" end="00:15:43.630" style="s2">some of the other developmental model</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.930" end="00:15:48.180" style="s2">based on meaning and it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.630" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">the fact that the inquiry turns inward</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.180" end="00:15:53.260" style="s2">toward the assumptions or they toured</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.160" end="00:15:55.900" style="s2">the processes in the mind itself but</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.260" end="00:15:58.330" style="s2">this does not happen or is not part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.900" end="00:16:07.740" style="s2">what&#39;s measured in the skills task</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.330" end="00:16:07.740" style="s2">development models okay now</p>
