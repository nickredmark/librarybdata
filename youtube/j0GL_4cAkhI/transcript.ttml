<p begin="00:00:13.010" end="00:00:15.010" style="s2">You</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.440" end="00:00:21.440" style="s2">So everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.950" end="00:00:27.499" style="s2">When I never met in person I never met Jordan Peterson in person</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.290" end="00:00:31.669" style="s2">But I said to him when we met right before lunch</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.970" end="00:00:38.989" style="s2">Something that I said to me by so many people who meet me for the first time. I feel like I know you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:43.940" style="s2">I that is the highest compliment in in effect</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.940" end="00:00:48.979" style="s2">I now understand what a compliment that is what I receive it because I never gave it to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:51.590" style="s2">before you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:56.269" style="s2">I have watched you for hours and listen</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:04.339" style="s2">To you and read your book and in fact, I didn&#39;t just read your book. I heard your book from you</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:11.419" style="s2">so I want to tell you something without embarrassing you, but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.990" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">I&#39;d like to you open your heart and your mind and so do I?</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.050" end="00:01:24.079" style="s2">When I was very young I realized that God or nature had given me</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.649" end="00:01:28.099" style="s2">What I have called a goodness detector</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">And I knew I always knew when I was in the presence of a good person</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.539" end="00:01:41.809" style="s2">Because that&#39;s all I really care about. I think brains are wildly overrated</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:44.789" style="s2">wildly</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.789" end="00:01:48.499" style="s2">That&#39;s why I think you&#39;re not bright if you join Mensa</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:56.149" style="s2">Why you would want to announce to the world your IQ is so bizarre to me that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:03.049" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there are nice people there, but I I don&#39;t understand it, but I always picked up</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">That and I&#39;ve and I&#39;ve always been right</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:10.309" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a I&#39;m batting a thousand essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:14.029" style="s2">When I heard you read your book</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:17.000" style="s2">the passion comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.970" end="00:02:19.950" style="s2">from I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:23.600" style="s2">want to help people lead a better life and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:29.629" style="s2">It&#39;s really it&#39;s it&#39;s quite overwhelming you you didn&#39;t just read that book you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:37.399" style="s2">Won&#39;t say you sang it but I like that you use music. I&#39;m very much into music, too</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.340" end="00:02:40.340" style="s2">so this is the man that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:45.860" style="s2">Honored to have this dialogue with because you&#39;re out everybody knows you&#39;re bright</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.680" end="00:02:48.680" style="s2">But I know you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.170" end="00:02:52.099" style="s2">So I want them to take that at the outset. I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.019" end="00:03:07.009" style="s2">Was something to say about that good that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">See I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.780" end="00:03:17.780" style="s2">mean, this is why I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.689" end="00:03:26.689" style="s2">Got motivated to do what I&#39;ve been doing and I&#39;ve been doing what I&#39;ve been doing for. I would say since about</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.569" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">1979</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:33.199" style="s2">In one form or another because things take a long time to generate</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.900" end="00:03:37.489" style="s2">and one of the things I learned in the early 80s was that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.609" end="00:03:44.209" style="s2">People have a great capacity for evil and I didn&#39;t really understand that of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:48.799" style="s2">until</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:54.290" style="s2">The early eighties something like that after meditating on it for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.699" end="00:03:58.699" style="s2">So I would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.459" end="00:04:04.668" style="s2">It&#39;s not that done I would never claim to be good. I think it&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.810" end="00:04:10.519" style="s2">But I did become terrified of how terrible I could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.609" end="00:04:18.168" style="s2">And I mean, I became terrified about how terrible human beings could be and that&#39;s one thing but that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.169" end="00:04:20.169" style="s2">It&#39;s easy to confuse that with other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.060" end="00:04:23.179" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s a different thing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.120" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">Understand that it&#39;s true of yourself. I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:32.359" style="s2">often recommend to my students that they read history as a perpetrator and not as a victim or a hero and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:35.329" style="s2">People very seldom do that and it&#39;s no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:43.370" style="s2">But I would say perhaps that I became terrified enough from learning what I learned that I tried</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.270" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:50.269" style="s2">Avoid the pathways that lead people to the dark places that they go</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.580" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">And there&#39;s something in that that might approximate good</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.050" end="00:04:59.479" style="s2">Yeah, it does approximate good III I I would agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.410" end="00:05:06.410" style="s2">The parallels between</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.320" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">Us are so eerie to me that in my book on happiness, which came out of 99. I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.950" end="00:05:18.920" style="s2">Actually have a chapter on the necessity of having a tragic view of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.950" end="00:05:24.470" style="s2">and then I hear you speak of light just now this tragic view of life and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">Ironically if you don&#39;t have that you can&#39;t be happy</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.550" end="00:05:31.699" style="s2">so it&#39;s just another example of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.370" end="00:05:34.789" style="s2">This in that you&#39;re getting this message out</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.040" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">if you want to comment on that, please if not</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:42.710" style="s2">I&#39;ll go on I you you you are such an I watch you and you&#39;re such an intense listener</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.710" end="00:05:45.079" style="s2">I don&#39;t know when you&#39;re gonna react so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">There&#39;s this old idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">You know you all know this idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.430" end="00:05:55.430" style="s2">It&#39;s an idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.920" end="00:06:00.830" style="s2">Expressed for example in the classic Disney movie classic Disney movie which I really like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.470" end="00:06:06.889" style="s2">called Pinocchio and you know when Pinocchio is attempting to free himself from</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.800" end="00:06:13.160" style="s2">the forces that manipulate him as a puppet and to become an autonomous being</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.100" end="00:06:16.580" style="s2">He is required to go to the darkest place</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.790" end="00:06:19.790" style="s2">To find the worst</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.420" end="00:06:22.710" style="s2">Catastrophes that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.710" end="00:06:28.189" style="s2">Voluntarily and in doing so he rescues his father. That&#39;s a very old idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">Don&#39;t know how old it is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.450" end="00:06:34.980" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.980" end="00:06:40.759" style="s2">It&#39;s one of the oldest ideas we have in written form and and there&#39;s no doubt that in its pre written form</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.760" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">it would be tens of thousands of years older than that and it&#39;s a very strange idea that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.070" end="00:06:51.230" style="s2">Journey to the darkest abyss to free the spirit of your father</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.430" end="00:06:56.869" style="s2">But there&#39;s a reason for it and it has to do with the tragic view of life</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.230" end="00:07:01.789" style="s2">Which is that you can&#39;t discover</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.150" end="00:07:05.150" style="s2">What you&#39;re capable of?</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.910" end="00:07:09.679" style="s2">Being or withstanding and and those are the same things</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:15.590" style="s2">Without if you hide away from any of the things about life that are terrible</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.590" end="00:07:18.949" style="s2">but true and and and the reason you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.560" end="00:07:20.850" style="s2">discover</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.850" end="00:07:22.850" style="s2">Who you are?</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.950" end="00:07:29.630" style="s2">without doing that is that only necessity will force that out of you and and it I mean that I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.180" end="00:07:36.259" style="s2">From the perspective of learning if you go work in a palliative care award. You&#39;ll learn to deal with death</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.080" end="00:07:41.720" style="s2">you&#39;ll learn that this psychological strategies necessary the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.300" end="00:07:49.100" style="s2">Steps you&#39;ll become more informed but it&#39;s deeper than that. Even we know now from a biological perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.710" end="00:07:53.720" style="s2">If you put yourself in new situations in new and challenging situations</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.540" end="00:08:01.220" style="s2">That new genes turn on in your nervous system and code for new proteins that produce new neurological structures</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.220" end="00:08:04.669" style="s2">And so you can&#39;t even be what you are fully</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.070" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">biologically unless you expose yourself to everything that you can expose yourself to as you journey through life the old idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.320" end="00:08:21.740" style="s2">Pilgrimage was predicated on on that idea as is walking the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.690" end="00:08:27.350" style="s2">Shark Cathedral the the labyrinth</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.350" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">The idea that you walk the labyrinth in in Chartres and you come to the center is that you traverse every corner of the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:39.890" style="s2">quarter by quarter, and then you come to the center and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.380" end="00:08:45.650" style="s2">The center is the center of the church and it&#39;s the center of the crucifixion. It&#39;s the center of suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.160" end="00:08:49.730" style="s2">You can&#39;t get to what that Center</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:55.069" style="s2">Signifies without having journeyed everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.370" end="00:08:58.370" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.610" end="00:09:01.910" style="s2">The tragic view of life is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.810" end="00:09:05.960" style="s2">Because it puts you on the journey that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.990" end="00:09:10.790" style="s2">reveals to yourself who you could be if you were courageous as</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.030" end="00:09:18.259" style="s2">courageous as you could be and as truthful as you could be and that&#39;s equivalent to discovering 2/3 vivifying your dead father because you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:24.830" style="s2">Are an ancient creature in some sense and and perhaps one with a spark of divinity</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.970" end="00:09:30.259" style="s2">Inherent in it, but you will never release that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.810" end="00:09:37.099" style="s2">Unless you&#39;re willing to go everywhere that you have to go because only necessity will call that out of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.100" end="00:09:39.100" style="s2">and so you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.220" end="00:09:42.870" style="s2">Happy</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.870" end="00:09:45.139" style="s2">You can&#39;t be complete without</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.020" end="00:09:50.780" style="s2">You can&#39;t know what you could withstand. You can&#39;t have any proper sense of self-respect</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:55.310" style="s2">unless you know what you can tolerate and if you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.030" end="00:10:04.220" style="s2">Everything that you have reason to avoid but should nonetheless not avoid you won&#39;t know who you are and then you can&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.220" end="00:10:06.660" style="s2">properly</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.660" end="00:10:14.540" style="s2">So you you have said on a number of occasions and in every on every occasion that I have watched you say it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.570" end="00:10:23.240" style="s2">Not a single person in the panel you often talk on panels. Not one person has ever actually reacted to it. I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.450" end="00:10:25.830" style="s2">Totally get it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.830" end="00:10:32.210" style="s2">Nevertheless, it&#39;s one of the most important things you regularly say you live as if there is a God</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.060" end="00:10:35.060" style="s2">Is that correct?</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.250" end="00:10:41.000" style="s2">well people ask me if I believe in God, you know, I just said I&#39;m gonna release a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.520" end="00:10:48.980" style="s2">Podcast about that because I answered that question for about two hours in Australia because people kept asking me about question</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.980" end="00:10:52.339" style="s2">which I really don&#39;t like I don&#39;t like that question and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.980" end="00:10:58.789" style="s2">So I hadn&#39;t thought about it for a good while and I tried to figure out why and and then I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.150" end="00:11:07.699" style="s2">He said you believe you see I thought who would have the audacity to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.180" end="00:11:10.890" style="s2">claim</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.890" end="00:11:12.890" style="s2">That they believed in God</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.530" end="00:11:14.670" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.670" end="00:11:16.699" style="s2">They examined the way they lived</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.730" end="00:11:19.730" style="s2">Who would dare say that?</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:24.379" style="s2">To to believe you think to believe in a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.990" end="00:11:28.760" style="s2">Actually, this is why Nietzsche said there was only ever one Christian and that was Christ</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.660" end="00:11:33.350" style="s2">To have the audacity to claim that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:36.680" style="s2">means that you live it out fully and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.710" end="00:11:40.549" style="s2">That&#39;s an that&#39;s an unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.190" end="00:11:46.010" style="s2">Task in some sense. I just debated to Tsavo Asia</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.740" end="00:11:49.250" style="s2">About a week ago, although it wasn&#39;t really much of a debate</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.290" end="00:11:51.349" style="s2">It was it was a strange event</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.570" end="00:11:56.779" style="s2">But he said something very brilliant and to me that justified the entire event at least from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.930" end="00:11:59.930" style="s2">He talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.120" end="00:12:02.870" style="s2">Christ&#39;s moment of crisis on the cross when he</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.140" end="00:12:09.979" style="s2">cried out to God that he had been Forsaken and what Dziedzic said was that what that meant was that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:13.490" style="s2">the conditions of human existence are so</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.490" end="00:12:15.930" style="s2">tragic</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.930" end="00:12:18.380" style="s2">That even God himself in human form</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.279" end="00:12:23.419" style="s2">Lost faith for a moment in the goodness of being</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.450" end="00:12:27.589" style="s2">and I thought that was a remarkable observation because</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.260" end="00:12:31.700" style="s2">Well, if God Himself would lose faith under such conditions</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.670" end="00:12:35.029" style="s2">What would you expect from normal human beings?</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.970" end="00:12:38.810" style="s2">confronted with what we&#39;re confronted by and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.860" end="00:12:48.630" style="s2">To be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.630" end="00:12:50.130" style="s2">accept</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.130" end="00:12:56.330" style="s2">the structure of existence the suffering that goes along with it and the disappointment and the betray land and -</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.700" end="00:12:59.539" style="s2">Nonetheless act properly right to aim it the good</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:07.400" style="s2">with all your heart right - to dispense with the malevolence and your desire for destruction and revenge and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.800" end="00:13:10.219" style="s2">to face things courageously and to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.070" end="00:13:14.689" style="s2">To speak the truth and to act it out. That&#39;s what it means to believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:23.419" style="s2">That&#39;s what it means it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t mean to state it it means to act it out and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.930" end="00:13:30.919" style="s2">Unless you act it out. You should be very careful about claiming it and so I&#39;ve never been comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.890" end="00:13:33.890" style="s2">saying anything other than I</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.589" end="00:13:36.919" style="s2">try to act as if God exists because</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:41.248" style="s2">god only knows what you&#39;d be if you truly believed I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.489" end="00:13:44.669" style="s2">Mean if you think about it in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.339" end="00:13:51.058" style="s2">that&#39;s the central idea in Christianity is that if you were capable of believing, it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.790" end="00:13:53.790" style="s2">transfiguring event a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.829" end="00:13:57.659" style="s2">Truly transfigure event and I know people experience that to one degree or another</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.059" end="00:14:00.389" style="s2">But we have no idea what the limit of that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.389" end="00:14:06.178" style="s2">we have no idea what the possibility is within each person if they lived a life that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.329" end="00:14:10.019" style="s2">maximally courageous and maximally truthful</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.600" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">You know because maybe you&#39;re running that 60 percent or 70 percent or twenty percent and at cross-purposes to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.489" end="00:14:21.269" style="s2">God only knows what you&#39;d be if you believed</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.970" end="00:14:23.970" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.059" end="00:14:28.379" style="s2">Well I act I try to act like I believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.049" end="00:14:31.259" style="s2">But I&#39;d never claim that I manage it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.899" end="00:14:35.548" style="s2">Because it&#39;s too it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot to manage</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.429" end="00:14:43.649" style="s2">properly and you have to be careful about claiming to manage things that you can&#39;t manage and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.350" end="00:14:48.569" style="s2">That&#39;s part of the answer to that question. It&#39;s a great answer as it happens</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.310" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">Like you to react to something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:05.830" style="s2">Is very operative in my life. I just and if you I always tell people on my radio showing</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.620" end="00:15:13.719" style="s2">Totally feel free. He&#39;d say sorry. I really don&#39;t don&#39;t find that tenable or whatever you however you want to react</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:20.949" style="s2">Am I my route as an adult to God has been completely circuitous</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.950" end="00:15:23.799" style="s2">I have come through the the back door. I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:28.540" style="s2">Wrote 25 years ago how I found God at Columbia. I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:37.239" style="s2">realized in the 70s at graduate school at Columbia that I was being taught nonsense literally nonsense things that made no sense and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.089" end="00:15:42.669" style="s2">It drove me crazy because they were all bright bright people taught me nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.700" end="00:15:50.859" style="s2">One day walking through Columbia. The only time I ever had I wouldn&#39;t say I never had a theophany, but I did have an epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.860" end="00:15:57.279" style="s2">all of a sudden one of the verses from my yeshiva education in Brooklyn, New York the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.380" style="s2">Cloistered Orthodox world of my childhood and I don&#39;t use cloistered and I don&#39;t like clustered</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.380" end="00:16:05.469" style="s2">But I&#39;m not using it at a pejorative way. I&#39;m just explaining what I had and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:12.010" style="s2">All of a sudden one of the verses that we said every morning in kindergarten first grade and second grade</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.529" end="00:16:19.299" style="s2">For the first time since second grade came to my brain rashid lafayette other than my wisdom begins with fear of the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.600" end="00:16:25.930" style="s2">Changed my life. There&#39;s no wisdom at Columbia because there&#39;s no God at Columbia and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.510" end="00:16:28.310" style="s2">That has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.310" end="00:16:30.310" style="s2">That is one of the ways I knew Oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.890" end="00:16:33.729" style="s2">Without God. Look what happens without God</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.730" end="00:16:41.079" style="s2">look what happens morally intellectually in terms of wisdom, and I my biggest reasons for belief in God are</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.750" end="00:16:43.750" style="s2">Watching what happens when people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.450" end="00:16:46.599" style="s2">So I&#39;d love to have your reaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.410" end="00:17:01.450" style="s2">If you cease to believe in God you&#39;ll start to believe in anything that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.970" end="00:17:07.780" style="s2">Was the British tested and yet just thank you. Yeah. Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.299" end="00:17:11.319" style="s2">That&#39;s a good that&#39;s a good way of looking at it. I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.900" end="00:17:13.900" style="s2">mean if</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">Catholicism, you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:22.689" style="s2">I&#39;ve gone through lots of Catholic cathedrals in Europe. And of course, they&#39;re stunning creations and but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.449" end="00:17:27.759" style="s2">gothic and strange and the doctrine is eerie, and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.410" end="00:17:36.759" style="s2">Complex and surreal and and and the biblical writings are the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.320" end="00:17:42.309" style="s2">You think of a book like revelation for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.150" end="00:17:47.739" style="s2">But I think that the Catholicism that&#39;s as sane as people can get</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.160" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:57.339" style="s2">Broadly speaking is that you we need a metaphysic a narrative metaphysic to hold us together</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.250" end="00:18:00.250" style="s2">and it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.710" end="00:18:03.309" style="s2">Predicated on something that&#39;s transcendent and absolute</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:08.349" style="s2">And if you lose that then you&#39;ll fall for something else</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.809" end="00:18:15.009" style="s2">you&#39;ll fall for something else or you&#39;ll fall for nothing which is which is no better and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:19.870" style="s2">I learned that from reading Nietzsche and I learned that from reading Dostoevsky and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">This is the problem with the rationalists like Sam Harrison and and and the atheists Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.100" end="00:18:32.709" style="s2">Now they believe that if we dispensed with our superstitions, we&#39;d all become</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.860" end="00:18:35.860" style="s2">Harris and Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.700" end="00:18:39.700" style="s2">Rational beings</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">Devoted towards the good</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.650" end="00:18:50.349" style="s2">However, we conceptualize that for rational reasons and I don&#39;t believe that because I don&#39;t believe that we are rational beings fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.350" end="00:18:52.059" style="s2">I think we&#39;re deeply irrational</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.059" end="00:18:56.199" style="s2">It&#39;s amazing that we can all sit in this room together without tearing ourselves into shreds</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.360" end="00:19:03.069" style="s2">And I mean that it&#39;s really quite a remarkable thing that all of us who&#39;ve come from all over</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.650" end="00:19:10.959" style="s2">North America can sit here so peacefully and concentrate on a single thing without any tension or trouble</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.330" end="00:19:14.470" style="s2">The the improbability of that should not be underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.380" end="00:19:18.549" style="s2">The the unlikelihood that that might be the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.900" end="00:19:25.269" style="s2">and then the issue of God as well is that there has to be something a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.150" end="00:19:27.920" style="s2">fundamental worth</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.920" end="00:19:30.849" style="s2">There is something that you consider a fundamental worth</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.880" end="00:19:33.650" style="s2">You know what? I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.650" end="00:19:35.059" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.059" end="00:19:40.899" style="s2">regard for other people for the consciousness of other people for the conscious being of other people is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.650" end="00:19:44.889" style="s2">Is is in that realm</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.920" end="00:19:47.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:53.530" style="s2">Have a relationship with yourself if you&#39;re going to be able to love someone else if you&#39;re going to be able to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.530" end="00:19:54.980" style="s2">Your family and your community</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.980" end="00:19:56.980" style="s2">you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.990" end="00:19:59.469" style="s2">attribute to human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.620" end="00:20:02.620" style="s2">a value that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.830" end="00:20:09.790" style="s2">Might as well be described as divine given that it has to be the the ultimate value that you hold and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.550" end="00:20:17.800" style="s2">I see it seems to me that it&#39;s not unreasonable to associate that value that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.230" end="00:20:21.189" style="s2">Intrinsic in humanity with something. That&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.890" end="00:20:27.160" style="s2">Metaphysically that&#39;s metaphysically real that&#39;s part of the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:30.010" style="s2">itself and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.140" end="00:20:32.890" style="s2">My sense has been that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.220" end="00:20:36.220" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.230" end="00:20:38.230" style="s2">It makes</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.950" end="00:20:43.990" style="s2">If you watch how people act when they&#39;re acting properly</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.260" end="00:20:47.499" style="s2">the hypothesis that there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:51.189" style="s2">Divinity within us that reflects</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.610" end="00:20:54.610" style="s2">divinity itself is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.860" end="00:20:58.809" style="s2">the only conclusion that makes sense that works and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.990" end="00:21:03.640" style="s2">so I think the evidence I think the evidence suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:09.369" style="s2">You know, you said you look look what happens when societies lose their bearings. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.980" end="00:21:14.860" style="s2">Yeah you that&#39;s what convinced me to the degree that I became a religious person</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.860" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">I didn&#39;t wasn&#39;t as if I discovered God it was more like I discovered Satan discovered the devil and certainly believed</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.010" end="00:21:24.010" style="s2">that very powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.770" end="00:21:25.540" style="s2">metaphysically or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.540" end="00:21:29.409" style="s2">You don&#39;t have to read that much about what happened in Nazi Germany or what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:35.050" style="s2">The Soviet Union or what happened in Mao&#39;s China what continues to happen in many places around the world?</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.270" end="00:21:38.560" style="s2">to be convinced that there&#39;s a great darkness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.170" end="00:21:43.899" style="s2">it seems to me that if there&#39;s a great darkness then there has to be a great light and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.320" end="00:21:47.320" style="s2">the first part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.380" end="00:21:51.819" style="s2">True beyond any hope of refutation and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.370" end="00:21:56.500" style="s2">The second seems to be a logical necessity in the light of the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.560" end="00:22:04.990" style="s2">It&#39;s a powerful line that you you know, I feel so obviously the same I want to talk to you about the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.510" end="00:22:07.510" style="s2">so I&#39;ve often said</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.610" end="00:22:09.610" style="s2">all of my life really that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.550" end="00:22:11.720" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.720" end="00:22:17.350" style="s2">Have a wrong metaphor in calling evil dark because it&#39;s it&#39;s actually so bright</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.870" end="00:22:19.870" style="s2">That people can stare it in the face</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.870" end="00:22:23.049" style="s2">the number of Canadian or American</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.290" end="00:22:30.970" style="s2">students at the most prestigious universities who could identify Pol Pot or even the Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:35.769" style="s2">Let alone the Great Leap Forward in China is so small</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.430" end="00:22:53.409" style="s2">At Berkeley I was had a dialogue with two leftist students</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.020" end="00:22:59.590" style="s2">My last question to them was do you believe people are basically good and they said yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.590" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">And I said, it&#39;s so demonstrably wrong that belief</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.820" end="00:23:11.620" style="s2">That there&#39;s only one possible explanation for why you hold it because you live in such a good country</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.040" end="00:23:19.090" style="s2">yeah, well, that&#39;s the that&#39;s the goodness of naivety right and it&#39;s something that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.720" end="00:23:24.100" style="s2">Encouraged, you know you encourage that by</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.510" end="00:23:32.530" style="s2">Producing safe spaces around people you produce that by sheltering them you want to preserve that childlike?</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.410" end="00:23:37.540" style="s2">Innocence but once you&#39;re no longer a child, it&#39;s not childlike. It&#39;s just childish</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:46.209" style="s2">And that&#39;s that&#39;s not good to be a 40 year old child and to think that people are fundamentally good. It&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.790" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">Good is very difficult?</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.580" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">It&#39;s by no means the default position. What&#39;s the default position entropy?</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.920" end="00:24:02.529" style="s2">Catastrophe tragedy malevolence and death that&#39;s the default position the good struggles up against that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:10.389" style="s2">That&#39;s no easy thing to manage to think of that is intrinsic. It&#39;s an intrinsic possibility, but it&#39;s not something that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.650" end="00:24:14.650" style="s2">It&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.870" end="00:24:21.459" style="s2">It&#39;s not something that you can manifest without faith and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.770" end="00:24:27.490" style="s2">commitment and and the more faith and the more commitment the better and the deeper the better and it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.620" end="00:24:30.819" style="s2">difficult of things to do and and it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.670" end="00:24:38.920" style="s2">It&#39;s appalling to teach people the alternative and I know that speaking I think speak of this clinically</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.590" end="00:24:41.330" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.330" end="00:24:46.179" style="s2">The people who are most prone to post-traumatic stress disorder are naive people</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.210" end="00:24:51.970" style="s2">This is well known clinically. It&#39;s there&#39;s nothing about this. That&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.110" end="00:24:57.849" style="s2">It&#39;s questionable or for unorthodox</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.930" end="00:25:02.860" style="s2">If you believe that people are basically good and that the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.130" end="00:25:05.150" style="s2">rewards</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.150" end="00:25:11.710" style="s2">goodness with good in return if that&#39;s your fundamental belief that there&#39;s not really any such thing as evil and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.230" end="00:25:15.880" style="s2">You encounter someone malevolent, which could be yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.750" end="00:25:24.399" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s often what happens to people who develop post-traumatic stress disorder, you know, they&#39;re there it&#39;s very common that people</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.010" end="00:25:28.120" style="s2">develop PTSD because they&#39;ve done something so</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.730" end="00:25:30.170" style="s2">incomprehensibly</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.170" end="00:25:33.639" style="s2">Morally repugnant that it&#39;s damaged them</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.220" end="00:25:39.459" style="s2">Psycho physiologically and they cannot recover. It&#39;s very common among soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.460" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">It&#39;s not what they saw. Although sometimes it is it&#39;s what they did</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.110" end="00:25:48.819" style="s2">They have no framework within which to conceptualize it</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.820" end="00:25:51.580" style="s2">If you have no theory of evil</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.580" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">if you have no theory of good and evil, if you have no metaphysics and someone malevolent touches you you&#39;re done and</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.480" end="00:26:01.370" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.370" end="00:26:03.350" style="s2">telling people that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.350" end="00:26:07.059" style="s2">Human beings are basically good and that evil doesn&#39;t exist makes them</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.060" end="00:26:11.169" style="s2">ripe fruit for the picking by the malevolent and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.170" end="00:26:15.820" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing about that that&#39;s positive. It&#39;s mere</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.700" end="00:26:24.220" style="s2">Cowardice masquerading as virtue. It&#39;s the devouring mother and from the Freudian perspective. I&#39;ll keep you innocent</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.280" end="00:26:31.690" style="s2">I&#39;ll keep you young and naive and nothing will ever come to harm you it&#39;s like precisely the opposite is the case in life</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.260" end="00:26:36.940" style="s2">That is why by the way, I truly yep</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.749" end="00:26:44.749" style="s2">That is why I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.820" end="00:26:52.369" style="s2">truly believe that a 12 year old at a traditional Christian or a Jewish school is wiser and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.340" end="00:26:59.329" style="s2">More likely to be happy than a secular professor of philosophy who is 50 years old</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.059" end="00:27:07.969" style="s2">Just because I knew I went again to yeshiva all the so half the day in Hebrew Jewish studies have today in English secular</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.970" end="00:27:13.699" style="s2">Studies I knew at 6 people were not basically good because God said so in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.830" end="00:27:16.970" style="s2">When he decided to destroy the world because it turned out rotten</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.399" end="00:27:22.368" style="s2">so I knew at the earliest possible age people were not basically good and it not only</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.859" end="00:27:25.099" style="s2">Affected my felt and show my worldview</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.100" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">It made me happy because then I realized wow</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.019" end="00:27:32.899" style="s2">I&#39;m eating good people despite the fact that people about basically good</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.899" end="00:27:36.319" style="s2">I really do it but people in my life am I lucky or what?</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.499" end="00:27:41.479" style="s2">Yeah. Yeah. Well that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really good. That&#39;s a really good point because</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.509" end="00:27:46.189" style="s2">You see when I said that it was a miracle that we can all sit here peacefully</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:48.678" style="s2">Like that is how I look at it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.679" end="00:27:52.878" style="s2">I think every day when I walk out into the world and it&#39;s not rack and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.100" end="00:27:59.359" style="s2">Runes and flames and floods that it&#39;s a bloody miracle. It was I mean it that we hold this together</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.359" end="00:28:07.129" style="s2">It&#39;s not an easy thing to do and release to think of pace as the default position is a form of deep insanity</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:14.029" style="s2">like it&#39;s it requires work to do to to maintain peace and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.580" end="00:28:16.580" style="s2">You can&#39;t be properly grateful</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.070" end="00:28:21.259" style="s2">Unless you understand how unlikely it is that?</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:28.189" style="s2">Well, we&#39;re not in the throes of World War 3. We&#39;re not still in the depths of World War 2</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.980" end="00:28:36.829" style="s2">that the Cold War is mostly over that the economic conditions of people everywhere on the planet are improving at a rate that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.529" end="00:28:44.659" style="s2">could only be described as miraculous and that most things are going in a positive direction if you assume that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.970" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">Normative, then you think well, that&#39;s life. But and you have no reason to to be wide-eyed</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.639" end="00:28:58.379" style="s2">To have your eyes wide open admiration and gratitude at the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.650" end="00:29:03.780" style="s2">the worst which is frequently manifested itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.870" end="00:29:07.260" style="s2">Knocking at your door at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.050" end="00:29:12.450" style="s2">Because that&#39;s the story of humanity and not peace and prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.810" end="00:29:18.749" style="s2">So here we have it and here we should preserve it and here we should spread it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.940" end="00:29:24.779" style="s2">We should do everything we can to live in a manner that makes that most likely and we should do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:30.119" style="s2">Because well you said what did you say fear of God? It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.780" end="00:29:33.450" style="s2">Throughout the Old Testament, you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.450" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">It&#39;s one story after another is that people develop?</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:44.370" style="s2">Societies and they become arrogant and they wander off the path. And as soon as they wander off the path all hell breaks loose and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.120" end="00:29:53.460" style="s2">If you&#39;re fortunate enough to be where all hell isn&#39;t breaking loose you should do everything you can to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:55.740" style="s2">help ensure that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.470" end="00:29:59.670" style="s2">Stay the course and walk the straight and narrow path</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.940" end="00:30:02.940" style="s2">so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.760" end="00:30:12.919" style="s2">So I have a very deep worry in light of our absolute</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.910" end="00:30:18.709" style="s2">Unanimity if you could speak of unanimity among two people, but</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:24.918" style="s2">we&#39;re so consonant in this this is shocking how good things are and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.890" end="00:30:33.109" style="s2">Yet in the United States and I follow Canada a lot but love to speak about America right now in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.690" end="00:30:40.220" style="s2">The United States half at least half of young people think they are living in a rotten society</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.850" end="00:30:43.850" style="s2">Sexist intolerant xenophobic homophobic</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.490" end="00:30:46.490" style="s2">Islamophobic racist bigoted</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.530" end="00:30:49.939" style="s2">That&#39;s six herb. That&#39;s my acronym for what I just said</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.179" end="00:30:53.989" style="s2">this is frightening to me and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.230" end="00:30:58.039" style="s2">I want to know is it frightening to you?</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">Well</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.650" end="00:31:07.400" style="s2">You know, I always try to give the devil his due and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.850" end="00:31:14.539" style="s2">the idea that the West is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.900" end="00:31:17.900" style="s2">oppressive patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.650" end="00:31:22.819" style="s2">Characterized by the sins that you just described</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.539" end="00:31:26.539" style="s2">It&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.419" end="00:31:32.449" style="s2">You know, there&#39;s if we look through our history personal or political</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.720" end="00:31:36.140" style="s2">There&#39;s no shortage of things to be appalled by</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.130" end="00:31:40.130" style="s2">That&#39;s not the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.980" end="00:31:42.980" style="s2">Exactly, or that&#39;s not the issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.400" end="00:31:46.400" style="s2">The issue is compared to what</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.880" end="00:31:51.260" style="s2">No, I was Churchill this time I&#39;ve got this right</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.260" end="00:31:55.849" style="s2">It was Churchill who said that democracy is the worst form of government</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.669" end="00:32:02.209" style="s2">except for all the other forms of government and I would say that about our societies is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.960" end="00:32:11.720" style="s2">There&#39;s no we have every reason to be awake and cognizant of our errors</p>

<p begin="00:32:18.510" end="00:32:20.510" style="s2">But</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">Compared to how it could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.600" end="00:32:27.490" style="s2">And now it has been in many places and how it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.340" end="00:32:29.630" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:34.150" style="s2">Everywhere in the world and how it was for much of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.460" end="00:32:38.110" style="s2">things are so good here that it&#39;s absolutely beyond comprehension and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.230" end="00:32:41.230" style="s2">So along with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.620" end="00:32:45.130" style="s2">Careful awareness of the flaws of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.650" end="00:32:52.209" style="s2">patriarchy let&#39;s say should be an unbelievable gratitude that we could wake up in the morning and</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.870" end="00:33:10.329" style="s2">that our children will live and that the probability that any one of us will die a violent death is negligible and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.660" end="00:33:17.439" style="s2">The thing that bothers me about one of the things that bothers me about the modern</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.250" end="00:33:25.989" style="s2">University is the absolute lack of gratitude that characterizes its teachings. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.110" end="00:33:32.500" style="s2">it&#39;s half the story, you know, it&#39;s like people are oppressed by Nature and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.470" end="00:33:39.130" style="s2">People are oppressed by culture and people are oppressed by their own dark Nate their own dark side</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.559" end="00:33:41.739" style="s2">It&#39;s an existential reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.960" end="00:33:47.860" style="s2">But you have to you have to balance that you have to understand that nature has its benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.140" end="00:33:54.520" style="s2">element and that&#39;s what&#39;s giving you life and you have to be grateful for your culture for everything that it&#39;s provided to you and you</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.350" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">There&#39;s a damnable shortage of gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:13.179" style="s2">in the modern Academy and that&#39;s based on a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.730" end="00:34:15.610" style="s2">naivety or a resentment</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.610" end="00:34:23.139" style="s2">That&#39;s so deep that it&#39;s almost in comprehending a naivety and a resentment and a willful blindness to the reality of history</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.139" end="00:34:25.179" style="s2">That&#39;s so deep that it&#39;s almost incomprehensible</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.790" end="00:35:12.969" style="s2">Yeah taking away the STEM fields. I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.820" end="00:35:15.820" style="s2">think that universities</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:18.310" style="s2">Not colleges necessarily. I</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.970" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">Think that universities do more harm than good now that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.390" end="00:35:24.830" style="s2">and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.830" end="00:35:27.279" style="s2">loath to say that, you know because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.830" end="00:35:32.349" style="s2">Part of the Academy for thirty years and taught it great</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.020" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.160" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.940" end="00:35:42.040" style="s2">The postmodern collectivist doctrine is so</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.180" end="00:35:46.180" style="s2">Psychologically and politically toxic</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.780" end="00:35:50.109" style="s2">That I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.130" end="00:35:54.730" style="s2">Academia now does more harm than good and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.420" end="00:36:00.550" style="s2">It&#39;s not only what it teaches which is the ideology this ungrateful</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.550" end="00:36:04.599" style="s2">ideology which denies the existence of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.230" end="00:36:09.310" style="s2">One of the things I might tell you just so you know, this is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.849" end="00:36:15.579" style="s2">You know that you hear that there are debates about free speech on campus</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.730" end="00:36:20.290" style="s2">About who should talk and who shouldn&#39;t and people think that&#39;s what the debate is about</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:26.080" style="s2">About who should talk and who shouldn&#39;t but that&#39;s not what the debate of it is about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.270" end="00:36:29.800" style="s2">You don&#39;t even scraping the surface of the debate if that&#39;s what you think. It&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.369" end="00:36:37.269" style="s2">The debate on campus is about whether or not a human being has the capacity to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.690" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">intelligibly as an individual or not and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.930" end="00:36:49.539" style="s2">the answer for the postmodernist collective types is that there is no such thing as an individual and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.420" end="00:36:53.470" style="s2">Therefore the very notion of free speech is absurd</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.779" end="00:36:59.109" style="s2">Because free speech is predicated on the idea that each of us have something to say, that&#39;s ours</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.450" end="00:37:06.250" style="s2">That&#39;s a consequence of our unique individuality not our group identity or or the multiplicity of our group identities</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.250" end="00:37:08.259" style="s2">but something that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.690" end="00:37:15.609" style="s2">something that we have that speaks from our spirit that can speak to the spirit of another and produce a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:17.180" style="s2">negotiated</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.180" end="00:37:18.980" style="s2">peace and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.980" end="00:37:21.369" style="s2">That&#39;s what&#39;s being debated</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.609" end="00:37:24.609" style="s2">That the war that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.309" end="00:37:32.619" style="s2">philosophically or theologically in the campuses is far deeper than you think it no the entire notion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:38.680" style="s2">the reality of the individual which is I think also the entire notion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.140" end="00:37:43.869" style="s2">The idea that human beings are made in the image of God most fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.029" end="00:37:49.089" style="s2">That is what&#39;s being attacked. It wasn&#39;t for nothing that Derrida</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.150" end="00:37:55.000" style="s2">called Western culture FAL logo centric phallus for</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.369" end="00:38:03.189" style="s2">Masculine logos for logos for truth and courage and centric for centric that was a criticism from his perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.190" end="00:38:08.829" style="s2">the idea of the sovereignty of the individual if you don&#39;t have the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.900" end="00:38:12.250" style="s2">Sovereignty of the individual because there&#39;s no individual. There&#39;s no free. Speech</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.410" end="00:38:18.460" style="s2">All you are is an avatar of your group interests, and if I&#39;m not in your group</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.460" end="00:38:20.799" style="s2">It&#39;s not in my interest to let you speak</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.619" end="00:38:25.538" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing that we have to say to one another there&#39;s nothing but power</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.930" end="00:38:29.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a Hobbesian nightmare of group against group and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.619" end="00:38:32.619" style="s2">That&#39;s the postmodern doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.170" end="00:38:34.250" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.250" end="00:38:42.039" style="s2">it&#39;s to call it appalling is to barely scrape the surface it&#39;s it&#39;s an assault it is it is truly an</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.470" end="00:38:48.519" style="s2">assault on the most fundamental principles by which the West is governed it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.670" end="00:38:54.009" style="s2">Surface level philosophy, it goes all the way to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.890" end="00:38:58.210" style="s2">this is partly why I&#39;ve been concentrating on religious themes in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.450" end="00:39:01.130" style="s2">lectures say</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.130" end="00:39:04.660" style="s2">Because the argument goes all the way down to first principles</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:08.570" style="s2">Is</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.570" end="00:39:10.040" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.040" end="00:39:14.349" style="s2">The in is the idea of the sovereignty of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.349" end="00:39:17.349" style="s2">Correct</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.320" end="00:39:25.840" style="s2">The Western answer is it&#39;s the great discovery of the West the Western answer is that&#39;s the most fundamental truth that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.060" end="00:39:31.659" style="s2">Exactly, what&#39;s under assault at the universities? The reason that the collectivist types hate me is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.210" end="00:39:36.520" style="s2">Because I&#39;ve got their number. I know what they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.700" end="00:39:47.360" style="s2">And I think I think further that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.710" end="00:39:57.020" style="s2">They do not wish to shoulder the unbearable responsibility of being a sovereign individual</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.350" end="00:40:00.350" style="s2">So not only is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.710" end="00:40:05.940" style="s2">And</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.940" end="00:40:12.289" style="s2">That accounts for the cowardice and that accounts for the attempt to weaken the spirit of the people that they&#39;re teaching</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.420" end="00:40:14.420" style="s2">by over protecting them</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.510" end="00:40:19.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not willing to take on the responsibility and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">Fault has to lie elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.990" end="00:40:23.990" style="s2">And I think that&#39;s a good judge of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:26.190" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.190" end="00:40:28.399" style="s2">Someone&#39;s character in general. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.850" end="00:40:32.600" style="s2">Well, the world is in the messy State. Let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:38.120" style="s2">And the question is whose fault is it an answer is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.570" end="00:40:41.570" style="s2">yours</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.820" end="00:40:46.729" style="s2">That&#39;s the right answer it&#39;s not the patriarchy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.150" end="00:40:54.170" style="s2">Some identifiable group. It&#39;s not some structure that&#39;s gone wrong, even though those things can go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:40:56.930" style="s2">And that&#39;s the other fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.390" end="00:40:59.390" style="s2">truth of the West is</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.030" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:04.460" style="s2">things would be a lot better if you were a lot better and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.130" end="00:41:11.989" style="s2">Have to decide if you&#39;re willing to accept that and and you have every reason not to it&#39;s a terrible thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.800" end="00:41:15.060" style="s2">Don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.060" end="00:41:19.070" style="s2">With Solzhenitsyn, I think this is a paraphrase, but it&#39;s close enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.140" end="00:41:23.269" style="s2">he said that one person who stopped lying could bring down a tyranny and that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.700" end="00:41:26.660" style="s2">When I first read that I thought that can&#39;t possibly be true</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.660" end="00:41:33.019" style="s2">and as I understood it, I thought that can&#39;t possibly not be true because the only thing that can</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:38.509" style="s2">break, the spine of a tyranny is the truth and the only person that and the only</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.750" end="00:41:43.250" style="s2">Way that the truth can be told is that some individual tells it?</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:48.259" style="s2">And so it&#39;s necessarily the case that tyranny is broken by the truth of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.660" end="00:41:52.099" style="s2">But then the question is well, is it going to be you that&#39;s going to do that?</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.500" end="00:41:55.939" style="s2">It&#39;s no trivial thing, you know people come and tell me</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.000" end="00:42:00.500" style="s2">Very frequently and they write me and they say well, you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.500" end="00:42:04.100" style="s2">I agree with what you say and this terrible thing is happening in my workplace</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.100" end="00:42:06.980" style="s2">And you know, I don&#39;t know what to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.980" end="00:42:12.740" style="s2">And I don&#39;t want you to make my story public and because of the potential for repercussions and I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.740" end="00:42:16.099" style="s2">Well, I mean, I understand your position. It&#39;s no joke -</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.710" end="00:42:19.939" style="s2">it&#39;s no joke - stand up when when when</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.730" end="00:42:24.859" style="s2">When the when the amateur totalitarians are knocking on your office door</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.700" end="00:42:31.519" style="s2">But if you don&#39;t then sooner sooner than you think it&#39;ll be the professional</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:39.259" style="s2">Totalitarians and then you&#39;ll be in this sort of trouble that that unless you&#39;ve tried to imagine it you can&#39;t possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.500" end="00:42:43.550" style="s2">so in the minutes remaining</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.790" end="00:42:47.720" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna ask you a few personal questions</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.020" end="00:42:54.380" style="s2">As I did with the late great Charles Krauthammer at one of our weekend&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.580" end="00:43:01.190" style="s2">Because people like including me just fascinated belicus. So here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:04.849" style="s2">What was the city in Alberta you grew up in?</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.550" end="00:43:09.350" style="s2">Well, it wasn&#39;t a city exactly. Okay little town</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.140" end="00:43:12.140" style="s2">It&#39;s called Fairview</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.540" end="00:43:18.650" style="s2">It&#39;s about 800 miles north of the American border. So it&#39;s a long ways up there. Right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:23.659" style="s2">How often if at all that do you think?</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.450" end="00:43:28.819" style="s2">when people stop you at airports and you go around the world lecturing</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.290" end="00:43:33.290" style="s2">Jordan Peterson from Fairview</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.780" end="00:43:35.780" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.850" end="00:43:37.850" style="s2">Does that happen?</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.890" end="00:43:40.700" style="s2">Well, I live I live in a constant state of disbelief</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.390" end="00:43:42.630" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.630" end="00:43:46.279" style="s2">I&#39;m dead serious about this like I think it&#39;s a form of post-traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.220" end="00:43:52.579" style="s2">Post-traumatic shock in some sense. I mean my life in the last three years has been</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.790" end="00:43:55.530" style="s2">just a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.530" end="00:43:57.530" style="s2">continuous series of surreal</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.440" end="00:44:02.089" style="s2">Impossibilities. I mean on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.060" end="00:44:06.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved in a political scandal of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.650" end="00:44:10.849" style="s2">For a good year and a half. It was at least twice a week</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.780" end="00:44:17.989" style="s2">And then for the entire three year period it&#39;s been at least once a week. It&#39;s nonstop and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.570" end="00:44:20.570" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s national and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.820" end="00:44:22.820" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s international but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.160" end="00:44:25.160" style="s2">continual and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.000" end="00:44:29.540" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you an example. This is a funny little story</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.810" end="00:44:32.810" style="s2">my son came over one day about</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.600" end="00:44:35.340" style="s2">year-and-a-half ago</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.340" end="00:44:41.659" style="s2">And I was having a kind of a rough day because 200 of my colleagues at the University had signed a document</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.540" end="00:44:44.540" style="s2">trying to get me fired and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.730" end="00:44:50.900" style="s2">Then they gave it to the Union and and the Union presented it to the administration without even informing me</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.330" end="00:44:55.039" style="s2">Even though I&#39;m part of the faculty union, and so I said to my son</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.950" end="00:44:57.660" style="s2">Julian</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.660" end="00:45:03.860" style="s2">you know 200 of my colleagues today just signed a letter saying that I should be fired and he said oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.440" end="00:45:07.250" style="s2">Dad, don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about that. It was only 200</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.130" end="00:45:16.459" style="s2">And I thought well that&#39;s where we were out, you know, it was like, oh that&#39;s not that&#39;s nuts</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.460" end="00:45:18.460" style="s2">That&#39;s a that was a light day</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.870" end="00:45:20.870" style="s2">I was ok, you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.060" end="00:45:26.600" style="s2">And then so there&#39;s that and and the fact that it doesn&#39;t quit. That&#39;s another thing. I can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.600" end="00:45:31.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like, you know all this blew up around me around Bill c16 and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:37.610" style="s2">well, I&#39;ve had my 15 minutes or mine then it was like well, I&#39;ve had my week and then it was like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.550" end="00:45:40.550" style="s2">must have had my month and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.670" end="00:45:47.480" style="s2">but none of that happened it just kept expanding and expanding and expanding and expanding and expanding and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.330" end="00:45:54.409" style="s2">every day I wake up and I think well this is gonna come to an end, but it doesn&#39;t it just expands and</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.930" end="00:46:02.030" style="s2">and that just doesn&#39;t seem credible in the least every time I come to an event like this or I mean when I was in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.190" end="00:46:05.450" style="s2">Australia I was speaking to audiences of</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.910" end="00:46:08.930" style="s2">5,500 people and it&#39;s like how in the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.930" end="00:46:10.930" style="s2">can you believe that it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.190" end="00:46:17.330" style="s2">you heard what I just said who there who in their right mind would come and listen to someone who just told you what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.330" end="00:46:24.259" style="s2">told you you know, it&#39;s so dark and it&#39;s so demanding you wouldn&#39;t think that people would</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:32.419" style="s2">Line for blocks and spend their hard-earned money and and come because it&#39;s a like a marital</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.730" end="00:46:34.710" style="s2">anniversary</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.710" end="00:46:41.179" style="s2">That&#39;s what they say. This was our anniversary present to each other. I thank you people you my you&#39;re completely out of your mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.580" end="00:46:49.189" style="s2">And so and then I think to you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.860" end="00:46:55.519" style="s2">That the state of disbelief is necessary and maybe that&#39;s an advantage to being older</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.740" end="00:47:01.939" style="s2">Because I&#39;m too old to adapt rapidly and this isn&#39;t the sort of thing that you should adapt to right</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.940" end="00:47:08.450" style="s2">I should be in a constant state of shock disbelief because it keeps my head on straight. I</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.000" end="00:47:16.550" style="s2">Don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. Exactly. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s the case that what I&#39;m saying is so necessary</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.610" end="00:47:21.979" style="s2">Apparently but it seems to be and I&#39;m trying to figure out why</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.950" end="00:47:28.490" style="s2">But I&#39;m certainly not for a second. I think I take very little for granted</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.500" end="00:47:32.540" style="s2">And I mean, I think I take even less for granted than you might think</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.580" end="00:47:37.669" style="s2">I told you that I don&#39;t take it for granted that you can all sit here peacefully, you know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.270" end="00:47:45.709" style="s2">And that is how I look at the world is that if it isn&#39;t if it isn&#39;t burning in rock and runes</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.170" end="00:47:48.500" style="s2">then I think it&#39;s a bloody miracle and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.020" end="00:47:52.399" style="s2">the fact that things have gone well for me and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.920" end="00:47:54.980" style="s2">That I&#39;m still standing</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.740" end="00:47:58.850" style="s2">which is also a miracle of sorts, you know, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.560" end="00:48:05.600" style="s2">There were probably 30 different scandalous</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.290" end="00:48:08.850" style="s2">Episodes</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.850" end="00:48:10.850" style="s2">that had every</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.220" end="00:48:15.439" style="s2">that anyone with any sense would have thought would finish me and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.790" end="00:48:19.790" style="s2">They&#39;ve all backfired and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.970" end="00:48:22.970" style="s2">that&#39;s all so</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.360" end="00:48:29.180" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.180" end="00:48:30.850" style="s2">Also don&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.850" end="00:48:37.989" style="s2">It&#39;s like I don&#39;t understand that I get attacked in new york times and my friends</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.030" end="00:48:40.810" style="s2">Call me who are New York Times readers and they say</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.270" end="00:48:45.699" style="s2">You you you you&#39;ve had it this time cuz that was the New York Times, you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.310" end="00:48:49.570" style="s2">You&#39;re not gonna recover from that and I think well, that&#39;s probably true</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.570" end="00:48:55.570" style="s2">I mean I was expecting it to happen all along and then I wait and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.390" end="00:48:58.779" style="s2">everybody clamors out me and then I</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.420" end="00:49:05.529" style="s2">don&#39;t respond too much to that and it starts to die away and then all the supporters come out and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.470" end="00:49:13.300" style="s2">Hundred people who clamor and ten thousand supporters and you know, here&#39;s something I can tell you about my life</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:16.660" style="s2">That&#39;s really remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.270" end="00:49:20.199" style="s2">so, you know if you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.230" end="00:49:23.230" style="s2">Read the press</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.050" end="00:49:27.340" style="s2">Well, you&#39;d have all sorts of ideas about me. I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.860" end="00:49:35.620" style="s2">You know that I&#39;m a bigot in the broadest possible sense. And so that&#39;s you know racist sexist homophobic</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:39.550" style="s2">Ethnocentric white nationalists. All right</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.980" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">All of those things</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.740" end="00:49:49.150" style="s2">And you&#39;d think that there was just nothing but hatred</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.150" end="00:49:52.989" style="s2">Although I have been treated well by many journalists</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.990" end="00:49:57.070" style="s2">But you you could easily get that sense that like I live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.560" end="00:50:01.060" style="s2">Where I&#39;m surrounded by hatred and that is absolutely not true</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.850" end="00:50:04.630" style="s2">it&#39;s so not true that that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.780" end="00:50:06.430" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.430" end="00:50:13.180" style="s2">There are lies and then there are there are there are anti truths then and an anti truth is even worse than a lie</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:17.229" style="s2">It&#39;s like the ultimate form of lie, and that is what my life is like at all</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.320" end="00:50:20.320" style="s2">what my life is like is that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.930" end="00:50:26.980" style="s2">Travel with my wife and wherever we go. And I mean that literally wherever we go</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.130" end="00:50:31.900" style="s2">We&#39;ve been to I don&#39;t know how many countries in the last year. It&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.860" end="00:50:38.769" style="s2">Don&#39;t know how many 30 40 many countries</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.040" end="00:50:42.040" style="s2">If I go down the street</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.220" end="00:50:46.959" style="s2">nor if I&#39;m in an airport, or if I&#39;m in a cafe or if I&#39;m in a movie theater, or if I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.170" end="00:50:50.170" style="s2">mechanic&#39;s shop</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.650" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">Some person comes up to me every 10 minutes and says I</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.900" end="00:51:02.290" style="s2">hope I&#39;m not disturbing you and they&#39;re very very polite and they say</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.260" end="00:51:10.989" style="s2">I&#39;ve been listening to your lectures or I&#39;ve been watching your YouTube videos or I read your book and I was in this dreadful place</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.140" end="00:51:14.770" style="s2">six months ago and then they tell me a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:20.589" style="s2">the particulars of that little corner of hell they were in sconce tin and then they say</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:25.569" style="s2">Well, I&#39;ve been trying to develop a vision for my life or I&#39;ve been trying to take more responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.300" end="00:51:28.569" style="s2">Are being trying to be grateful for my job</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.410" end="00:51:31.210" style="s2">Mundane though</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.210" end="00:51:37.300" style="s2">it may be or I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m going to try to put my family together and make peace and</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.610" end="00:51:43.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve really been trying and it&#39;s really working and things are way better and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.530" end="00:51:47.530" style="s2">Thank you</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.930" end="00:51:49.160" style="s2">And</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.160" end="00:51:50.690" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.690" end="00:51:57.730" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s so overwhelming to have that happen. Continually. It&#39;s very difficult to believe but</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.210" end="00:52:01.210" style="s2">It&#39;s unbelievably positive</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.550" end="00:52:08.919" style="s2">You know, I mean it&#39;s if you could imagine if you could ask for what you want today. You could have anything you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">You might think</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.290" end="00:52:22.119" style="s2">It would be lovely if I could give my life in a manner so that wherever I went in the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.540" end="00:52:29.529" style="s2">Perfect strangers would come up to me one after the other and tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.440" end="00:52:32.440" style="s2">They&#39;re suffering much less</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.870" end="00:52:34.870" style="s2">That their families are in better shape</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.390" end="00:52:38.500" style="s2">and that their lives are on course because they took</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.350" end="00:52:43.900" style="s2">They they took to heart some something that I was communicating</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.600" end="00:52:48.100" style="s2">That&#39;s as good as it gets as far as I could</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.609" end="00:53:09.609" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.209" end="00:53:14.839" style="s2">Had really I don&#39;t want to ask anything else</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.839" end="00:53:21.288" style="s2">I think this was so powerful and if that didn&#39;t prove my instinct is right</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.920" end="00:53:25.039" style="s2">Nothing will Georgie Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.829" end="00:53:32.298" style="s2">You are a good man. You are doing a lot of good. I thank God he made you</p>
