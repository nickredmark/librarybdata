<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">podcast livestream what we are now</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:25.890" style="s2">calling the post Joe Rogan experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">so we&#39;re calling it I don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:31.349" style="s2">seemed to me at that moment that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:34.469" style="s2">what we should call it but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.349" end="00:00:36.120" style="s2">we are here this is our 24th live stream</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.469" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">I am sitting with dr. Heather huiying</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.120" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">and there is as has been the case for</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">months now a lot going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">yep which is part of why we started</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:49.950" style="s2">doing these but first today is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:52.050" style="s2">Solstice it is the Solstice is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.950" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">solstice it is the summer solstice here</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.050" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">in the northern hemisphere the winter</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.300" style="s2">solstice for those few people who are</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:00:58.920" style="s2">watching and live in the southern</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.300" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">hemisphere meaning it&#39;s the longest day</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.920" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">of the year</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">it is the year during the moment during</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">which also our twilight&#39;s are actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">lasting longest as well for the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:14.090" style="s2">reason that&#39;s the longest day of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:17.130" style="s2">year so first day of astronomical summer</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.090" end="00:01:19.740" style="s2">historical midsummer so Shakespeare&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">Midsummer&#39;s Night&#39;s Dream was about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.740" end="00:01:23.549" style="s2">moment not a month and a half from now</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">yeah you alerted me to this fact before</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.549" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">I had not thought about it but it makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">a great deal of sense that what we call</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">summer would actually have moved and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">are now talking about in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">that we have altered the meaning of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:39.750" style="s2">to become like laboratory time rather</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">than time the way humans experience that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.750" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">we have altered summer to be this solar</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">solar definition rather than either</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">defining it around the way the seasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.680" style="s2">actually happened where you are or</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:54.210" style="s2">defining it where the maximal day length</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.680" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">would be the middle of that period we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.210" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">defined it where it starts at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">period where day legs begin to shorten</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">yeah are we I mean we could it could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:04.189" style="s2">defined midsummer could be the solstice</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">right and that would also be</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.189" end="00:02:09.660" style="s2">astronomically global I mean that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">be a truth that was applied to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.660" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">earth but you know this nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">seasonality is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:17.430" style="s2">varied depending on where you are on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">planet I remember growing up in LA as</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.430" end="00:02:21.769" style="s2">you did as well hearing these aphorisms</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:24.120" style="s2">like april showers bring May flowers</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.769" end="00:02:26.849" style="s2">thinking I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever rained</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.120" end="00:02:28.709" style="s2">in April in LA I used to shower in April</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.849" end="00:02:32.189" style="s2">yes you see if I could get flowers there</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.709" end="00:02:34.170" style="s2">and any effect nothing yeah the only you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.189" end="00:02:35.819" style="s2">know the seasonality in LA the Santa Ana</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.170" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">winds that come in and September and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.819" end="00:02:41.640" style="s2">October and start fires there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:44.129" style="s2">no aphorisms about that so summer</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.640" end="00:02:46.349" style="s2">solstice is a reality it&#39;s a it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.129" end="00:02:47.159" style="s2">solstice everywhere on the planet winter</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.349" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">solstice in the southern hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.159" end="00:02:52.349" style="s2">summer in the northern and and here we</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">are now the days get shorter but slowly</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.349" end="00:02:57.209" style="s2">but the days also get warmer for a while</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:59.489" style="s2">so all else be thoughts being equal this</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.209" end="00:03:03.329" style="s2">is the point where you have the maximum</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.489" end="00:03:05.670" style="s2">opportunity to produce vitamin D per per</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.329" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">day yes this is that point which ever</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.670" end="00:03:08.340" style="s2">more evidence suggests that that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:11.099" style="s2">something that you might want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:13.650" style="s2">doing right now given that it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.099" end="00:03:16.109" style="s2">be protective against coronavirus yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">it&#39;s something you should want to do for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.109" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">lots of reasons this makes you much</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.690" style="s2">healthier and less vulnerable in general</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:23.849" style="s2">but with respect to kovat 19 might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:26.549" style="s2">particularly important incidentally I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.849" end="00:03:28.609" style="s2">ran across something on this front as</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.549" end="00:03:31.650" style="s2">long as we&#39;re talking about daylight a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.609" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">recent paper reflects that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.650" end="00:03:35.819" style="s2">hypotheses that we advanced and talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:39.329" style="s2">about turns out to be right which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.819" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">that one of the reasons that czars co2</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.329" end="00:03:47.069" style="s2">is not transmitted outdoors as easily as</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">indoors in fact vastly less easy is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.069" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">apparently UV light is highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:54.780" style="s2">destructive of Sarrus co2 so we now know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">that for a fact which opens the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.780" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">possibility if that&#39;s the only factor</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">then it suggests that outdoors might not</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">be so safe at night whereas if it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:06.389" style="s2">of a couple of factors like we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:10.769" style="s2">about the other factor that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.389" end="00:04:13.079" style="s2">highly relevant is the airflow and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.769" end="00:04:15.540" style="s2">volume AB solute volume of the air in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.079" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">question so we&#39;re developing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.540" end="00:04:20.220" style="s2">model in which for some reason instead</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:22.500" style="s2">of a virus being able to get into you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:24.330" style="s2">and infect you there&#39;s some level at</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.500" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">which you can absorb these things not</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.330" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:28.860" style="s2">quickly they&#39;re dealt with maybe by</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:30.330" style="s2">macrophages or something and at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.860" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">point you&#39;ve overwhelmed the macrophages</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.330" end="00:04:34.259" style="s2">then you are in jeopardy and in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">outdoor environment the dissipation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.259" end="00:04:37.889" style="s2">these things and if it&#39;s daytime the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:39.330" style="s2">destruction of them in the sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.889" end="00:04:41.370" style="s2">makes it unlikely you will cross that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.330" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">threshold whereas indoors it can happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.370" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">in a five-minute conversation if</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:47.550" style="s2">somebody&#39;s sick and expelling virus</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">towards you and I think I think most of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.550" end="00:04:52.050" style="s2">our intuitions if we&#39;ve spent any time</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:53.729" style="s2">in the physical world are pretty good on</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.050" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">this front I&#39;m remembering as you talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.729" end="00:04:58.849" style="s2">about I was in San Antonio in November</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:01.620" style="s2">of last year and I found myself having</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.849" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">dinner one night an outdoor restaurant</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.620" end="00:05:05.729" style="s2">but it was in a little alley between two</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:07.770" style="s2">buildings and I had been very eager to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.729" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">sit outside because I always am unless</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.770" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">conditions are stifling in some regard</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:14.940" style="s2">but because it was really narrow between</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.949" style="s2">two rather tall buildings</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.940" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">I had the sense that the air wasn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.949" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">fresh as I wanted it to be and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">given what we know about these</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:25.949" style="s2">transmissions inside you know interior</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">restaurants of the coronavirus where</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.949" end="00:05:29.909" style="s2">people sitting it&#39;s sort of in line of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">the HVAC flow end up getting infected at</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.909" end="00:05:33.419" style="s2">much higher rates and those people</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">outside of that of course if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.419" end="00:05:38.340" style="s2">some kind of an urban jungle outside</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:40.289" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t going to be as protective</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.340" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">as if you&#39;re in an outside space with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.289" end="00:05:44.370" style="s2">lot of airflow as well so I&#39;ve got a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:46.590" style="s2">of these parameters to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.370" end="00:05:48.509" style="s2">absolutely and we have indicators from</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.590" end="00:05:50.520" style="s2">history that people have intuited</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.509" end="00:05:53.490" style="s2">certain things sometimes incorrectly so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:57.599" style="s2">I believe that both plague and malaria</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.490" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">have been attributed to stale air in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.599" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">historical past before the proper term</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">theory of disease told us what was going</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:07.020" style="s2">on in the case of malaria malaria is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:08.940" style="s2">exactly what it means it&#39;s not really a</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.940" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">of mosquitoes which inhabit swampy kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.190" end="00:06:17.039" style="s2">of air and in the case of so they just</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.620" end="00:06:19.409" style="s2">got it the at a gross level and an</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">imprecise level the observation is kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.409" end="00:06:23.909" style="s2">of accurate right like if you&#39;re hanging</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">out in an area with stagnant water that</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.990" end="00:06:34.469" style="s2">the things that vector malaria right</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.789" end="00:06:36.710" style="s2">it&#39;s inaccurate but there is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.469" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">observation that&#39;s real at the base</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.710" end="00:06:42.419" style="s2">it&#39;s also true that in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:44.129" style="s2">plague which at least in the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.419" end="00:06:46.409" style="s2">majority of cases is transmitted by</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.129" end="00:06:48.150" style="s2">fleas mm-hmm you&#39;re also talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.409" end="00:06:49.979" style="s2">place if you were in some dank place</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.150" end="00:06:51.689" style="s2">where you know there were rats</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.979" end="00:06:53.939" style="s2">I mean rats in particular have a smell</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.689" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">that you can detect walking into a room</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.939" end="00:06:56.699" style="s2">so there is some sort of indicator in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.770" style="s2">the air and it&#39;s not that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.699" end="00:07:00.569" style="s2">smelling fleas but nonetheless it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.770" end="00:07:03.020" style="s2">enough the sense that that&#39;s maybe not a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.569" end="00:07:05.099" style="s2">smell that you want to hang around is</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.020" end="00:07:06.750" style="s2">and at some level both of them are</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.099" end="00:07:08.819" style="s2">indicators of kind of you know trust</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.750" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">your nose trust your senses yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.819" end="00:07:14.310" style="s2">something is telling you back off just</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:17.849" style="s2">like if you run into decaying you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.310" end="00:07:20.009" style="s2">roadkill or pile of feces your</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.849" end="00:07:21.930" style="s2">everything in you says don&#39;t get closer</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.009" end="00:07:23.550" style="s2">to that yeah those intuitions are built</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.930" end="00:07:27.779" style="s2">around that which of course also fits</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.550" end="00:07:30.210" style="s2">with our sense of beauty perhaps being</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.779" end="00:07:32.250" style="s2">an indicator of lots of proxies for</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.210" end="00:07:36.509" style="s2">things that are useful or valuable or</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.250" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">tend to imply opportunity or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.509" end="00:07:40.259" style="s2">anyway what a shock that we are well</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:42.270" style="s2">designed for environments in which our</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.259" end="00:07:44.339" style="s2">senses can detect things that clue us in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.270" end="00:07:46.710" style="s2">to hazards we may not be able to name or</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.339" end="00:07:49.710" style="s2">describe and that many of us feel more</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.710" end="00:07:52.759" style="s2">afield than maybe we even recognize our</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.710" end="00:07:55.889" style="s2">ancestors would have because</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.759" end="00:07:57.569" style="s2">so many of us are not even living now in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.889" end="00:08:00.029" style="s2">the environments in which we grew up not</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.569" end="00:08:03.990" style="s2">only are aphorisms our cultural norms</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.029" end="00:08:05.669" style="s2">built around places that most of us may</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.990" end="00:08:07.110" style="s2">not live at the moment but our</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.669" end="00:08:09.569" style="s2">developmental environment is not a match</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.110" end="00:08:12.569" style="s2">for our current environment and so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.569" end="00:08:14.159" style="s2">are we are we are simply out of touch</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.569" end="00:08:15.839" style="s2">with our own selves in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.159" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">yeah we are out of our depth in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.839" end="00:08:20.759" style="s2">environment that we have largely created</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:22.379" style="s2">yeah so well wait before before we move</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.759" end="00:08:24.029" style="s2">on from the Solstice I want to say one</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.379" end="00:08:26.310" style="s2">other thing which is there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.029" end="00:08:28.139" style="s2">some facts about the Solstice and other</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.310" end="00:08:30.689" style="s2">celestial events that I think need to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.139" end="00:08:32.760" style="s2">said out loud because we just the lesson</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.689" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">is not it&#39;s not well taught in general</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.760" end="00:08:37.709" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna interrupt you and say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:38.909" style="s2">you I mean we but this was this is one</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.709" end="00:08:40.829" style="s2">of the things that you led when we used</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.909" end="00:08:44.219" style="s2">to teach together you created a workshop</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.829" end="00:08:46.050" style="s2">that grew every time with god I</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.219" end="00:08:49.560" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t prepared for this but</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.050" end="00:08:49.889" style="s2">you know three pages of questions like</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.560" end="00:08:51.720" style="s2">sing</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.889" end="00:08:54.139" style="s2">line questions like you know tens and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:56.730" style="s2">tens closing it on a hundred questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.139" end="00:08:58.649" style="s2">that you asked students to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.730" end="00:09:00.209" style="s2">you know what what they knew about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.649" end="00:09:01.290" style="s2">and whether or not they actually knew or</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.209" end="00:09:03.389" style="s2">if they were just accepting something</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.290" end="00:09:07.529" style="s2">they&#39;ve heard everything from you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.389" end="00:09:10.649" style="s2">what is the solstice to why our seasons</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.529" end="00:09:12.509" style="s2">and you know what our tides what our</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.649" end="00:09:14.100" style="s2">tides and why are there two high tides a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.509" end="00:09:16.350" style="s2">day that&#39;s the one that&#39;s the one that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.100" end="00:09:18.660" style="s2">was most stumping yes he most yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.350" end="00:09:23.160" style="s2">most stifling yeah so what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:24.389" style="s2">say was that a I hope the religious</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.160" end="00:09:25.919" style="s2">folks in our audience won&#39;t take this</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.389" end="00:09:29.369" style="s2">the wrong way but there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.919" end="00:09:31.470" style="s2">facts about the universe that really</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.369" end="00:09:34.199" style="s2">strongly suggest that one of two things</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.470" end="00:09:36.929" style="s2">has to be true either the universe was</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.199" end="00:09:40.079" style="s2">not designed by an engineering entity</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.929" end="00:09:42.119" style="s2">that wanted all this to happen or it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.079" end="00:09:45.449" style="s2">and that entity didn&#39;t like us or want</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.119" end="00:09:47.819" style="s2">us to succeed so one of them is that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.449" end="00:09:50.850" style="s2">number of days in a year is not an</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.819" end="00:09:52.709" style="s2">integer but it&#39;s close yeah and because</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.850" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">it&#39;s close what that means is that for</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.709" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">cultures that try to figure out how long</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:58.679" style="s2">the calendar is they can&#39;t nail it</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:01.319" style="s2">because they tend to be one day long or</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.679" end="00:10:03.209" style="s2">one day short at least and when you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.319" end="00:10:04.169" style="s2">that you tend to think for some number</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.209" end="00:10:05.999" style="s2">of years that you&#39;ve got it right</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.169" end="00:10:09.329" style="s2">because the vagary is the noise of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.999" end="00:10:11.369" style="s2">weather obscures the signal that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.329" end="00:10:13.439" style="s2">would detect as a slight shift every</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.369" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">year of you know if you put the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.439" end="00:10:19.019" style="s2">data plant is this day it won&#39;t be way</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:20.309" style="s2">off for twenty years maybe right and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.019" end="00:10:21.959" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to detect it because of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.309" end="00:10:24.419" style="s2">the you know the variation in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.959" end="00:10:26.600" style="s2">seasons weather weather is noise to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.419" end="00:10:29.669" style="s2">climate underlying it right and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.600" end="00:10:32.610" style="s2">anyway cultures around the world have</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.669" end="00:10:34.049" style="s2">there been to two things done one is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.610" end="00:10:35.579" style="s2">try to calculate it better and better</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.049" end="00:10:36.899" style="s2">and eventually you discover that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.579" end="00:10:38.699" style="s2">not an integer and you figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.899" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">to do about that and you insert</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.699" end="00:10:42.809" style="s2">something like leap year in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.110" end="00:10:45.480" style="s2">correct for the slight shift right which</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.809" end="00:10:47.249" style="s2">is incidentally why this year right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.480" end="00:10:49.350" style="s2">the Solstice is on the 28th rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.249" end="00:10:51.179" style="s2">the usual 21st this year is a leap year</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.350" end="00:10:53.339" style="s2">and so we had the 29th that got in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.179" end="00:10:55.679" style="s2">way and we&#39;re ahead other than that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.339" end="00:10:57.569" style="s2">we would be on the 21st as it usually is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.679" end="00:10:58.529" style="s2">although really the Solstice is a moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.569" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">in time not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.529" end="00:11:04.769" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s a mmm 5:30 p.m. something</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:09.420" style="s2">today anyway and so we celebrate short</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.769" end="00:11:11.610" style="s2">years three years and four yeah um okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.420" end="00:11:13.139" style="s2">so in any case cultures have figured out</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.610" end="00:11:15.329" style="s2">another way to deal with this which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.139" end="00:11:17.730" style="s2">not to go after the precision which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.329" end="00:11:20.639" style="s2">so maddeningly difficult to nail but</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.730" end="00:11:22.680" style="s2">it&#39;s to actually go empirical and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.639" end="00:11:26.370" style="s2">you&#39;ll find all of these clocks built</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.680" end="00:11:28.889" style="s2">into yeah into you know mountainsides</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.370" end="00:11:31.019" style="s2">and structures circular structures in</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.889" end="00:11:34.290" style="s2">which you know on the Solstice the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.019" end="00:11:36.420" style="s2">comes through this window and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.290" end="00:11:37.829" style="s2">lights up that corner actually I should</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.420" end="00:11:40.290" style="s2">have brought a picture of the Qunari</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.829" end="00:11:41.999" style="s2">version of this but I am but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.290" end="00:11:44.129" style="s2">there&#39;s there all of these calendars</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.999" end="00:11:45.899" style="s2">that are physical calendars that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.129" end="00:11:47.610" style="s2">need to be calibrated because they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.899" end="00:11:49.230" style="s2">physical and the lining up of several</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.610" end="00:11:50.879" style="s2">things allows you to actually know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.230" end="00:11:53.459" style="s2">day of the year it is so long as you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.879" end="00:11:55.439" style="s2">don&#39;t have cloud cover right well but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.459" end="00:11:57.029" style="s2">mean you can still as it approaches yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.439" end="00:12:02.459" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re sort of tracking it</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.029" end="00:12:04.410" style="s2">but so there it is the basic point is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.459" end="00:12:06.059" style="s2">the calendar has been frustratingly</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.410" end="00:12:08.069" style="s2">difficult to nail down it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.059" end="00:12:10.019" style="s2">very late emerging that we have a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.069" end="00:12:11.970" style="s2">answer to how long the year is that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.019" end="00:12:13.500" style="s2">can actually hang our hat on and many</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.970" end="00:12:14.970" style="s2">cultures have worked around that by</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.500" end="00:12:16.949" style="s2">going empirical and it&#39;s left all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.970" end="00:12:19.379" style="s2">this beautiful architectural evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.949" end="00:12:20.910" style="s2">yeah all over the world and you know a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.379" end="00:12:22.379" style="s2">lot of it is convergent this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.910" end="00:12:23.850" style="s2">necessarily cultures getting it from</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.379" end="00:12:26.009" style="s2">each other they&#39;re discovering the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.850" end="00:12:26.879" style="s2">problem and solving it in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.009" end="00:12:28.559" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.879" end="00:12:30.930" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly multiple evolutions of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.559" end="00:12:33.000" style="s2">it we know them at Inga perco which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.930" end="00:12:36.360" style="s2">this qunari inca sort of collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.000" end="00:12:37.829" style="s2">in ecuador is obviously independent from</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.360" end="00:12:39.449" style="s2">stonehenge right and there are many</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.829" end="00:12:43.050" style="s2">other examples that are independently</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.449" end="00:12:44.759" style="s2">evolved arrivals at the same way at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.050" end="00:12:47.850" style="s2">same problem the same Universal human</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.759" end="00:12:49.709" style="s2">problem of how is it that we figure out</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.850" end="00:12:51.389" style="s2">what this planet is that we&#39;re living on</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.709" end="00:12:53.480" style="s2">and when to plant really I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.389" end="00:12:56.129" style="s2">a I&#39;m sure that there are other reasons</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.480" end="00:12:57.870" style="s2">that early humans that you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.129" end="00:13:00.449" style="s2">prehistory humans just meaning before</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.870" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">humans were writing needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.449" end="00:13:03.749" style="s2">accurate about the time of year but</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">agriculture is a huge one yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.749" end="00:13:08.759" style="s2">and so we can expect that these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:11.009" style="s2">empirical ways of telling time over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.759" end="00:13:11.910" style="s2">course of a year probably started to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.009" end="00:13:13.740" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.910" end="00:13:15.149" style="s2">eight ten twelve thousand years ago in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.740" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">the various places where agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.149" end="00:13:18.779" style="s2">started to emerge at exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">times and again independently several</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.779" end="00:13:21.660" style="s2">evolutions several independent</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:23.579" style="s2">evolutions of agriculture across the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.660" end="00:13:24.180" style="s2">world about ten and twelve thousand</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.579" end="00:13:29.220" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.180" end="00:13:30.630" style="s2">and so actually final point this also it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.220" end="00:13:31.949" style="s2">actually tells us something about our</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.630" end="00:13:34.139" style="s2">current moment there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.949" end="00:13:36.839" style="s2">the internet and all of us interacting</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.139" end="00:13:38.759" style="s2">across arbitrary distances and time</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.839" end="00:13:40.740" style="s2">zones and all of that it&#39;s actually very</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.759" end="00:13:42.120" style="s2">disorienting on the one hand it alerts</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.740" end="00:13:43.230" style="s2">you to something true about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.120" end="00:13:44.850" style="s2">that you&#39;re on this planet full of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.230" end="00:13:46.709" style="s2">people for whom it is not the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.850" end="00:13:50.910" style="s2">of day and they may be in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.709" end="00:13:52.980" style="s2">season but it is disorienting in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.910" end="00:13:56.730" style="s2">sense that once upon a time and not so</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.980" end="00:13:59.459" style="s2">long ago what where you were seasonally</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.730" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">was not so much a question of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.459" end="00:14:02.759" style="s2">calendar that we all share was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">question of how the calendar interfaced</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.759" end="00:14:07.290" style="s2">with the particular ocean currents that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:08.819" style="s2">were near you or whatever and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:13.550" style="s2">always been troubled for example by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.819" end="00:14:16.500" style="s2">fact that we synonymous autumn with fall</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.550" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">my sense is fall is the period when the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.500" end="00:14:21.120" style="s2">leaves are falling right and that varies</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:22.649" style="s2">a lot it&#39;s not and it in LA for instance</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.120" end="00:14:24.540" style="s2">there is no fall really there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.649" end="00:14:26.550" style="s2">unless you have you know elemental</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.540" end="00:14:30.029" style="s2">there&#39;s no one fall because the trees</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.550" end="00:14:33.269" style="s2">come from all over the place in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.029" end="00:14:36.600" style="s2">pre-columbian LA there was no fall right</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.269" end="00:14:40.110" style="s2">yeah yeah so anyway it just the the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.600" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">of you know even the discovery of time</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.110" end="00:14:44.579" style="s2">zones is is an interesting fact and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:46.050" style="s2">until then and the question of what time</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.579" end="00:14:49.410" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.050" end="00:14:50.579" style="s2">it&#39;s a little odd because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.410" end="00:14:51.329" style="s2">don&#39;t have to ask because it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.579" end="00:14:53.130" style="s2">what time it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.329" end="00:14:55.259" style="s2">at least you know yeah during the day</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.130" end="00:14:58.170" style="s2">most days well I mean actually Zack</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.259" end="00:15:00.689" style="s2">our producer and older teenage son just</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.170" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">reminded me of something that he learned</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.689" end="00:15:05.699" style="s2">in history this year in which which I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:08.910" style="s2">knew as well which is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.699" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">actually the advent of trains across the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.910" end="00:15:13.949" style="s2">United States that forced cities and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:17.399" style="s2">states and presumably the federal</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.949" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">government to actually make uniform time</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.399" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">because otherwise there was no need for</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:22.680" style="s2">it but if a trains come in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:24.100" style="s2">moment and you need to pick someone up</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.680" end="00:15:25.480" style="s2">you need to catch a train</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.100" end="00:15:26.949" style="s2">you actually all need to agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:28.899" style="s2">time it is and what that means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.949" end="00:15:31.560" style="s2">no need for it because horses are just</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.899" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">not fast enough even at a horse crossing</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.560" end="00:15:36.040" style="s2">space you don&#39;t have a disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:37.630" style="s2">discontinuity whereas we now have well</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.040" end="00:15:39.790" style="s2">but I think boys huh more to the point</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.630" end="00:15:41.889" style="s2">you don&#39;t know for sure the horse is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.790" end="00:15:43.540" style="s2">gonna arrive at 4 p.m. you can say I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.889" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">expect to be there before dark you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.540" end="00:15:47.259" style="s2">send a letter and say I&#39;m hoping to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.970" style="s2">there before dark on the Saturday of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.259" end="00:15:50.889" style="s2">Harvest Moon or whatever it is but</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.970" end="00:15:52.060" style="s2">there&#39;s not there&#39;s not a horse</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.889" end="00:15:54.250" style="s2">scheduled the way there is a train</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.060" end="00:15:57.160" style="s2">schedule that&#39;s not really true you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.250" end="00:15:59.620" style="s2">in in the 16th century</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.160" end="00:16:03.100" style="s2">ok proto-fascist used to make the horses</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.620" end="00:16:04.899" style="s2">run on time which was famously oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.100" end="00:16:10.149" style="s2">yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.899" end="00:16:12.009" style="s2">ok Oh Zach says he thinks it was also</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.149" end="00:16:13.779" style="s2">about making the trains not crash so it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.009" end="00:16:16.329" style="s2">was an aesthetic isn&#39;t certain yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.779" end="00:16:20.199" style="s2">think so yeah these little trim niggling</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.329" end="00:16:22.660" style="s2">concerns ok so you went to LA yes I did</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.199" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">go to LA and actually I must tell you I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.660" end="00:16:26.139" style="s2">had not been on a plane exactly you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:28.149" style="s2">to talk about that a little bit cuz that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.139" end="00:16:29.829" style="s2">that is that was the first time either</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.149" end="00:16:31.300" style="s2">of us had travelled since February yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.829" end="00:16:34.750" style="s2">and I wouldn&#39;t have done it if it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.300" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">very important you know joe rogan is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.750" end="00:16:38.439" style="s2">a special phenomenon and so it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:40.630" style="s2">worth doing in light of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.439" end="00:16:44.500" style="s2">in the world and the opportunity to talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.630" end="00:16:48.040" style="s2">about it with Joe to his audience but</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.500" end="00:16:50.589" style="s2">the act of getting on an airplane was of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.040" end="00:16:52.540" style="s2">all the things that I&#39;ve seen I think it</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.589" end="00:16:55.060" style="s2">was the most different from normal</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.540" end="00:16:57.459" style="s2">right the experience from one end of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.060" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">to the other of the airport of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.459" end="00:17:02.620" style="s2">airplane everything was bizarre and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:05.169" style="s2">although in some ways you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.620" end="00:17:07.689" style="s2">airport was wonderfully empty at some</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.169" end="00:17:12.189" style="s2">level it was you know it was a calmer</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.689" end="00:17:13.809" style="s2">space and my plane Zach do you have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.189" end="00:17:18.059" style="s2">video can you put the video on that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.809" end="00:17:21.959" style="s2">took of my plane ok so we&#39;ll show you a</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.059" end="00:17:21.959" style="s2">video of what it looked like</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.500" end="00:17:32.120" style="s2">see very few seats are full leather</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.409" end="00:17:33.980" style="s2">flayed it would have been fun yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.120" end="00:17:36.340" style="s2">flight would have been jams hacked on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.980" end="00:17:36.340" style="s2">normal</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">so anyway it&#39;s a very different and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.320" end="00:17:43.670" style="s2">jarring experience in as much as lots of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.960" end="00:17:46.430" style="s2">aspects of it the more comfortable I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.670" end="00:17:49.070" style="s2">have to say sense that something must</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.430" end="00:17:51.170" style="s2">have gone very very wrong for a plane to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.070" end="00:17:54.470" style="s2">look like this during a normal flying</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.170" end="00:17:56.690" style="s2">period was it just never lifts you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.470" end="00:17:58.940" style="s2">constantly reminded that something is</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.690" end="00:18:00.920" style="s2">way off I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re enclosed in</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:02.840" style="s2">your face mask yeah one thing in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.920" end="00:18:04.760" style="s2">wore not only my band and I were a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.840" end="00:18:06.800" style="s2">double facemask thinking that this was</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.760" end="00:18:09.080" style="s2">about the most dangerous thing I had</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.800" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">engaged in since recirculated air yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">cannot escape from how they do say</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:15.230" style="s2">before you get on the plane there now</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:17.090" style="s2">like these uh screens that broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.230" end="00:18:19.130" style="s2">information tell you that the air is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.090" end="00:18:20.780" style="s2">HEPA filtered I couldn&#39;t get anybody to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.130" end="00:18:22.100" style="s2">tell me for sure whether that was normal</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.780" end="00:18:23.900" style="s2">and they&#39;re just telling us about it now</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.100" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">or it has been added nobody seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.900" end="00:18:27.559" style="s2">know but at the moment it&#39;s broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:31.580" style="s2">this information and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.559" end="00:18:33.530" style="s2">are are and that should I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.580" end="00:18:35.059" style="s2">should do it right this is a big virus</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.530" end="00:18:36.920" style="s2">that should HEPA filter filtration</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.059" end="00:18:40.010" style="s2">should do it well if it was the virus</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.920" end="00:18:42.260" style="s2">alone it wouldn&#39;t be enough but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.010" end="00:18:44.059" style="s2">of the virus travels in water droplets</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.260" end="00:18:45.380" style="s2">really the virus alone would not be</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.059" end="00:18:46.190" style="s2">caught by have the filter is that right</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.380" end="00:18:47.690" style="s2">I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.190" end="00:18:49.160" style="s2">very smell that there isn&#39;t there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.690" end="00:18:54.530" style="s2">number I forget what the scale is gold</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.160" end="00:18:57.559" style="s2">but so anyway I also in both directions</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.530" end="00:18:59.240" style="s2">my flight was either canceled or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.559" end="00:19:01.300" style="s2">plane was changed there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.240" end="00:19:04.070" style="s2">just not functioning very well in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.300" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">system so there is that but yes I went</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.070" end="00:19:13.550" style="s2">to LA and LA is also very off it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:15.170" style="s2">coming out of lockdown so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.550" end="00:19:18.440" style="s2">beginning to be traffic again and things</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.170" end="00:19:21.500" style="s2">like that but it&#39;s rather surreal out</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.440" end="00:19:23.660" style="s2">there I&#39;ll bet so and if you want I</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.500" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">guess I&#39;m curious and maybe most people</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.660" end="00:19:27.460" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be if they don&#39;t know la well</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:30.650" style="s2">but the idea of an LA without traffic</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.460" end="00:19:33.190" style="s2">strikes me is not really la you know in</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.650" end="00:19:35.540" style="s2">a much a much improved environment but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.190" end="00:19:37.490" style="s2">think you know earlier in the lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.540" end="00:19:39.110" style="s2">we were hearing that the streets were</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.490" end="00:19:42.020" style="s2">empty and kids are playing ball in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.110" end="00:19:43.010" style="s2">streets and and such and is there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.020" end="00:19:46.040" style="s2">there anything else you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.010" end="00:19:48.500" style="s2">about you know the experience of moving</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.040" end="00:19:52.280" style="s2">through LA</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.500" end="00:19:54.169" style="s2">as it emerges from lockdown you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.280" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">thing is there&#39;s not very much reason to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.169" end="00:19:59.179" style="s2">move through it so so you just went to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:01.210" style="s2">where you go it&#39;s sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.179" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">wherever you are you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.210" end="00:20:06.260" style="s2">experiencing and what you face I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:08.870" style="s2">was there with you but South Korea right</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.260" end="00:20:13.490" style="s2">are they completely free I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.870" end="00:20:15.169" style="s2">actually I&#39;m not sure but yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.490" end="00:20:19.010" style="s2">somewhere on pause some kind of pause</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.169" end="00:20:21.620" style="s2">and that experience varies a bit but the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.010" end="00:20:23.900" style="s2">weird sense of you know things happen in</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.620" end="00:20:25.610" style="s2">one place and it can disrupt the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.900" end="00:20:27.380" style="s2">functioning of a city but for the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.610" end="00:20:28.190" style="s2">to be this way at once is very strange</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:31.580" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.190" end="00:20:34.190" style="s2">so you were invited by Joe Rogan to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.580" end="00:20:38.450" style="s2">to go back on your fourth fifth this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.190" end="00:20:42.110" style="s2">time third time alone I believe and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.450" end="00:20:43.730" style="s2">early in your talk with him you said</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.110" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">that you had been struck by police twice</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.730" end="00:20:49.340" style="s2">in your life and the story that you told</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.750" style="s2">on air actually is when I had I had not</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.340" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">heard and we must have been living</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.750" end="00:20:53.419" style="s2">together at the time because the only</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:56.299" style="s2">time you lived in Berkeley was when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.419" end="00:20:59.240" style="s2">lived in Berkeley together you said that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.299" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">you joined protests against homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.240" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">in Berkeley because you supported the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:04.940" style="s2">cause but you hadn&#39;t even known it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:07.960" style="s2">happening like just wiped through it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.940" end="00:21:10.280" style="s2">I just bikes down there yeah exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.960" end="00:21:13.429" style="s2">having joined it you were promptly</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.280" end="00:21:15.710" style="s2">smacked by a cop with a baton yeah cop</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.429" end="00:21:19.429" style="s2">knocked me down with a baton amazing me</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.710" end="00:21:23.990" style="s2">tell you know you think I was do I to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.429" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">remember couldn&#39;t say no I&#39;m I think I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.990" end="00:21:25.820" style="s2">would remember that I think you would</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.820" end="00:21:31.850" style="s2">yeah so you had your bike with you no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:33.650" style="s2">I was on foot yeah - I was moving the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.850" end="00:21:35.510" style="s2">crowd was moving towards the Berkeley</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.650" end="00:21:37.370" style="s2">campus and I was moving with them and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.510" end="00:21:39.169" style="s2">ran into this cabin I you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.370" end="00:21:42.169" style="s2">remember other people get smacked down I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.169" end="00:21:44.900" style="s2">just you know no only was personal</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.169" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">it was awful yeah but and it alerted me</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.900" end="00:21:48.049" style="s2">to this sort of sense which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:50.690" style="s2">it was the first place that I really</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.049" end="00:21:53.539" style="s2">understood okay all I had to do to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.690" end="00:21:55.220" style="s2">this cops enemy was to just be in favor</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.539" end="00:21:56.419" style="s2">of this cause and March this direction</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.220" end="00:21:59.240" style="s2">yeah this has nothing to do with my</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.419" end="00:22:01.190" style="s2">behavior right I was just I wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.240" end="00:22:02.260" style="s2">was a peaceful protest you were marching</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.190" end="00:22:04.450" style="s2">towards the campus you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.260" end="00:22:06.760" style="s2">was a loud peaceful protest okay but</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.450" end="00:22:09.730" style="s2">loud like angry loud or musical loud</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.760" end="00:22:11.710" style="s2">chanting loud not that it matters say it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.730" end="00:22:13.390" style="s2">was I mean you know it&#39;s a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.710" end="00:22:15.930" style="s2">that&#39;s it yeah my memory is dim but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.390" end="00:22:19.210" style="s2">would say it&#39;s it was loud and angry</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.930" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">okay but it was what it was nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.210" end="00:22:23.080" style="s2">I didn&#39;t you know I didn&#39;t threaten</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:25.180" style="s2">anybody I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.080" end="00:22:27.190" style="s2">breaking anything I was just going in</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.180" end="00:22:28.390" style="s2">that direction mmm-hmm and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.190" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">that was that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.390" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">so you said well there were two Joe said</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:36.430" style="s2">were they and you said well the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:39.220" style="s2">one is a long story from my first</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.430" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">research gig in Jamaica and you then</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.220" end="00:22:43.210" style="s2">skip to the next one and it didn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:44.950" style="s2">back up but I&#39;m thinking you might want</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.210" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">to tell that story because this one no</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.950" end="00:22:48.910" style="s2">this is the the revenge best served live</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:52.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t it you&#39;re gonna have me tell that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.910" end="00:22:55.270" style="s2">story here I think I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.750" end="00:22:57.550" style="s2">fascinating I think I at least watch</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.270" end="00:22:59.320" style="s2">that and thought oh like I know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.550" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">story and I still want to hear it all</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.320" end="00:23:05.470" style="s2">right well let me see if I can put the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:09.850" style="s2">story back together so I was I guess it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.470" end="00:23:11.500" style="s2">would have been 20 this is when this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.850" end="00:23:13.450" style="s2">when you were you spent seven weeks in</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.500" end="00:23:15.100" style="s2">Jamaica with Bob Trevor&#39;s yeah Bob</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.450" end="00:23:16.900" style="s2">Trivers is a great evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.100" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">biologist who&#39;s a good friend of ours</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.900" end="00:23:19.090" style="s2">actually he was the officiant at our</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.520" end="00:23:21.460" style="s2">wedding</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.090" end="00:23:25.390" style="s2">yeah um after long after this event but</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.460" end="00:23:28.330" style="s2">so this would have been 90 probably 1990</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.390" end="00:23:31.000" style="s2">fall of 1990 fall of 1990 so you would</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.330" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">have been 21 21 years 22 okay so I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.000" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">in Jamaica extended period of time I did</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:36.730" style="s2">not know in what manner I would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:40.390" style="s2">staying I was 91</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.730" end="00:23:42.670" style="s2">sorry probably 91 91 okay so I went with</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.390" end="00:23:46.210" style="s2">Bob to help him with research on lizards</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.670" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">that he was doing Bob is a guy of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.210" end="00:23:55.930" style="s2">European descent but he prefers to live</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.540" end="00:23:58.330" style="s2">with black people he identifies as black</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.930" end="00:24:01.090" style="s2">before that was ever a thing um so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.330" end="00:24:03.160" style="s2">anyway he lives in Jamaica and he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.090" end="00:24:05.380" style="s2">married to Jamaican woman he&#39;s divorced</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.160" end="00:24:07.210" style="s2">but he has kids with her and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.380" end="00:24:11.050" style="s2">still a member of their family and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.210" end="00:24:13.630" style="s2">anyway I went down to research with him</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.050" end="00:24:15.940" style="s2">and I arrived and he picked me up at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.630" end="00:24:16.150" style="s2">airport and I at that point discovered</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.940" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.150" end="00:24:18.700" style="s2">way I would be living in Jamaica he just</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.650" end="00:24:20.740" style="s2">said he would take care of it he hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.700" end="00:24:23.650" style="s2">told me a thing and it turned out that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.740" end="00:24:25.960" style="s2">was living with his family that one of</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.140" end="00:24:54.790" style="s2">because they were related through the</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.790" end="00:24:58.030" style="s2">part of the family even though he and</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:20.410" style="s2">Jamaica&#39;s warm climate this is by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.500" end="00:25:22.630" style="s2">way off in the country right this is in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.410" end="00:25:25.000" style="s2">Southfield Jamaica which the only place</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.630" end="00:25:26.470" style="s2">that you might know about if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.000" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">from Jamaica that you would have heard</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.470" end="00:25:30.820" style="s2">of that was anywhere near by his lover&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:33.010" style="s2">leap lovers leap is a famous Vista where</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.820" end="00:25:34.600" style="s2">I think two people were supposed to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.010" end="00:25:36.220" style="s2">committed suicide together lovers who</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.600" end="00:25:37.720" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be together and there may</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.220" end="00:25:39.190" style="s2">actually be an interaction with slavery</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.720" end="00:25:42.280" style="s2">in that story which I have now forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.190" end="00:25:43.900" style="s2">but but in any case lover&#39;s leap is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.280" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">famous place South field is near it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.900" end="00:25:47.920" style="s2">when I was in Southfield it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:49.960" style="s2">primitive enough that there was no phone</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.920" end="00:25:52.210" style="s2">I had I brought a bike with me so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.960" end="00:25:55.540" style="s2">could ride to the junction to call you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.210" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">since you and I were already involved</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.540" end="00:25:59.410" style="s2">and committed to each other and so I had</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:00.430" style="s2">to have a bicycle to get to the junction</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.410" end="00:26:02.130" style="s2">because there was gonna be no other way</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.430" end="00:26:04.510" style="s2">to make contact with you regularly so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.130" end="00:26:07.300" style="s2">anyway and that was ten or fifteen miles</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.510" end="00:26:08.770" style="s2">away I don&#39;t know what the state of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.300" end="00:26:12.250" style="s2">Technology is there I would imagine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.770" end="00:26:15.309" style="s2">changed a lot but in any probable as we</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.250" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">saw a first-hand in Madagascar that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.309" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">cellphones moved in and then landlines</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:19.210" style="s2">never happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:20.890" style="s2">so probably people have cell phones that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.210" end="00:26:22.510" style="s2">could well be could well me what</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.890" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">happening here it&#39;s a good prediction</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.510" end="00:26:26.950" style="s2">but anyway so I was staying in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.400" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">house and the house is a house but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.950" end="00:26:31.720" style="s2">kitchen is outside there&#39;s technically</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:34.059" style="s2">running water which involves pumping</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.720" end="00:26:34.539" style="s2">water that&#39;s collected from rain off the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.059" end="00:26:38.710" style="s2">roofs</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.539" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">out of a big pool under a so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.710" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">big pool collects water off the rooms</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:45.400" style="s2">and then you pump it into an air tank</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">above the house and then that feeds the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.400" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">running water but for some reason that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">wasn&#39;t up and running but there you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.330" style="s2">there were outhouses and you took a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:54.580" style="s2">shower by dropping a bucket into these</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.330" end="00:26:56.110" style="s2">big pools and you tried not to knock the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.580" end="00:26:58.990" style="s2">bottom out of the bucket when you did it</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.110" end="00:27:00.100" style="s2">which was difficult but anyway you would</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.990" end="00:27:02.169" style="s2">do that and you&#39;d pour water over your</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.100" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">head to shower and so anyway it was that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.169" end="00:27:07.330" style="s2">kind of thing but the yard was basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:12.580" style="s2">the center of a community right this was</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.330" end="00:27:14.049" style="s2">a this was a it was a clan a group of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.580" end="00:27:18.549" style="s2">people who were affiliated in one way or</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.049" end="00:27:22.659" style="s2">another not just the family itself and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.549" end="00:27:25.260" style="s2">became good friends with Lexi and Prince</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.659" end="00:27:31.000" style="s2">who were somewhere near my age and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.260" end="00:27:33.070" style="s2">anyway it was very interesting to be you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.000" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">know to be friends with people who were</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.070" end="00:27:37.000" style="s2">living such different lives but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:39.159" style="s2">we got along really well and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.000" end="00:27:40.330" style="s2">tremendous amount of fun so here&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.159" end="00:27:44.169" style="s2">get to the difficult part of the story</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.330" end="00:27:47.830" style="s2">this time in my life I smoked pot pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.169" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">regularly and I was in Jamaica and pot</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.830" end="00:27:52.659" style="s2">is very unstick Mathai z&#39;d in Jamaica</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:54.220" style="s2">and I wanted to have some and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.659" end="00:28:01.390" style="s2">want to be sourcing it a little bit at a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.220" end="00:28:04.059" style="s2">time so I and it was also that what this</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.390" end="00:28:06.010" style="s2">image of that being pulled I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.059" end="00:28:09.730" style="s2">have some and I didn&#39;t want to source it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.010" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">a little bit well don&#39;t forget this was</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.730" end="00:28:15.730" style="s2">your idea for me to tell the story so</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:17.260" style="s2">anyway so pot was cheap there it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.730" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">especially good it&#39;s what we wish called</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.260" end="00:28:23.770" style="s2">ditch weed yeah right but it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:25.179" style="s2">plentiful and so anyway I so you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.770" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">either buy it a little bit at a time or</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.179" end="00:28:28.179" style="s2">you could buy way more than I was going</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:30.039" style="s2">to need so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.179" end="00:28:32.169" style="s2">I think I threw 100 bucks of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.039" end="00:28:34.360" style="s2">or something and I ended up with 10</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.169" end="00:28:39.070" style="s2">times what I would have needed and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.360" end="00:28:43.350" style="s2">I had a maybe an ounce of it and I had</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.070" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">given the rest to my friend Lexi and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.350" end="00:28:48.190" style="s2">anyway I was there and things were good</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:51.700" style="s2">and I was researching with Bob and I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.190" end="00:28:53.950" style="s2">learning a ton about how other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.700" end="00:28:56.350" style="s2">exist in the world and all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.950" end="00:29:00.009" style="s2">anything about lizards and about lizards</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.350" end="00:29:02.769" style="s2">and as my time and to make it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.009" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">drawing to a close one night I had gone</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.769" end="00:29:09.429" style="s2">to bed just like I would any other night</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:14.289" style="s2">and really late like 2:00 in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.429" end="00:29:18.490" style="s2">would be my recollection I hear a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.289" end="00:29:21.249" style="s2">loud thud and I wake up and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.490" end="00:29:24.039" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that is and suddenly I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.249" end="00:29:26.249" style="s2">hear a lot of shouting and there are men</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.039" end="00:29:29.409" style="s2">streaming into the house and these</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.249" end="00:29:33.999" style="s2">officers obviously police officers</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.409" end="00:29:36.519" style="s2">dressed fully in riot gear military gear</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.999" end="00:29:38.919" style="s2">they were heavily armed multiple</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.519" end="00:29:41.649" style="s2">automatic weapons are coming through</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.919" end="00:29:42.820" style="s2">shouting about something I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.649" end="00:29:45.460" style="s2">what the hell&#39;s going on I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.820" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">sitting there stunned right I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.460" end="00:29:50.110" style="s2">mean frankly I probably hadn&#39;t seen a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:51.879" style="s2">cop in Southfield it just was you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.110" end="00:29:53.230" style="s2">it was a little outpost somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.879" end="00:29:57.249" style="s2">suddenly these cops from who knows where</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.230" end="00:29:59.950" style="s2">and anyway one of them comes into my</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.249" end="00:30:02.200" style="s2">room and he I cannot do it Jamaican</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.950" end="00:30:04.299" style="s2">accents very difficult acting he says</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.200" end="00:30:07.149" style="s2">you know there&#39;s one white brother in</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.299" end="00:30:08.769" style="s2">here and then there&#39;s like a commotion</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.149" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">what does this mean anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.769" end="00:30:12.970" style="s2">it so anyway I&#39;m sitting there and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:14.590" style="s2">standing in the doorway and it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.970" end="00:30:16.869" style="s2">that I&#39;m supposed to stay still and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.590" end="00:30:19.269" style="s2">stay perfectly still and they go</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.869" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">streaming into the other rooms and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.269" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">afraid because although pot is not a</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:30.789" style="s2">it&#39;s still illegal right and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.970" end="00:30:33.309" style="s2">there&#39;s probably half an ounce of pot</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.789" end="00:30:38.019" style="s2">under my bed all right yeah you know in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.309" end="00:30:40.779" style="s2">a little paper bag and anyway they kind</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.980" end="00:33:42.360" style="s2">meters apart they&#39;re not right close to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.779" end="00:33:45.000" style="s2">each other yeah and anyway we walk off</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.360" end="00:33:47.070" style="s2">across the night and my recollection is</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.000" end="00:33:50.370" style="s2">we get to the door of the house where</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.070" end="00:33:54.899" style="s2">Princess House sitting and I am like mid</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.370" end="00:33:57.179" style="s2">knock and hands grab me away from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.899" end="00:33:59.909" style="s2">door and suddenly I find myself up</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.179" end="00:34:01.950" style="s2">against the wall facing these cops they</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.909" end="00:34:03.929" style="s2">were going to how did you like how did</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.950" end="00:34:06.360" style="s2">you not know they were there well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.929" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">the thing were they were they&#39;ve quiet</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:13.500" style="s2">us coming and maybe they&#39;d left the cars</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.149" end="00:34:15.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what they had done</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.500" end="00:34:18.210" style="s2">but for some reason we were there</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.240" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">stealthily I&#39;m surprised yeah so they</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.210" end="00:34:23.879" style="s2">grabbed Johnny and me and ninety-two yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:27.569" style="s2">oh yeah and they have us up against the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.879" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2">wall and I realize oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.569" end="00:34:35.010" style="s2">I had just thrown on clothing from you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:38.819" style="s2">know the day before and in my pocket</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.010" end="00:34:41.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a joint and a lighter and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.819" end="00:34:45.569" style="s2">cop is searching me mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.220" end="00:34:48.980" style="s2">and he reaches into my pocket and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.569" end="00:34:51.750" style="s2">steals my lighter and misses the joint</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.980" end="00:34:53.819" style="s2">all right like letters maybe a rare</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.750" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">commodity in Southfield they are a</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.819" end="00:34:58.319" style="s2">fairly rare case you know it&#39;s an object</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:35:02.039" style="s2">of value so anyway I breathe another</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.319" end="00:35:02.940" style="s2">sigh of relief and the cop is being</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.039" end="00:35:04.529" style="s2">rough with me</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.940" end="00:35:05.849" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s roughing me up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.529" end="00:35:10.619" style="s2">rough with Johnny too as far as you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.849" end="00:35:14.220" style="s2">yeah both of us and I am NOT happy to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.619" end="00:35:16.049" style="s2">roughed up I and so I&#39;m trying to reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.220" end="00:35:17.579" style="s2">with him I later have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.049" end="00:35:19.289" style="s2">with Bob about what I should have done</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.579" end="00:35:21.059" style="s2">but nonetheless I&#39;m trying to reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.289" end="00:35:22.619" style="s2">with them I&#39;m trying to be decent and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.059" end="00:35:24.420" style="s2">all of the things that you would do to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.619" end="00:35:26.369" style="s2">get a cop to stop doing this to you and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.420" end="00:35:29.309" style="s2">it&#39;s not working and at some point I</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.369" end="00:35:34.890" style="s2">curse in Jamaican and ice so I say Ross</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.309" end="00:35:36.869" style="s2">clot right and the cop knocks me to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.890" end="00:35:38.549" style="s2">ground right kaboom</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.869" end="00:35:41.190" style="s2">alright who&#39;s his arms or does he have</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.549" end="00:35:45.930" style="s2">it he grabs me and throws me to my gun</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.190" end="00:35:49.109" style="s2">and and I&#39;m stunned this is not a normal</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.930" end="00:35:51.059" style="s2">occurrence in any way I kind of get back</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.109" end="00:35:53.849" style="s2">up and he tells me to stay there quietly</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.059" end="00:35:55.230" style="s2">and they go in and they searched the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.849" end="00:35:57.839" style="s2">house and I don&#39;t think they find</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.230" end="00:35:58.829" style="s2">anything in this house and they don&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.839" end="00:36:00.420" style="s2">they don&#39;t take prints away</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.829" end="00:36:02.250" style="s2">they don&#39;t take prints away and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.420" end="00:36:05.069" style="s2">they disappear into the night and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.250" end="00:36:08.490" style="s2">they&#39;re gone so you think stealth was</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.069" end="00:36:10.559" style="s2">right go back to the house and we confer</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.490" end="00:36:10.950" style="s2">and and then you talk to Prince - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.559" end="00:36:13.260" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.950" end="00:36:14.460" style="s2">absolutely I think at this point and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.260" end="00:36:15.960" style="s2">this is the moment for me to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.460" end="00:36:17.970" style="s2">what Bob told you you should have done</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.960" end="00:36:19.109" style="s2">or do you want to oh yeah so what does</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.970" end="00:36:20.700" style="s2">Bob say later you should have done</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.109" end="00:36:24.420" style="s2">before you continue oh I said I should</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.700" end="00:36:28.349" style="s2">have gone into a upstanding American</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.420" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">citizen proper English mode that I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.349" end="00:36:37.220" style="s2">have basically not tried to be of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:41.069" style="s2">population I should have emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.220" end="00:36:43.380" style="s2">being outside of it that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.069" end="00:36:46.319" style="s2">telling yes it is tell us basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.380" end="00:36:49.380" style="s2">basically he&#39;s saying you know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.319" end="00:36:52.680" style="s2">man who was lived with an among and as</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.380" end="00:36:55.890" style="s2">family in Jamaica most of his adult life</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.680" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">who&#39;s basically saying as you have you</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.890" end="00:36:58.410" style="s2">use your privilege honorably use it when</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:01.980" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.410" end="00:37:04.440" style="s2">so that you can help those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.980" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">have it just as long as we&#39;re here and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.440" end="00:37:10.200" style="s2">since these things are on Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">anyway Bob Traverse was a black panther</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.200" end="00:37:14.789" style="s2">there&#39;s some story that I think I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:16.349" style="s2">know about why he was I think he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.789" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">kicked out of the Black Panthers for his</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.349" end="00:37:21.510" style="s2">own good but but I think he was still in</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:24.809" style="s2">the Black Panthers at the point that he</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.510" end="00:37:27.900" style="s2">actually had as a graduate student and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.809" end="00:37:31.109" style="s2">graduated with a PhD Huey P Newton Huey</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.900" end="00:37:33.030" style="s2">Newton was he had a PhD in biology I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.109" end="00:37:35.160" style="s2">gonna tutelage ABAB driven evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.030" end="00:37:38.369" style="s2">biology yeah yes I think that was after</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.160" end="00:37:41.670" style="s2">the Panther fee and Huey remained close</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.369" end="00:37:43.890" style="s2">okay and so anyway he remained close</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.670" end="00:37:45.630" style="s2">with the Newton family is as we saw when</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.890" end="00:37:47.069" style="s2">we were friends when we were living in</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.630" end="00:37:49.890" style="s2">the same place with him in the early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.069" end="00:37:51.240" style="s2">long after well at least somewhat after</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.890" end="00:37:55.789" style="s2">Newton had been killed</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.240" end="00:37:58.740" style="s2">yeah so his admonition was not it was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.789" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">practical piece of advice it was not out</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.740" end="00:38:02.819" style="s2">of love for the police because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:05.069" style="s2">the tension between the Black Panthers</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.819" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">and the police was intense and at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.069" end="00:38:08.940" style="s2">point you know the point he&#39;s giving me</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:13.589" style="s2">this advice he knew it was already dead</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.940" end="00:38:16.319" style="s2">for years so ok you and Johnny go back</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.589" end="00:38:17.579" style="s2">to the house we gather ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.319" end="00:38:18.779" style="s2">eventually we go back to bed because</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.579" end="00:38:21.240" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to do all right</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.779" end="00:38:22.349" style="s2">it&#39;s happened and we will find out the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.240" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">night thing it&#39;s notjust not even</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.349" end="00:38:27.029" style="s2">anywhere way to call anybody no no no</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.829" style="s2">where to go right right so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.029" end="00:38:29.970" style="s2">over yeah and so anyway and go back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.829" end="00:38:32.099" style="s2">bed and the next day we get up and we</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.260" end="00:38:44.220" style="s2">actually had gone</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.599" end="00:38:49.289" style="s2">sorry Bob but no Bob Bob had gone to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.220" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">give a talk I really hope it&#39;s ok to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.289" end="00:38:52.319" style="s2">this I think it&#39;s public record I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:54.539" style="s2">Bob has talked about it if he went to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.319" end="00:38:56.490" style="s2">the CIA the CIA was interested in his</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.539" end="00:38:58.260" style="s2">work on deceit and self-deception and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.490" end="00:38:59.849" style="s2">did not feel you know I don&#39;t think even</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.260" end="00:39:01.770" style="s2">he loved the CIA but it was something I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.849" end="00:39:03.059" style="s2">felt like he was giving up any important</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.770" end="00:39:04.410" style="s2">secrets in fact I mean he&#39;s published</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.059" end="00:39:06.940" style="s2">his work on deceit himself design and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.410" end="00:39:09.640" style="s2">it&#39;s out there so</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.940" end="00:39:11.859" style="s2">he before he left he he was very proud</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.640" end="00:39:14.170" style="s2">of this joke that he would by lecturing</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.859" end="00:39:20.440" style="s2">on deceit and self-deception to the CIA</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.170" end="00:39:22.630" style="s2">he was taking coals to Newcastle the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.440" end="00:39:24.460" style="s2">idea that the cops stole your your</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.630" end="00:39:27.099" style="s2">lighter from you reminded me of one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.460" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">Bob&#39;s examples of self-deception in his</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.099" end="00:39:30.789" style="s2">in his work on the subject in which he</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:34.180" style="s2">reports that he is constantly stealing</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.789" end="00:39:38.799" style="s2">lighters from himself himself bereft of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.180" end="00:39:40.180" style="s2">lighters right okay so let me try to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.799" end="00:39:42.039" style="s2">recall the order of events I think the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.180" end="00:39:43.960" style="s2">next thing that happens is its gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.039" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">the next morning you guys yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.960" end="00:39:49.809" style="s2">so I&#39;m now closing in on my leave date</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:52.119" style="s2">for Jamaica I have my ticket out and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.809" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">we&#39;re in the last couple days and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.119" end="00:39:57.849" style="s2">think the next thing that happens is I</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:59.859" style="s2">go I make a point of going to the jail</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.849" end="00:40:00.970" style="s2">where Lexi has been taken to see him</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.859" end="00:40:02.740" style="s2">because I&#39;m not gonna see him otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.970" end="00:40:04.210" style="s2">and he and I become friends and I just</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.740" end="00:40:06.930" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to leave the island not</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.210" end="00:40:09.609" style="s2">saying goodbye to him and so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.930" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">whatever the jail was it was in one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.609" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">the town&#39;s not too far away you know 30</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:19.089" style="s2">40 miles away maybe and somehow I maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:26.170" style="s2">I got uncle Vernie to drive me in Bob&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.089" end="00:40:28.029" style="s2">car as long as we&#39;re doing this let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.170" end="00:40:30.190" style="s2">take this little detour so among the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.029" end="00:40:32.589" style="s2">many shocking lessons of my time in</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.190" end="00:40:34.119" style="s2">Jamaica was that there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.589" end="00:40:37.059" style="s2">inferiority complex</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.119" end="00:40:40.089" style="s2">among Jamaicans about the capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.059" end="00:40:43.180" style="s2">people that they saw coming from the US</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.089" end="00:40:45.420" style="s2">and other mainland countries had right</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.180" end="00:40:48.730" style="s2">there was a sense of inferiority but</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.420" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">from my perspective I was around people</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.730" end="00:40:53.710" style="s2">who had tremendous ingenuity to be able</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:55.750" style="s2">to do things when they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.710" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">necessarily have the right part right</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.750" end="00:40:59.950" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t just source stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:03.069" style="s2">they were tremendously ingenious at</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.950" end="00:41:04.390" style="s2">solving problems that in the States you</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.069" end="00:41:05.799" style="s2">know you would bring your car somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.390" end="00:41:08.260" style="s2">and they would just replace a part in</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.799" end="00:41:09.819" style="s2">Jamaica they might have to fashion a</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.260" end="00:41:11.559" style="s2">part or if they couldn&#39;t fashion a part</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.819" end="00:41:13.000" style="s2">they&#39;d have to clued some solution to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.559" end="00:41:15.339" style="s2">make the car run anyway and they were</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.000" end="00:41:17.619" style="s2">constantly doing this and so anyway look</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.339" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">the opposite to me but there was</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.619" end="00:41:22.340" style="s2">something about the razzle-dazzle nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:24.140" style="s2">the you know the gadgets and techniques</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.340" end="00:41:25.730" style="s2">and the ease with which things work when</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.140" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">you have exactly the right tool rather</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.730" end="00:41:29.600" style="s2">than not exactly the right tool that had</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.970" style="s2">left them with the wrong impression I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.600" end="00:41:34.550" style="s2">reminded of the story from our first</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.970" end="00:41:37.460" style="s2">long trip to Central America with my</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.550" end="00:41:39.710" style="s2">what 1976 Toyota Corolla and the trip</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.460" end="00:41:41.210" style="s2">would have been in 1993 so this is you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.710" end="00:41:44.330" style="s2">know not a new car and I never had it</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.210" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">when it was new of course and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.330" end="00:41:48.050" style="s2">alternator broke I mean so many things</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:49.250" style="s2">broke on that car but the alternator</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.050" end="00:41:53.690" style="s2">broke at one point we were still in</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.250" end="00:41:56.810" style="s2">northern Mexico and we ended up flagging</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.690" end="00:42:00.500" style="s2">down someone who had a ability to tow it</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.810" end="00:42:01.580" style="s2">to the nearest place nearest town and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.500" end="00:42:03.260" style="s2">said there&#39;s not going to be a new</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.580" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">alternator here right how long are we</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.260" end="00:42:05.840" style="s2">stuck how long are we stuck in this we</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:09.170" style="s2">don&#39;t even know where we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.840" end="00:42:12.050" style="s2">you know northern central desert Mexico</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.170" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">and and the guy said are you kidding me</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.050" end="00:42:17.900" style="s2">I rebuild them and at that point 93 I</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:20.060" style="s2">think that was I can&#39;t read 91 that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.900" end="00:42:21.470" style="s2">would have been action anyone as well I</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.060" end="00:42:24.830" style="s2">would&#39;ve been right before you done you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.470" end="00:42:26.060" style="s2">then went to Jamaica with Bob you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.830" end="00:42:27.740" style="s2">he laughed out it&#39;s like we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.060" end="00:42:29.510" style="s2">don&#39;t use new office notice we rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.740" end="00:42:30.920" style="s2">alternators and there was as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.510" end="00:42:33.560" style="s2">know almost no one to rebuilding</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.920" end="00:42:35.630" style="s2">alternators in the US at that right it</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.560" end="00:42:37.190" style="s2">was it could be done but most people had</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.630" end="00:42:39.020" style="s2">lost the skill no no in fact there was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.190" end="00:42:41.150" style="s2">mechanism you would take your old</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.020" end="00:42:42.980" style="s2">alternator in and you would get 10 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.150" end="00:42:45.170" style="s2">back on your new alter name it was just</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.980" end="00:42:46.850" style="s2">you know court charge all right and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.170" end="00:42:49.760" style="s2">would rebuild it just on this little</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.850" end="00:42:51.950" style="s2">little deviation here I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.760" end="00:42:53.780" style="s2">what he charged us in cash but it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.950" end="00:42:56.120" style="s2">quite low but he also you know we had</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.780" end="00:42:57.860" style="s2">the car completely packed because we</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.120" end="00:42:59.120" style="s2">were gonna be on the road for the summer</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.860" end="00:43:00.710" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t know where it was going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.120" end="00:43:03.140" style="s2">take us and one of the things we had was</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.710" end="00:43:04.910" style="s2">one of these like Costco sized cans of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.140" end="00:43:07.100" style="s2">almonds and so he asked for payment in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.910" end="00:43:08.860" style="s2">cash plus the almonds so yeah those</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.100" end="00:43:11.810" style="s2">almonds that&#39;s the family size cost</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.860" end="00:43:13.850" style="s2">thing elements yeah I still have those</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.810" end="00:43:18.950" style="s2">almonds at least the can I&#39;m sure the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.850" end="00:43:21.830" style="s2">can is being used yeah okay so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.950" end="00:43:23.540" style="s2">go and I see Lexie and the scene is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.830" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">little frightening actually Lexie is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.540" end="00:43:28.370" style="s2">very robust dude mm-hmm but he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:30.350" style="s2">little shaken right and he&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.370" end="00:43:32.620" style="s2">concrete set the scene for the jail is</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.350" end="00:43:34.930" style="s2">he is he alone in the south</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.620" end="00:43:38.020" style="s2">in a cell it&#39;s kind of a big sell but</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.930" end="00:43:40.390" style="s2">he&#39;s alone a cell it&#39;s concrete awful</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.020" end="00:43:42.880" style="s2">mattress and not much more beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.390" end="00:43:46.050" style="s2">but I talked to him I sit down with him</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.880" end="00:43:49.950" style="s2">they let me in and I talked to him and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.050" end="00:43:52.390" style="s2">he tells me that they&#39;ve got him</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.950" end="00:43:54.970" style="s2">cleaning the marijuana that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.390" end="00:43:57.340" style="s2">lifting off of people of the stems and</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:07.420" style="s2">that the at least the excuse the cover</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.560" end="00:44:09.220" style="s2">story for them arresting him was because</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.420" end="00:44:12.280" style="s2">he was in possession of marijuana oh no</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.220" end="00:44:14.380" style="s2">no no no what I think the story was was</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.280" end="00:44:17.650" style="s2">that a I don&#39;t even know why there was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.380" end="00:44:18.850" style="s2">rival family I saw no evidence uh you</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.650" end="00:44:21.220" style="s2">know I saw a little bit of interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.850" end="00:44:22.440" style="s2">conflict sometimes in Jamaica and it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.220" end="00:44:24.280" style="s2">sometimes you know I learned</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.440" end="00:44:25.960" style="s2">interpersonal conflict in Jamaica is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.280" end="00:44:29.470" style="s2">bit louder than it is you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.960" end="00:44:32.230" style="s2">u.s. usually but but anyway all of it</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.890" end="00:44:40.060" style="s2">effectively right but somebody</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.900" end="00:44:41.860" style="s2">apparently reported that the family I</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.060" end="00:44:43.750" style="s2">was staying with had been involved in</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.860" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">some sort of a theft of goods from a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.750" end="00:44:47.320" style="s2">store which I guarantee you didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.980" end="00:45:27.110" style="s2">uncle Bernie has to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.040" end="00:45:29.600" style="s2">to the hardware store to pick up some</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.110" end="00:45:31.070" style="s2">funds for some workers who are working</p>

<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">Vernie goes into the hardware store and</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.890" end="00:45:40.940" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting in the car and a Jamaican</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:42.590" style="s2">guy seems nice enough comes up to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.940" end="00:45:45.130" style="s2">window and asked me if I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.590" end="00:45:46.940" style="s2">smoking a joint and this isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.130" end="00:45:49.700" style="s2">unusual it&#39;s a little unusual</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.940" end="00:45:51.470" style="s2">are you Bob&#39;s at CIA at this point are</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.700" end="00:45:54.020" style="s2">you the only white guy I&#39;m the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.470" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">white guy probably for 10 or 20 miles in</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.020" end="00:45:59.270" style="s2">any direction okay so on the average day</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:01.310" style="s2">the only other person of European</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.270" end="00:46:03.110" style="s2">descent you see is Bob and he&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.310" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">in country at this point right okay um</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.110" end="00:46:06.920" style="s2">which is a very interesting experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:09.230" style="s2">and among the many things I learned is</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.920" end="00:46:11.420" style="s2">that that turns one of the tables but</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.230" end="00:46:12.680" style="s2">not both of them right so it turns the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.420" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">table of yeah you&#39;re actually the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.680" end="00:46:17.720" style="s2">minority and you feel it but the white</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:20.020" style="s2">person is a powerful minority they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.720" end="00:46:22.760" style="s2">understood to be powerful and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.020" end="00:46:24.740" style="s2">this has all kinds of implications that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.760" end="00:46:26.930" style="s2">I find profoundly disturbing like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.740" end="00:46:28.910" style="s2">celebration of lighter-skinned children</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.930" end="00:46:30.740" style="s2">but you know I&#39;m an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.910" end="00:46:34.520" style="s2">biologist I can also tell you why that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.740" end="00:46:36.830" style="s2">is the fact is in a world in which you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.520" end="00:46:38.600" style="s2">know there is something called white</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.830" end="00:46:39.830" style="s2">privilege where something that would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.600" end="00:46:42.310" style="s2">called white privilege if that term</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.830" end="00:46:44.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t being borrowed and abused</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.310" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">lighter-skinned children have</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.120" end="00:46:48.470" style="s2">opportunities that others might not and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:50.630" style="s2">so you know it makes sense for people to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.470" end="00:46:52.910" style="s2">root for such things because it might</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.630" end="00:46:54.890" style="s2">give you a leg up in situation where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.910" end="00:46:57.740" style="s2">would otherwise not get anywhere so no</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.890" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">and the fact is that even when you are a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.740" end="00:47:02.900" style="s2">minority of one in your skin in a place</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:05.030" style="s2">when your skin looks like yours or mine</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.900" end="00:47:07.220" style="s2">you can always choose and at any moment</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.030" end="00:47:09.230" style="s2">you may - you may choose to do just this</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.220" end="00:47:10.580" style="s2">to go back to the place where you are</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.230" end="00:47:12.440" style="s2">not the minority and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.580" end="00:47:14.330" style="s2">experienced this in Madagascar we did as</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.440" end="00:47:17.300" style="s2">well but the time that I was there</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.330" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">without you I really felt it very</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.300" end="00:47:23.540" style="s2">acutely that okay it is yes whenever I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:24.740" style="s2">walk down the street I&#39;m you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.540" end="00:47:25.550" style="s2">only white person for there you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.740" end="00:47:27.290" style="s2">hundreds of miles</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.550" end="00:47:30.680" style="s2">aside from Jessica my field assistant</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.290" end="00:47:32.839" style="s2">and people are intrigued and enchanted</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.680" end="00:47:35.299" style="s2">and scared horrified</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.839" end="00:47:37.729" style="s2">and in northeast Madagascar one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.299" end="00:47:39.259" style="s2">myths is that the monster the demon that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.729" end="00:47:40.670" style="s2">comes and eats children comes in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.259" end="00:47:41.869" style="s2">form of a white woman so occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.670" end="00:47:44.059" style="s2">people like children are actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.869" end="00:47:46.219" style="s2">deathly afraid because I&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.059" end="00:47:48.170" style="s2">one before and you know how that myth</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.219" end="00:47:50.749" style="s2">started in a world without colonialism I</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.170" end="00:47:52.549" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah you know because you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.749" end="00:47:54.349" style="s2">know Madagascar is myths are far older</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.549" end="00:47:58.430" style="s2">than the colonial influence of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.349" end="00:48:02.269" style="s2">French but the fact is that at any</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.430" end="00:48:04.460" style="s2">moment I could have left justice you</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.269" end="00:48:05.809" style="s2">could have left and you did well what</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.460" end="00:48:08.299" style="s2">brings me to the next part of story</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.809" end="00:48:10.700" style="s2">excellent I&#39;m sitting there in Bob&#39;s car</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.299" end="00:48:13.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve this guy has come out who I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.700" end="00:48:15.380" style="s2">know offer to smoke a joint with me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.940" end="00:48:17.509" style="s2">I probably should have said no but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.380" end="00:48:19.729" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a reason to say no and so he</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.509" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">gets in the car and he rolls a joint and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.729" end="00:48:26.569" style="s2">we&#39;re smoking it and he starts talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">to where I&#39;m from and I you know I tell</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.569" end="00:48:33.430" style="s2">him and I say you know he&#39;s I say I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.799" end="00:48:43.099" style="s2">to take back to the states and I say no</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.499" end="00:48:57.739" style="s2">immediately cops in riot gear descend on</p>

<p begin="00:48:57.739" end="00:49:01.460" style="s2">they appear to rough him up and throw</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.059" end="00:49:55.339" style="s2">are hanging out with the wrong people</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.229" end="00:49:59.630" style="s2">and I say and he says and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.339" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">stop and I say I am leaving Jamaica in</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.630" end="00:50:07.219" style="s2">two days and he said that&#39;s too long you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:10.369" style="s2">have to go tonight and then they drive</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.219" end="00:50:12.759" style="s2">off with the guy who had tried to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.369" end="00:50:15.079" style="s2">you to take a bunch of I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.759" end="00:50:16.279" style="s2">yes.can out to agree to take pot I</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.079" end="00:50:20.420" style="s2">believe I was being set up</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.279" end="00:50:21.650" style="s2">yeah exam but in any case they drive off</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.420" end="00:50:23.749" style="s2">and they tell me that I have to leave</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.650" end="00:50:26.569" style="s2">tonight I don&#39;t really have a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.749" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">mechanism for even doing that right but</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.569" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">I more or less decide that&#39;s a bluff and</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:37.969" style="s2">I return to the house and I you know do</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.180" style="s2">what I was planning to do it tell I tell</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.969" end="00:50:44.599" style="s2">your friends you told oh yeah oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.180" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">tell everybody and anyway so I proceed</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.599" end="00:50:49.849" style="s2">with my plans as they were scheduled and</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">I fly out without incident without</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.849" end="00:50:54.140" style="s2">further and without further yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:57.019" style="s2">entirely without incident I&#39;m but an</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.140" end="00:50:59.630" style="s2">Alexei Alexei is released</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.019" end="00:51:03.140" style="s2">weeks later yeah I believe he spent a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.630" end="00:51:05.329" style="s2">good bit of time in jail for an offence</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.140" end="00:51:06.489" style="s2">that was not an offence uh-huh that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.329" end="00:51:10.190" style="s2">nobody would have thought twice about</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.489" end="00:51:12.920" style="s2">except the police doing unpaid work that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.190" end="00:51:16.039" style="s2">was itself part of the same offense</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.920" end="00:51:18.109" style="s2">right yeah exactly so anyway that story</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.039" end="00:51:20.029" style="s2">has a lot of depth to it and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.109" end="00:51:23.439" style="s2">this is the the end of my public life so</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.029" end="00:51:26.900" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s been great and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.439" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">no that&#39;s I that&#39;s that&#39;s fabulous and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.900" end="00:51:32.749" style="s2">there are there are a lot more places to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:36.170" style="s2">go with that but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.749" end="00:51:38.420" style="s2">important to yeah I see why you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.170" end="00:51:39.619" style="s2">want to go there with with Joe because</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.420" end="00:51:41.779" style="s2">it&#39;s a long story</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.619" end="00:51:44.869" style="s2">and you can definitely get dragged into</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.779" end="00:51:46.039" style="s2">a lot of things that maybe you had you</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.869" end="00:51:49.549" style="s2">had more important things to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.039" end="00:51:52.459" style="s2">but the fact that you have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.549" end="00:51:55.910" style="s2">you know abuse at the hands of police</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.459" end="00:51:57.289" style="s2">and watched your friends be abused and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.910" end="00:51:59.420" style="s2">known that they were living a life that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.289" end="00:52:00.739" style="s2">they could not escape that at any moment</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.420" end="00:52:03.859" style="s2">any of them and you know they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.739" end="00:52:06.349" style="s2">you know I assumed yes you told me the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.859" end="00:52:08.660" style="s2">story at the time when you got back but</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.349" end="00:52:10.759" style="s2">I assumed without asking but of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.660" end="00:52:12.469" style="s2">they weren&#39;t roughing up women yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.759" end="00:52:14.089" style="s2">can see that right and yeah I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.469" end="00:52:16.989" style="s2">there are occasionally women you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.089" end="00:52:18.949" style="s2">maybe more so now who are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.989" end="00:52:20.420" style="s2">what the police would view is nefarious</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.949" end="00:52:21.859" style="s2">behaviors and some of them really are</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.420" end="00:52:23.479" style="s2">and so sometimes they do you get roughed</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.859" end="00:52:26.329" style="s2">up but in general it&#39;s gonna be you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.479" end="00:52:28.119" style="s2">active riot geared police raiding houses</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.329" end="00:52:31.400" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be men mostly young men</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.119" end="00:52:37.219" style="s2">who are going to be treated badly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.400" end="00:52:38.660" style="s2">and you you got off once may because</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.219" end="00:52:39.979" style="s2">they didn&#39;t find anything maybe also</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.660" end="00:52:43.640" style="s2">they weren&#39;t looking as hard because you</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.979" end="00:52:44.719" style="s2">were white who knows well but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.640" end="00:52:46.699" style="s2">know I mean I&#39;ve thought a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.719" end="00:52:50.289" style="s2">what this meant what they were hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.699" end="00:52:52.999" style="s2">accomplish I can&#39;t really imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.289" end="00:52:56.209" style="s2">they were gonna pin something on me and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.999" end="00:52:58.400" style="s2">I was gonna end up in a Jamaican prison</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.209" end="00:53:00.049" style="s2">right if I&#39;d been dumb enough to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.400" end="00:53:01.069" style="s2">there&#39;s all your skin privilege this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.049" end="00:53:02.749" style="s2">your nationality</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.069" end="00:53:04.759" style="s2">right government would just not have</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.749" end="00:53:06.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not well it might but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.759" end="00:53:09.529" style="s2">worth the international incident so my</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.920" end="00:53:12.410" style="s2">guess would be maybe I don&#39;t know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.529" end="00:53:14.420" style="s2">they were hoping to extract some okay I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.410" end="00:53:15.859" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t I get the impression they</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.420" end="00:53:19.219" style="s2">didn&#39;t catch the ones that I was there</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.859" end="00:53:21.559" style="s2">until they happened on me unexpectedly</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.219" end="00:53:23.029" style="s2">during their initial raid I sort of have</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.559" end="00:53:25.339" style="s2">the sense that it was organic until that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.029" end="00:53:27.170" style="s2">moment and then something changed but</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.339" end="00:53:30.219" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know there&#39;s something and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.170" end="00:53:33.019" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s important to write that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.219" end="00:53:35.360" style="s2">the dehumanization of the people on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.019" end="00:53:37.490" style="s2">other side be it the police or</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.360" end="00:53:41.530" style="s2">whatever or you know or the protesters</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.490" end="00:53:44.120" style="s2">or you know whatever group it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.530" end="00:53:46.130" style="s2">actually requires that we imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.120" end="00:53:47.900" style="s2">they have simple rules and that they</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.130" end="00:53:50.870" style="s2">live by their pure principles at all</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.900" end="00:53:53.780" style="s2">moments when in fact under times of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.870" end="00:53:55.520" style="s2">duress especially especially if not</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.780" end="00:53:57.880" style="s2">perfectly trained as we know the police</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.520" end="00:53:59.990" style="s2">worldwide not to be perfectly trained</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.880" end="00:54:01.370" style="s2">there are going to be snap decisions</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.990" end="00:54:04.430" style="s2">that aren&#39;t the ones that if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.370" end="00:54:05.780" style="s2">them in in calm measured voices when</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.430" end="00:54:08.450" style="s2">they aren&#39;t under duress what would you</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.780" end="00:54:10.220" style="s2">do different decisions are made this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.450" end="00:54:12.320" style="s2">when poor decision-making happens and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.220" end="00:54:14.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not an excuse or justification</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.320" end="00:54:17.990" style="s2">but rather an explanation in part yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.920" end="00:54:20.720" style="s2">so I should say actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.990" end="00:54:22.040" style="s2">reasons I&#39;m a little reluctant to tell</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.720" end="00:54:25.850" style="s2">the story and I guess the deed is done</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.040" end="00:54:30.290" style="s2">now is I certainly assume that you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.850" end="00:54:32.390" style="s2">30 years later that there&#39;s no harm to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.290" end="00:54:36.950" style="s2">come from this those officers have long</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.390" end="00:54:39.560" style="s2">since moved on presumably everybody gets</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.950" end="00:54:44.210" style="s2">that the story is ancient history but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.560" end="00:54:48.970" style="s2">really did value my time living in</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.210" end="00:54:51.470" style="s2">Jamaica it gave me a window into yes how</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.970" end="00:54:54.110" style="s2">Jamaicans live and how this particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.470" end="00:54:55.880" style="s2">family lived but also just a correction</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.110" end="00:54:57.770" style="s2">you know until you live in another</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.880" end="00:54:59.900" style="s2">culture you only have your own</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.770" end="00:55:01.850" style="s2">experience to go by and so this was so</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.900" end="00:55:04.010" style="s2">eye-opening and so important as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.850" end="00:55:08.950" style="s2">formative experience that I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.010" end="00:55:10.910" style="s2">cherish it and and I I value all of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.950" end="00:55:12.200" style="s2">interactions that I had and all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.910" end="00:55:16.220" style="s2">people that I was living with who</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.200" end="00:55:18.740" style="s2">treated me so well you know if in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.220" end="00:55:21.890" style="s2">u.s. if you brought somebody into your</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.740" end="00:55:23.840" style="s2">house study abroad like right you would</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.890" end="00:55:26.930" style="s2">do your best to be gracious to them but</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.840" end="00:55:30.470" style="s2">it would not be as warm and decent as</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.930" end="00:55:34.700" style="s2">what I experienced among people who had</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.470" end="00:55:36.950" style="s2">really no reason to care for me right at</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.700" end="00:55:38.870" style="s2">some level they they cared for you both</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.950" end="00:55:40.910" style="s2">because they loved Bob and they trusted</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.870" end="00:55:42.620" style="s2">him and he wasn&#39;t bringing through a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.910" end="00:55:44.060" style="s2">whole host of people like you were he</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.620" end="00:55:45.380" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a research assistant every</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.060" end="00:55:46.010" style="s2">year like you were there working with</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.380" end="00:55:48.080" style="s2">him that year</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.010" end="00:55:50.600" style="s2">and I&#39;m just totally guessing here but</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.080" end="00:55:52.100" style="s2">you know maybe one year in five maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.600" end="00:55:54.350" style="s2">would bring someone down to work with</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.100" end="00:55:56.690" style="s2">him right so this was rare this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.350" end="00:55:59.300" style="s2">just a constant sort of circulating</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.690" end="00:56:03.170" style="s2">tribe of random undergraduates from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.300" end="00:56:05.510" style="s2">US but also you know you were real with</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.170" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">them and you were living in their home</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.510" end="00:56:13.880" style="s2">and you were legitimately befriending</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:15.470" style="s2">and you know enjoying the food and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.880" end="00:56:16.670" style="s2">know not complaining about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.470" end="00:56:18.290" style="s2">you were showering with a bucket that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.670" end="00:56:20.090" style="s2">you had to dip into a pool like you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.290" end="00:56:22.100" style="s2">I just like I&#39;ve lived with you in those</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.090" end="00:56:24.080" style="s2">situations and other places and I like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.100" end="00:56:25.490" style="s2">know for sure you didn&#39;t complain you</p>

<p begin="00:57:15.700" end="00:57:20.840" style="s2">but part of the reason to go is that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.650" end="00:57:23.750" style="s2">are now going to be living in someone</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.840" end="00:57:28.250" style="s2">else&#39;s culture among other people and we</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.520" end="00:57:38.660" style="s2">and you know learn to admire the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.130" end="00:57:41.720" style="s2">different ways that different people do</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.660" end="00:57:44.350" style="s2">things and understand you know the ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.720" end="00:57:46.880" style="s2">in which your life as Americans is</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.350" end="00:57:48.770" style="s2">actually privileged and unique and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.880" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">ways that Americans got it wrong too</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.770" end="00:57:53.270" style="s2">you know what have we lost with all of</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:55.010" style="s2">the resources that we&#39;ve got you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.270" end="00:57:57.920" style="s2">this is something that was said to me</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.010" end="00:57:59.450" style="s2">and to us in Madagascar a few times you</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.920" end="00:58:01.700" style="s2">know the observation</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.450" end="00:58:03.110" style="s2">from people that yeah you Americans</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.700" end="00:58:04.580" style="s2">which nearly some very very few</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.110" end="00:58:06.590" style="s2">Americans to the degree they saw any</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.580" end="00:58:08.990" style="s2">vazha any white people it was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.590" end="00:58:10.430" style="s2">French people you Americans seem to show</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.990" end="00:58:12.170" style="s2">up with lots of stuff meaning we had</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.430" end="00:58:13.550" style="s2">boots and backpacks like you know lots</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.170" end="00:58:17.240" style="s2">of stuff meant just that we could you</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.550" end="00:58:18.800" style="s2">know put shoes on our feet but you may</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.240" end="00:58:21.530" style="s2">not have the family connections that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.800" end="00:58:25.970" style="s2">have oh right and you you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.530" end="00:58:28.100" style="s2">also an exchange of wisdom that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.970" end="00:58:32.300" style="s2">thought was really profound so I recall</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.100" end="00:58:35.860" style="s2">I often invoke uncle Bernie uncle Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.300" end="00:58:38.060" style="s2">was a great guy as a mechanic yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.860" end="00:58:40.760" style="s2">he was one of these guys who was just</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.060" end="00:58:42.470" style="s2">you know super capable of figuring out a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.760" end="00:58:44.330" style="s2">solution when the thing that you you</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.470" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">know when they the a level solution</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.330" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t available he had you know B</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">through Z you know somewhere in his</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:53.600" style="s2">arsenal but I remember one day I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:56.870" style="s2">trying to I was trying to lubricate my</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.600" end="00:59:00.650" style="s2">bicycle chain and I didn&#39;t have bike cam</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.870" end="00:59:04.610" style="s2">lubricant and he brought me some corn</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.650" end="00:59:07.550" style="s2">oil and I was like I&#39;m not so sure he</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.610" end="00:59:11.240" style="s2">said Bret the wrong lubricant is better</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.550" end="00:59:12.770" style="s2">than no lubricant and to this day and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.240" end="00:59:13.640" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a couple of instances</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.770" end="00:59:16.540" style="s2">where that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.640" end="00:59:21.410" style="s2">I like the pawls of a ratchet but why</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.540" end="00:59:24.140" style="s2">because if you put a lubricant that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.410" end="00:59:26.180" style="s2">too thick they can stick but in most</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.140" end="00:59:27.680" style="s2">cases you know there might be a best</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.180" end="00:59:29.030" style="s2">lubricant but what you really need is</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.680" end="00:59:30.460" style="s2">something to lubricate the things cuz</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.030" end="00:59:33.410" style="s2">otherwise they rub together and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.460" end="00:59:34.760" style="s2">terribly the apparatus apart but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.410" end="00:59:36.920" style="s2">there&#39;s that but then there was also the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.760" end="00:59:38.780" style="s2">other thing which I found I still think</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.920" end="00:59:41.840" style="s2">about it a lot which is there was this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.780" end="00:59:44.930" style="s2">gaggle of kids who ranged from very very</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.840" end="00:59:48.800" style="s2">young like like three three yeah two</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.930" end="00:59:52.580" style="s2">kids who were maybe you know 12 13 14</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.800" end="00:59:55.730" style="s2">and they were they were really fond of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.580" end="00:59:57.380" style="s2">me because I would answer the questions</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.730" end="01:00:00.980" style="s2">and they had a lot of bad information</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.380" end="01:00:04.820" style="s2">coming to them a lot of it over you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.980" end="01:00:06.440" style="s2">TV and stuff a bad info and American TV</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.820" end="01:00:08.870" style="s2">is what they&#39;re being exposed to mostly</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.440" end="01:00:12.320" style="s2">yeah now they find they find me</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.870" end="01:00:13.190" style="s2">confusing because I frequently tell them</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.320" end="01:00:15.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand what</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.190" end="01:00:17.480" style="s2">asking me because they speak in patois</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.230" end="01:00:19.940" style="s2">and my pathway is weak and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.480" end="01:00:21.800" style="s2">even recognize the kids don&#39;t that they</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.940" end="01:00:24.970" style="s2">too language because there&#39;s code</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.800" end="01:00:28.250" style="s2">switching between school English and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.970" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">patois and school English is not patois</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.250" end="01:00:31.640" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s American English it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:36.829" style="s2">American English yes with a British</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.640" end="01:00:38.390" style="s2">accent but but anyway it&#39;s so this</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.829" end="01:00:39.800" style="s2">gaggle of kids was you know they were</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.390" end="01:00:42.770" style="s2">constantly following me around and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.800" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">remember I was reading The Unbearable</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.770" end="01:00:46.970" style="s2">Lightness of being I think was my book</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:48.829" style="s2">the nervous reading yes and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.970" end="01:00:51.230" style="s2">point at which I think it may be the end</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.829" end="01:00:54.619" style="s2">of the book I hope I&#39;m remembering this</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.230" end="01:00:57.020" style="s2">correctly there&#39;s a scene where they</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.619" end="01:00:59.569" style="s2">have to euthanize their own dog and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.020" end="01:01:04.130" style="s2">knew I was gonna cry and I wanted to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.569" end="01:01:05.810" style="s2">alone but this guy would not they would</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.130" end="01:01:07.849" style="s2">not take the hint and so everywhere I</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.810" end="01:01:13.220" style="s2">found a quiet place like kids would</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.849" end="01:01:14.599" style="s2">descend so anyway yeah so what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.220" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">remember it was one of the kids or</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.599" end="01:01:19.310" style="s2">someone else who asked you is the moon</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:20.930" style="s2">that we see in Jamaica the same moon</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.310" end="01:01:23.540" style="s2">that you see in the United States yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.930" end="01:01:25.430" style="s2">that was Prince it&#39;s a great question oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.540" end="01:01:28.359" style="s2">yeah and it just it points you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.430" end="01:01:31.010" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s honest inquiry there and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.359" end="01:01:32.599" style="s2">you know unless you too can answer all</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.010" end="01:01:34.010" style="s2">the questions on that list that you made</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.599" end="01:01:35.540" style="s2">about why the seasons and why the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.010" end="01:01:38.420" style="s2">Solstice and why the two tides and all</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.540" end="01:01:40.099" style="s2">of this yeah don&#39;t feel superior to</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.420" end="01:01:41.630" style="s2">someone asking a question like that just</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.099" end="01:01:43.550" style="s2">because that happens to be one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.630" end="01:01:45.740" style="s2">things that managed to get through</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.550" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">education you know get through to you in</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.740" end="01:01:50.300" style="s2">education oh and especially you know I</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:52.910" style="s2">remember being kind of dismayed at one</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.300" end="01:01:55.490" style="s2">point I found a copy of the Weekly World</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.910" end="01:01:57.170" style="s2">News mm-hmm and the problem is Weekly</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.490" end="01:01:59.180" style="s2">World News looks like a newspaper</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.170" end="01:02:01.579" style="s2">so he&#39;s telling its how its it was the</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.180" end="01:02:03.380" style="s2">most ridiculous of okay you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.579" end="01:02:07.790" style="s2">think the particular issue I was looking</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.380" end="01:02:10.579" style="s2">at a woman had given birth to an otter</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.790" end="01:02:12.619" style="s2">or something I mean just pure nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.579" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">right it&#39;s lizard people before its time</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.619" end="01:02:17.660" style="s2">yeah exactly and so anyway you got just</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:19.550" style="s2">garbagey information that in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.660" end="01:02:21.140" style="s2">you would know to discount but it shows</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.550" end="01:02:22.760" style="s2">up looking like a newspaper in a place</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.140" end="01:02:24.290" style="s2">where they don&#39;t even have they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.760" end="01:02:26.740" style="s2">connected by phone so there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.290" end="01:02:30.230" style="s2">correct bad info</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.740" end="01:02:31.609" style="s2">so but high literacy so you know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.230" end="01:02:33.230" style="s2">something like that falls into people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.609" end="01:02:34.490" style="s2">hands and they actually don&#39;t take it in</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.230" end="01:02:36.290" style="s2">which it is actually you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.490" end="01:02:38.450" style="s2">potentially a downside of literacy in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.290" end="01:02:39.800" style="s2">place without good written word yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.450" end="01:02:42.080" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t think of that downside of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.800" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">literacy but but it potentially is one</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.080" end="01:02:47.060" style="s2">but anyway so the thing you know for</p>

<p begin="01:02:51.349" end="01:02:55.340" style="s2">led to several different discussions</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.760" end="01:03:10.520" style="s2">could go down that rabbit hole and we</p>

<p begin="01:03:10.520" end="01:03:14.390" style="s2">over an hour already and there were many</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.220" end="01:03:15.859" style="s2">other things that we wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.390" end="01:03:17.960" style="s2">about them maybe we have not talked</p>

<p begin="01:03:26.869" end="01:03:29.930" style="s2">wanted to finish with but given that</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.900" end="01:04:06.980" style="s2">now had this to say very short quote but</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:08.950" style="s2">it seems like it it&#39;s a nice finish to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.980" end="01:04:11.210" style="s2">us talking about the solstice to begin</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.950" end="01:04:13.460" style="s2">he says life is tragic</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.210" end="01:04:15.500" style="s2">simply because the earth turns and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.460" end="01:04:17.480" style="s2">Sun inexorably rises and sets and one</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.500" end="01:04:20.780" style="s2">day for each of us the Sun will go down</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.480" end="01:04:21.680" style="s2">for the last last time perhaps the whole</p>

<p begin="01:04:21.680" end="01:04:25.099" style="s2">the human trouble is that we will</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.480" end="01:04:27.890" style="s2">sacrifice all the beauty of our lives</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.099" end="01:04:30.890" style="s2">will imprison ourselves in totems taboos</p>

<p begin="01:04:38.119" end="01:04:42.019" style="s2">it seems to me that one ought to rejoice</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.130" end="01:04:43.700" style="s2">in the fact of death ought to decide</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.019" end="01:04:46.700" style="s2">indeed to earn ones death by confronting</p>
