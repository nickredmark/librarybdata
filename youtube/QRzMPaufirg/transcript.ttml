<p begin="00:00:00.439" end="00:00:05.609" style="s2">so Charles Eisenstein released a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.810" end="00:00:09.110" style="s2">videos over the last few weeks on</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.609" end="00:00:12.389" style="s2">masculinity and femininity and I love</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.110" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">99% of what that man says and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:16.410" style="s2">like that when anyone talks at masculine</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:17.960" style="s2">femininity if anyone&#39;s going to I feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">like he&#39;s probably a good one to do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.960" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">but he said the thing that they all say</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:25.800" style="s2">that is which is that in order to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.730" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">sexual charge you need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">masculine and feminine polarity that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">were batteries for magnets you need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">have one or the other that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:35.850" style="s2">polarity comes from and part of me</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:37.500" style="s2">believed that for decades it&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.850" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">learned from Ken Wilbur&#39;s work and when</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.500" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned from David data and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">not true if you have to try to be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">positive and someone else to try to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:50.430" style="s2">the negative in order to create a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">polarity that is nowhere near as much</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.430" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">charge and energy as just being your</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.949" end="00:00:57.809" style="s2">authentic self and finding someone that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">is also being authentic and do you match</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">or not is there sexual chemistry instead</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:03.899" style="s2">of trying to make there be sexual</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">chemistry if there isn&#39;t it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.899" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">one of us is being the wrong thing one</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">of us isn&#39;t masculine enough one of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t feminine enough or you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:15.650" style="s2">sexual chemistry because that sexual</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">chemistry does actually dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.650" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">actually dissipates over time whereas</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">being your authentic self and constantly</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">growing you know you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:26.220" style="s2">continually change and so they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:29.070" style="s2">continually change if what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.220" end="00:01:33.530" style="s2">do is try to be masculine or try to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.070" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">feminine you&#39;re not doing it right I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.530" end="00:01:39.030" style="s2">just don&#39;t understand why you would want</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:41.450" style="s2">to try to be something new or not if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">are feminine if you are masculine</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.450" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">independent of what your body is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">doing it right do you want to play with</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">dolls do you want to wrestle do you want</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">to wear pink do you want to wear blue</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">none of those things are reliant they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">highly correlated but not reliant on</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">what your body looks like not reliant on</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">what your sex or gender are and so for</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">masculine feminine into back into gender</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">and sex is like where it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:13.700" style="s2">starts to break for me because if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.700" style="s2">have to try to be masculine</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.100" end="00:02:20.890" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s broken why do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.819" end="00:02:25.090" style="s2">try to be it you either are it or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.890" end="00:02:27.730" style="s2">not if you are broken as a man because</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.090" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">they&#39;re not masculine enough what does</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.730" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">that mean especially on the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:37.750" style="s2">side which is thought of as as</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:39.670" style="s2">intelligent and brave it&#39;s neither</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.750" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">intelligent or brave to try to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.670" end="00:02:43.690" style="s2">something you&#39;re not just to fit into</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">society it doesn&#39;t bring you happiness</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.690" end="00:02:47.620" style="s2">so it&#39;s not intelligent and it&#39;s not out</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:49.239" style="s2">of out of alignment of what everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.620" end="00:02:52.300" style="s2">else is doing so it doesn&#39;t really take</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.239" end="00:02:53.500" style="s2">bravery and so when all of society says</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.300" end="00:02:57.459" style="s2">to a little boy you&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.500" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">masculine and he&#39;s feminine that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.459" end="00:03:01.959" style="s2">bravery</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">it would not be bravery for that little</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.959" end="00:03:05.500" style="s2">masculine boy to pretend to be feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:06.130" style="s2">or for the little feminine boy tend to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.500" end="00:03:08.620" style="s2">be masculine</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.130" end="00:03:10.989" style="s2">it&#39;s whatever naturally arises in you so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.620" end="00:03:12.840" style="s2">to raise generations of children to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.989" end="00:03:15.069" style="s2">who they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.840" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">including embracing all of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.069" end="00:03:17.950" style="s2">masculine characteristics all of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:20.709" style="s2">feminine characteristics are they</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.950" end="00:03:23.530" style="s2">characteristics they want to have are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.709" end="00:03:24.940" style="s2">they things they want to pursue not you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.530" end="00:03:26.680" style="s2">have to go in just this sport because</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.940" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">you&#39;re a boy or you have to go into this</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.680" end="00:03:31.209" style="s2">sport because you&#39;re a girl or this art</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">because you&#39;re a girl do you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.209" end="00:03:37.180" style="s2">it does it inspire you does it feel good</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.360" end="00:03:40.360" style="s2">to be there then do it otherwise don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.180" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">check in on yourself not whether it fits</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.360" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">under the masculine or feminine umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:50.079" style="s2">and that is part of my life&#39;s mission</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:52.269" style="s2">helping people figure out helping me</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.079" end="00:03:54.070" style="s2">figure out my most authentic self and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.269" end="00:03:56.709" style="s2">constantly figure out where I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.070" end="00:03:58.630" style="s2">to be something for a society and where</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.709" end="00:04:00.609" style="s2">I&#39;m allowing something to merge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.630" end="00:04:03.850" style="s2">uniquely mine and I want the uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.609" end="00:04:06.010" style="s2">mine part F the society part and I want</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.850" end="00:04:07.390" style="s2">other people to get on that path because</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.010" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">I know how much happiness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.390" end="00:04:11.829" style="s2">authenticity is there and I know we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">unlock together when a tiny handful of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.829" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">us start doing that then we call them</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:16.780" style="s2">the masses and more and more of us start</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:20.680" style="s2">doing that that is where the power lies</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.780" end="00:04:22.330" style="s2">and you can&#39;t co-opt that not in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.680" end="00:04:24.430" style="s2">same way you can co-op masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.330" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">femininity the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.430" end="00:04:28.629" style="s2">because when you don&#39;t have a buy-in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.090" style="s2">when it&#39;s about what naturally emerges</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.629" end="00:04:34.150" style="s2">from inside of you even if it&#39;s a binary</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.090" end="00:04:37.180" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter masculine feminine</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.150" end="00:04:39.340" style="s2">male/female boy-girl no no matters who</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.180" end="00:04:41.500" style="s2">are you and can you show up as your best</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.340" end="00:04:41.710" style="s2">self and when you don&#39;t can we forgive</p>

<p begin="00:04:41.710" end="00:04:46.449" style="s2">and can we love each other in that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:48.370" style="s2">can we help each other become the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.449" end="00:04:50.680" style="s2">versions of ourselves and be the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.370" end="00:04:53.310" style="s2">version of our own self without having</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:04:55.240" style="s2">an outside metric that we are either</p>
