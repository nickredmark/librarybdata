<p begin="00:03:20.110" end="00:03:27.050" style="s2">yeah I mean ad D and concentration</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:35.810" style="s2">audio and visual stimulation so then I</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.590" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing with tech we need more of a</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:55.130" style="s2">this is a this is unser when I speak</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:58.880" style="s2">about the the benefits of Technology I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.130" end="00:04:02.180" style="s2">want to emphasize the way it currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.880" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">is is not the thing it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.180" end="00:04:06.380" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a lot of branching off</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:12.200" style="s2">points here I mean the one the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.380" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">that I&#39;m really struck by is daniel</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.200" end="00:04:17.660" style="s2">trachtenberg who talks about this that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:20.900" style="s2">addiction is the most the the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.660" end="00:04:21.170" style="s2">profitable form of capitalism or the</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.190" end="00:04:28.940" style="s2">your customer addicted to something so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:30.980" style="s2">know we&#39;d like to kind of unpack it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.940" end="00:04:33.470" style="s2">maybe talk about how technology might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.980" end="00:04:38.980" style="s2">used in another way but isn&#39;t the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.470" end="00:04:41.900" style="s2">question how in inherently exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.980" end="00:04:43.160" style="s2">dynamic how can you move away from that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.900" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">because all of the incentives are</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.160" end="00:04:47.540" style="s2">leading in the other direction yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:50.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a massive question and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.540" end="00:04:53.180" style="s2">question and can we build not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.740" end="00:04:56.830" style="s2">competitive as in when I&#39;m usually were</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.180" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">competitive I mean I&#39;m successful</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.830" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">non-addictive tools in a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:05.720" style="s2">system because ultimately are because of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:08.690" style="s2">our especially with mobile phone</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:11.330" style="s2">software our profit models are based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.690" end="00:05:14.270" style="s2">ad revenue an ad revenue is contingent</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.330" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">upon how much time the user is spent on</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.270" end="00:05:20.300" style="s2">screen obviously if you&#39;re a company and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:23.810" style="s2">you&#39;re looking to maximize shareholder</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.300" end="00:05:27.110" style="s2">value as is in your duty and profit</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.810" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">maximization and you can choose to to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.110" end="00:05:32.330" style="s2">have your your consumers in the screen</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:34.100" style="s2">for 10 seconds versus 5 seconds you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.330" end="00:05:36.830" style="s2">gonna choose the former it&#39;s it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.100" end="00:05:38.630" style="s2">into the economics and the set attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.830" end="00:05:40.850" style="s2">economy is trust and in the center for</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.630" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">human technology speak to it and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.850" end="00:05:47.210" style="s2">a extremely distorting and so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:49.820" style="s2">think ultimately what a new paradigm of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.210" end="00:05:52.550" style="s2">technology has to look like is some sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.820" end="00:05:57.080" style="s2">of juxtaposition of a new tool with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.550" end="00:05:59.660" style="s2">new system that doesn&#39;t just reward the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.080" end="00:06:04.460" style="s2">in which addiction isn&#39;t the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.660" end="00:06:06.860" style="s2">emergent outcome so and I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.460" end="00:06:08.600" style="s2">to hear you talk a bit more about those</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.860" end="00:06:10.700" style="s2">technologies sort of the technological</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.600" end="00:06:13.760" style="s2">side of things before maybe we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.700" end="00:06:16.280" style="s2">swing back round to whether that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.760" end="00:06:18.980" style="s2">possible to shift wholesale towards that</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.280" end="00:06:22.040" style="s2">within what you might call the game a or</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.980" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">a kind of rival hrus capitalist economy</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.040" end="00:06:25.760" style="s2">yeah I want one thing I want to say a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">big emphasis of consciousness hacking is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.760" end="00:06:29.990" style="s2">not really is is is not just what are we</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.990" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">from and we have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:38.630" style="s2">that the things that we build and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:42.190" style="s2">which we create are expressions and</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.509" end="00:07:12.280" style="s2">think a big part of this consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:21.949" style="s2">that differently if we do not start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.880" end="00:07:25.550" style="s2">build from a more integrated place and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.949" end="00:07:27.669" style="s2">we continue to have many you know 25</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.550" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">year old programmers with exponential</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.180" end="00:07:41.180" style="s2">thing we need to build our tools from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.599" end="00:07:43.009" style="s2">deeper place a place of wisdom and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.180" end="00:07:45.770" style="s2">think what you feel and what a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.009" end="00:07:49.099" style="s2">feel is that our tech process is so out</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.770" end="00:07:53.210" style="s2">of alignment with deeper wisdom life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.099" end="00:07:55.389" style="s2">natural flow that has to shift but for</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.210" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">that to shift we need to feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.389" end="00:07:59.150" style="s2">reorientation for what Tech is all about</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:01.370" style="s2">is it about extracting from the ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.150" end="00:08:03.830" style="s2">in a linear way that isn&#39;t circular no</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.370" end="00:08:05.659" style="s2">is it a bit addicting people no is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.830" end="00:08:08.719" style="s2">about causing exponential species level</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.659" end="00:08:13.130" style="s2">harm no for and it&#39;s out of alignment</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.719" end="00:08:15.139" style="s2">with the deeper impulse of life and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.130" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">think we all feel that I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.139" end="00:08:18.259" style="s2">people have there&#39;s resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">technology and it&#39;s a very intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.259" end="00:08:25.550" style="s2">resistance it&#39;s plastic it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:28.310" style="s2">not sustainable we need to be careful as</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.550" end="00:08:30.919" style="s2">to what we are actually scaling and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.310" end="00:08:32.690" style="s2">big part of what we focus on is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.919" end="00:08:34.610" style="s2">build from deeper and deeper places of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.690" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">consciousness I&#39;d love to get a few</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.610" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">examples I&#39;ve heard you talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:42.440" style="s2">before so lot to get some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:45.260" style="s2">examples of how tech could be used in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.440" end="00:08:45.410" style="s2">different way or it or is being used in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.260" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.410" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">different way yeah so I spoke just just</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">there to the inputs and detect where</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">we&#39;re building from and then we also</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:58.730" style="s2">have to ask what what are we actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.470" end="00:09:00.740" style="s2">building for the tools what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.730" end="00:09:02.540" style="s2">interested in is how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.740" end="00:09:03.430" style="s2">technology actually nourishing to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.540" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">human being</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.430" end="00:09:10.579" style="s2">let&#39;s see Tech is on a scale of -10 to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:13.610" style="s2">+10 -10 being it does utmost harm plus</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.579" end="00:09:16.970" style="s2">10 saying it does like the art more good</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.610" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">a lot of our tech is probably a level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.970" end="00:09:21.949" style="s2">maybe - 3 or minus 4 - the human</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:24.829" style="s2">experience a lot of people are calling</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.949" end="00:09:27.769" style="s2">for tech to be at a zero it&#39;s ethical</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.829" end="00:09:28.939" style="s2">it&#39;s neutral or were saying is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.769" end="00:09:30.939" style="s2">would it look like if tech actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.939" end="00:09:33.970" style="s2">brought us closer together</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.939" end="00:09:36.459" style="s2">deeper deepened our human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.970" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">helped to rather than hindered our</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.459" end="00:09:40.850" style="s2">emotional psychological and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:43.220" style="s2">development and so for example you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.850" end="00:09:44.870" style="s2">version 1.0 of a consciousness hacking</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.220" end="00:09:47.930" style="s2">technology would be something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.870" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">biofeedback from meditation you wear a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.930" end="00:09:52.730" style="s2">brain a headband like the muse it gives</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:55.100" style="s2">you audio signals as to whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.730" end="00:09:56.959" style="s2">you&#39;re in a meditative state or not they</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.100" end="00:10:00.220" style="s2">augments and encourages the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:10:02.899" style="s2">process and you can actually massively</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.220" end="00:10:05.800" style="s2">improve performance it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.899" end="00:10:09.290" style="s2">wrong word to use for meditation but</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.800" end="00:10:12.380" style="s2">m-make the the the learning look more</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.290" end="00:10:14.209" style="s2">effective so there&#39;s biofeedback tools</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.380" end="00:10:16.370" style="s2">there&#39;s even headspace or waking up on</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.209" end="00:10:18.139" style="s2">your phone as a meditation tech but</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.370" end="00:10:18.769" style="s2">that&#39;s all just like version 1.0 of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.139" end="00:10:20.630" style="s2">what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.769" end="00:10:24.110" style="s2">this is often called transformative</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.630" end="00:10:26.149" style="s2">technologies version 2 there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.110" end="00:10:26.589" style="s2">really more advanced stuff coming out</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.149" end="00:10:29.029" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.589" end="00:10:31.639" style="s2">for example you&#39;ve heard me speak before</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.029" end="00:10:34.100" style="s2">about ultrasonic neuromodulation which</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.639" end="00:10:35.899" style="s2">is ultra sound to the brain which j</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.100" end="00:10:37.699" style="s2">Sanguinetti and shenzhen young the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.899" end="00:10:39.829" style="s2">meditation teacher is shenzhen and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.699" end="00:10:42.939" style="s2">cheese researcher researcher at</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.829" end="00:10:46.699" style="s2">University of Arizona I&#39;m assured that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.939" end="00:10:48.860" style="s2">isolating some very small ultrasound</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.699" end="00:10:51.439" style="s2">waves to a very specific part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.860" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">brain can lead to massive reductions in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.439" end="00:10:55.220" style="s2">internal now</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:56.780" style="s2">and self rumination so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.220" end="00:10:58.100" style="s2">you know if people are one in four</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.780" end="00:11:00.020" style="s2">people in the UK have a mental health</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.100" end="00:11:02.540" style="s2">disorder any one time what if they had</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.020" end="00:11:04.850" style="s2">access to tools that could help to calm</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.540" end="00:11:06.740" style="s2">down their nervous systems heal from</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.850" end="00:11:09.470" style="s2">their trauma this stuff is actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.740" end="00:11:11.540" style="s2">beginning to emerge that&#39;s on the mental</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.470" end="00:11:13.400" style="s2">health side of things but then you also</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.540" end="00:11:15.770" style="s2">look at the more systemic impact so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.400" end="00:11:17.960" style="s2">example the climate change narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.770" end="00:11:19.490" style="s2">failing right now because reason and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.960" end="00:11:22.670" style="s2">science doesn&#39;t seem to be getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.490" end="00:11:24.020" style="s2">through in terms of that policy and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.670" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">think a large part of that is because</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.020" end="00:11:30.440" style="s2">ideas and operate at one level but</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:33.650" style="s2">experience can deepens into another and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.440" end="00:11:35.930" style="s2">so some studies have come out that show</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.650" end="00:11:38.200" style="s2">that seeing a coral reef or one study in</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.930" end="00:11:41.090" style="s2">particular seeing a coral reef and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.200" end="00:11:45.140" style="s2">decimate and virtual-reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.090" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">and one experience leads to the user</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.140" end="00:11:50.870" style="s2">actually having a marked reduction in</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:52.700" style="s2">things like energy consumption increase</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.870" end="00:11:54.620" style="s2">in recycling months and months down the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.700" end="00:11:56.420" style="s2">line from that single experience you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.620" end="00:11:58.970" style="s2">use the same BR for empathy things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.420" end="00:12:01.070" style="s2">that so there are tools out there that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.970" end="00:12:03.170" style="s2">we can say okay what if we actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.070" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">harness this power for deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.170" end="00:12:09.710" style="s2">levels higher states and higher stages</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:13.370" style="s2">of consciousness it&#39;s possible and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.710" end="00:12:16.460" style="s2">happening and the different framing of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.370" end="00:12:20.930" style="s2">that would be what if if we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.460" end="00:12:23.530" style="s2">that we&#39;re we&#39;re just building tools</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.930" end="00:12:28.540" style="s2">that are amplifying some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.530" end="00:12:33.050" style="s2">basic human tendencies and pathologies</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.540" end="00:12:34.760" style="s2">yeah I mean in my more positive moments</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.050" end="00:12:38.210" style="s2">I can kind of think okay we&#39;ve got we</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.760" end="00:12:41.060" style="s2">had the first wave of tech and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.210" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">Twitter they&#39;re reinforcing all of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.060" end="00:12:45.170" style="s2">of the worst aspect and narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:49.240" style="s2">biases I desire to be seen I desire to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.170" end="00:12:53.180" style="s2">be validated and also optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.240" end="00:12:55.190" style="s2">outrage and for limbic hijack to keep us</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.180" end="00:12:57.890" style="s2">on site and in all of these things sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.190" end="00:12:59.270" style="s2">of and in my more optimistic moment oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.890" end="00:13:01.880" style="s2">well that&#39;s not built into the tech</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.270" end="00:13:05.060" style="s2">there it could be possible for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.880" end="00:13:07.250" style="s2">to have a social media site based around</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.060" end="00:13:09.160" style="s2">what we know about people&#39;s growth</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.250" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">patterns like how do you become more</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.160" end="00:13:14.660" style="s2">open-minded how do you see more people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:16.310" style="s2">perspectives how do you encounter views</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.660" end="00:13:18.829" style="s2">that challenge what you think and lead</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.310" end="00:13:20.870" style="s2">you to a more developed perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.829" end="00:13:24.380" style="s2">etc etcetera all of these things could</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.870" end="00:13:27.260" style="s2">be possible or designing it around yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.380" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">a trajectory of growth individualized</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.260" end="00:13:32.329" style="s2">for an individual person that for</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:35.420" style="s2">example could be possible but then we</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.329" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">run into the difficulty of thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.420" end="00:13:39.769" style="s2">the reason that these platforms are</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">optimized for this is because that is</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:46.459" style="s2">outrages is makes for a sticky site that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.140" end="00:13:48.230" style="s2">means that people are interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.459" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">it and it seems difficult to see how</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.230" end="00:13:53.089" style="s2">anything oriented towards a more</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:56.450" style="s2">holistic vision for want of a better</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.089" end="00:13:58.550" style="s2">word would be able to compete in a</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.550" end="00:14:05.329" style="s2">oriented around stickiness and outrage</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.700" end="00:14:09.800" style="s2">and those features I agree it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.329" end="00:14:11.899" style="s2">very very tough to imagine this given</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.800" end="00:14:13.430" style="s2">the economic incentives that would there</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.899" end="00:14:18.230" style="s2">suggest we are inevitably going</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.430" end="00:14:21.230" style="s2">somewhere else but tech is like tech is</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.230" end="00:14:25.339" style="s2">an amplifier the amplifiers skill and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.230" end="00:14:27.290" style="s2">amplifies as potency and where I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.339" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">to with this argument is really my big</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.290" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">interest is in consciousness my but my</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:32.930" style="s2">interest is more in the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:36.529" style="s2">piece I think than the actual tech piece</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.930" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">but I came to the conclusion that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.529" end="00:14:39.949" style="s2">problems of the world are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:41.870" style="s2">problems of human consciousness a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.949" end="00:14:45.470" style="s2">certain level of development and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.870" end="00:14:48.350" style="s2">certain state of mind and things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.470" end="00:14:50.899" style="s2">psychedelics meditation retreats lucid</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.350" end="00:14:54.890" style="s2">dreaming a lot of these interventions</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.550" end="00:15:04.459" style="s2">reasons Tech has this exponential</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.130" end="00:15:06.740" style="s2">capacity to scale it&#39;s also abundance as</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.740" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">fashion and so the the the question is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.209" end="00:15:19.480" style="s2">is we have this capacity to scale tech</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">and if we were to reorient that towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.480" end="00:15:24.920" style="s2">human flourishing then what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:26.660" style="s2">world would we create and really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.920" end="00:15:29.870" style="s2">not gonna be easy and yet at the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.660" end="00:15:32.300" style="s2">time tech companies work in hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.870" end="00:15:32.870" style="s2">and me living out in San Francisco in</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">importance of a holistic approach so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.709" end="00:15:54.199" style="s2">think if there is sufficient momentum</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:58.459" style="s2">and drive from these leaders I think we</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.199" end="00:16:00.529" style="s2">can start to create a change I think it</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.459" end="00:16:03.050" style="s2">has to be juxtaposed with I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.529" end="00:16:04.850" style="s2">you rightly say some sort of incentives</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.050" end="00:16:08.449" style="s2">change let me let me see it this</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.850" end="00:16:10.279" style="s2">differently this I think the merging of</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.510" end="00:22:12.610" style="s2">I think as we increase our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.120" end="00:22:14.340" style="s2">do harm through tech we also increase</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">our capacity to do good and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.340" end="00:22:18.940" style="s2">consciousness hacking speaks on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:20.800" style="s2">side of the movement that says hey this</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.940" end="00:22:23.890" style="s2">way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.800" end="00:22:27.160" style="s2">what gives you confidence that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.890" end="00:22:28.540" style="s2">possible for us to choose the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.160" end="00:22:31.230" style="s2">positive path rather than the negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.540" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">path that we seem to be on at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.230" end="00:22:46.210" style="s2">or is it more of a hope both a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.270" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">things a lot of the people who I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.210" end="00:22:50.440" style="s2">the opportunity to come into contact</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:52.690" style="s2">with in San Francisco are people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.440" end="00:22:57.570" style="s2">have been very successful at say gamy</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.690" end="00:23:02.730" style="s2">and there&#39;s liquidity going this way and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.570" end="00:23:05.050" style="s2">there is also just a deep human need the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.730" end="00:23:07.450" style="s2">eventually we woke up to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.050" end="00:23:09.910" style="s2">cigarettes were bad for us and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.450" end="00:23:11.230" style="s2">stuff had to change and I think at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.910" end="00:23:13.470" style="s2">same thing you know the Matins up to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.230" end="00:23:15.870" style="s2">some degree the man does create supply</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.470" end="00:23:17.710" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s this combination of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.870" end="00:23:19.630" style="s2">people who are at the top of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.710" end="00:23:22.500" style="s2">so-called tech hierarchy in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.630" end="00:23:25.300" style="s2">experience wakening up waking up to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.500" end="00:23:27.040" style="s2">necessity for their shift and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.300" end="00:23:29.050" style="s2">inevitable rise in people saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.040" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">like this thing good enough I&#39;m addicted</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.050" end="00:23:39.340" style="s2">I&#39;m addicted yeah I emphasize this point</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:42.250" style="s2">this merging of the the techno mystic I</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.340" end="00:23:44.890" style="s2">think is going to be a very key part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.250" end="00:23:47.470" style="s2">this transition to game be but we need a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.890" end="00:23:49.179" style="s2">holistic reframing of every single part</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.470" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">from the design process to the output</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.179" end="00:23:55.960" style="s2">process yeah when you talk you talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.040" end="00:23:58.179" style="s2">before about kind of the idea of maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.960" end="00:24:01.390" style="s2">button that gave you a kind of peak</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.179" end="00:24:04.360" style="s2">state and the dangers of that so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.390" end="00:24:06.350" style="s2">of traditional spirituality or</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.360" end="00:24:08.630" style="s2">traditional meditation practice all</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.350" end="00:24:11.059" style="s2">about kinda hard the hard work of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.630" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">getting there and sustaining and and is</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.059" end="00:24:15.020" style="s2">there a danger that the all of these are</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:19.400" style="s2">the technological solutions are just</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.020" end="00:24:20.870" style="s2">shortcuts yeah and some people say there</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.400" end="00:24:25.010" style="s2">are they they&#39;re crutches that will</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.870" end="00:24:27.260" style="s2">become reliant upon so I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.010" end="00:24:30.020" style="s2">imagine technology to be something I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.260" end="00:24:32.120" style="s2">to e to that is currently used in</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.020" end="00:24:35.539" style="s2">meditation for example focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.120" end="00:24:37.940" style="s2">breath it&#39;s a tool that we&#39;re using as</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.539" end="00:24:40.760" style="s2">an object which is eventually meant to</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.940" end="00:24:43.490" style="s2">be let go of I think the same with</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.760" end="00:24:47.150" style="s2">technology is can we use technology as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.490" end="00:24:50.390" style="s2">tool that serves a certain purpose along</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.150" end="00:24:54.049" style="s2">one&#39;s own developmental path and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.390" end="00:24:55.100" style="s2">when you&#39;re ready you can let go so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.049" end="00:24:56.659" style="s2">think that&#39;s what it&#39;s really like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.100" end="00:24:59.179" style="s2">skillful means we did this conference</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.659" end="00:25:01.070" style="s2">awaken futures and Mikey Siegel it</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.179" end="00:25:02.900" style="s2">founded consciousness hacking you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.070" end="00:25:04.850" style="s2">really was asking what are the skillful</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.900" end="00:25:06.830" style="s2">means of the future or to say a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.850" end="00:25:09.710" style="s2">different way like how good can we get</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.830" end="00:25:13.669" style="s2">it really shifting human consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.710" end="00:25:16.450" style="s2">at a personalized level so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.669" end="00:25:18.140" style="s2">the first but I&#39;d say the second bit is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.450" end="00:25:20.690" style="s2">inevitably there are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.140" end="00:25:22.100" style="s2">unintended consequences of benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.690" end="00:25:24.950" style="s2">and nourishing technology for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.100" end="00:25:27.580" style="s2">people may become addicted to the high</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.950" end="00:25:30.620" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll need clinics to heal that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.580" end="00:25:31.299" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.620" end="00:25:33.950" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.299" end="00:25:36.440" style="s2">it&#39;s we have to do a very like serious</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.950" end="00:25:37.880" style="s2">cost-benefit analysis and say hey there</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.440" end="00:25:41.150" style="s2">are a lot of potentialities and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.880" end="00:25:44.650" style="s2">potential pitfalls and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.150" end="00:25:44.650" style="s2">and I spoke to this slightly earlier</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.059" end="00:25:53.210" style="s2">this hedonic treadmill that were on of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.260" end="00:25:57.590" style="s2">blessing out we if we build technology</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.210" end="00:25:59.539" style="s2">that way not a good thing if we build</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.590" end="00:26:01.549" style="s2">with our tools that basically indeed</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.539" end="00:26:06.049" style="s2">allow us to dependent our own experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.549" end="00:26:07.669" style="s2">which by necessity is behold the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.049" end="00:26:09.559" style="s2">plethora of human experience from</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.669" end="00:26:11.270" style="s2">negative to positive that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.559" end="00:26:14.330" style="s2">that&#39;s a different innovation altogether</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.270" end="00:26:15.770" style="s2">so these can be shortcuts if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:18.049" style="s2">designed in the wrong way there could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.770" end="00:26:18.820" style="s2">some sort of non Geo transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.049" end="00:26:21.820" style="s2">function button</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.820" end="00:26:24.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not what we&#39;re calling for here</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.820" end="00:26:27.399" style="s2">it&#39;s how you do we align our technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.100" end="00:26:30.009" style="s2">from a place of wisdom and in order to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.399" end="00:26:34.750" style="s2">enhance wisdom and wisdom is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.009" end="00:26:37.059" style="s2">hedonism I hope you&#39;re right you&#39;re</p>
