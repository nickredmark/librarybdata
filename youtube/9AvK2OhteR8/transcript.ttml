<p begin="00:00:00.410" end="00:00:07.230" style="s2">for today&#39;s video I want to talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.560" end="00:00:10.559" style="s2">thought experiment so imagine our world</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.230" end="00:00:13.559" style="s2">consists of two islands one island is</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.559" end="00:00:14.660" style="s2">based purely on competition survival of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.559" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">the fittest</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.660" end="00:00:23.189" style="s2">profit the highest God the other island</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:25.140" style="s2">is based on cooperation people get to</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.189" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">choose which island they live on and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.140" end="00:00:30.810" style="s2">they also can to change that choice at</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:33.530" style="s2">any time products can flow freely</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.810" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">between the the islands and so can ideas</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.530" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">in a world like that what ends up</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">happening what is the working conditions</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">on both islands look like what would</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">make people move from one island to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">another what products are better and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:53.309" style="s2">cheaper and faster depending on which</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:56.480" style="s2">spot there is another piece to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.309" end="00:00:59.129" style="s2">experiment I like to add is that these</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.480" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">islands shrink and grow with the number</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.129" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">of people that are on them so if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">choose to move to competition island you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:08.430" style="s2">get to take your footprint of a world</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">with you and so the island shrinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.430" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">grow as as the people choose to live</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">there I think sitting with this thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">experiment that the working conditions</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:22.830" style="s2">would become very similar that is you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:25.650" style="s2">could there would be no need for minimum</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">wage even on competition Island because</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.650" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">you would have to pay people enough to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:32.210" style="s2">entice them to not be in cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:36.119" style="s2">Islands cooperation Island mimics</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.210" end="00:01:37.799" style="s2">socialism one of the critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.119" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">socialism is this idea that we would all</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.799" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">starve to death under it and if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">the case well he just moved to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">competition Island now who cares about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">thought experiment except this thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">experiment it&#39;s very similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">we&#39;re actually creating with the global</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">cooperative we don&#39;t have two islands we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">have the Internet and we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">corporations when we start a global tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">cooperative and invite people we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">starting cooperation Islands the only</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">way we bring people in is if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">voluntary if it entices them if the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:08.910" style="s2">products and services we are creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:09.399" style="s2">are better cheaper faster than what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.910" end="00:02:13.269" style="s2">on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.399" end="00:02:15.459" style="s2">other side and we keep improving working</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.269" end="00:02:19.540" style="s2">conditions and improving what we offer</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.459" end="00:02:21.489" style="s2">to the point where it not only affects</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.540" end="00:02:23.170" style="s2">our members but it draws other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.489" end="00:02:25.239" style="s2">and it affects the competitive world as</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.170" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">well the competitive world can&#39;t pay the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.239" end="00:02:31.510" style="s2">weed they don&#39;t need a minimum wage once</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:34.510" style="s2">everyone&#39;s needs are met you can&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.510" end="00:02:35.489" style="s2">people slave labor wages and expect them</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.510" end="00:02:37.720" style="s2">to keep working</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.489" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">so I&#39;m sitting with this thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.720" end="00:02:44.590" style="s2">experiment over the next few days and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.900" end="00:02:46.150" style="s2">seeing what it is that we can create</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.590" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">together because I think this is also a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.150" end="00:02:50.829" style="s2">good analogy this and the puzzle one I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:53.379" style="s2">introduced a few days ago is a great</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.829" end="00:02:55.480" style="s2">analogy for the puzzle pieces what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.379" end="00:02:57.069" style="s2">it for the individual and this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.480" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">these two islands one on competition I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.069" end="00:03:00.489" style="s2">wanted cooperation and people being able</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:02.829" style="s2">to voluntarily choose which one they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.489" end="00:03:04.120" style="s2">associated with is what we are creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.829" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">this world with the global tech</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.120" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">cooperative please like and subscribe</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">see you on Monday</p>
