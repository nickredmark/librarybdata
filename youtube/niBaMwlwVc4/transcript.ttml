<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:30.080" style="s2">the hard problems of how we can give an</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">the scientific worldview how we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">wrestle with that problem in conjunction</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">with the problem that greg calls the</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">that is pervasive throughout psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">which is that psychology has no unified</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">descriptive metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">by which it talks about mind and or</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.120" style="s2">throughout this we will be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">some of the most important philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.120" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">cognitive scientific and neuroscientific</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve done three</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">um sessions so far um i took the lead on</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:09.040" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">in which i was trying to set up um the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:12.400" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">of what&#39;s typically called you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.400" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">problem of consciousness the hard</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">problem of consciousness sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">more traditionally called the mind body</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">problem um and trying to show</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:22.960" style="s2">how using the pivotal figure descartes</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2">to try and show</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.960" end="00:01:28.400" style="s2">how enmeshed this problem is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">in our worldview our scientific world</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.400" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">view how they&#39;re deeply interwoven and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">bound together</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:36.159" style="s2">and how much they&#39;re enmeshed with our</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:38.560" style="s2">our sense our normative sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.159" end="00:01:41.119" style="s2">realness and how that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.560" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">and how that normative sense is actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">unstable for us</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">in a way that intersects with uh the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">of the heart problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:52.240" style="s2">and we want to continue that history but</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.560" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to shift and greg is going</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.240" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">to take the lead and i&#39;ll be more of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">interlocutor commentator um and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">he&#39;s going to discuss how this</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">this world knot you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">unfolded and ramified</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">through the history of psychology so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">welcome greg and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">great thank you for taking us through</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">this please amen</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">amen thank you great to be here uh look</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">forward to this uh installment i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">set up what i want to share here very</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">well today</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">through the three previous installments</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">in particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">uh analyzing descartes struggles</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">uh with mind and matter okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">really sets up essentially the stage</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:37.760" style="s2">which i&#39;m going to then try to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.760" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">following it in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">discipline of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">okay and what my fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">point here is that there is that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">really want uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">i think anybody that cares about</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">philosophy science uh knowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">um should really understand is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">there is this thing called the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">okay um and that it&#39;s actually well</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">documented it&#39;s well understood</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">and in a nutshell here&#39;s the basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">problem and that is to this day</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a good language system</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">a consensually agreed upon way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">as professionals as experts as</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">scientists as philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">of the intersection of science</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">mind and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">okay we just we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">the shared</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">understanding of what those terms mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">reference in the world that&#39;s my basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">so greg would uh would it be fair to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:41.959" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">koon&#39;s notion here of psychology being</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.959" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">pre-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t have a unifying paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">science exactly so that&#39;s exactly so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">like to say that modern psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">uh is both pre and multi-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">okay and it&#39;s pre-paradigmatic in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">sense that it does not have</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">the classic consensual so we can use</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">newton&#39;s classic mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:09.439" style="s2">as the ultimate paradigm that lasts 200</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">years in physics where</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.439" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">the idea of what matter was what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">foundational laws were</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">the calculus that we&#39;re going to use to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">study it and the power of that paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">to dominantly allow</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">um consensual knowledge to be built with</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">a center</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">uh that for that has virtual um complete</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">agreement until</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">uh the anomalies of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">general relativity then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">overthrow that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a classic example of paradigm and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">what i&#39;m going to walk through</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">is really psychology has never had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">okay it is it very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">started to fragment um and then never</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">achieved any kind of dominance in</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2">relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">what actually it was okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting um i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">that i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">i remember uh talking to my friends</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">about this when i was in grad school</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">uh about this we read uh you know some</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">philosophy of science and [ __ ] at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">but i&#39;m interested you&#39;ve got a a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">subtle distinction</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">maybe you could unpack it just a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">bit you said psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">pre-paradigmatic and you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">explained that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">but i i don&#39;t want to steal your fender</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">for what you&#39;re going to say but in what</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">sense do you see</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">psychology as multi paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">right and that&#39;s that&#39;s a so now what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">will do in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">in the sense that of course there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">clusters of ideas we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">freud and psychoanalysis and uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">psychodynamic thinking we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">behaviorism starting with watson uh and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">so actually i&#39;ll use that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">to help understand the different</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">paradigms uh that at least people tried</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">to establish</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">to then compete for dominance over what</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">territory is okay great</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:57.280" style="s2">that&#39;s really good great one more</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">question and now i&#39;m going to putting on</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.280" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">my cock&#39;s i hat</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">here and so there&#39;s also uh i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:05.919" style="s2">what the difficulties of course without</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">a paradigm or especially when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.919" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">multi</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:11.280" style="s2">paradigmatic is a massive ontological</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">equivocation and confusion</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.280" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">which of course you&#39;ve highlighted in</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">some of your work um</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">and then i&#39;m also thinking uh as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">cognitive scientist</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">that there&#39;s even that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">is this the right adjective there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">even a broader uh possibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">qualification because there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">competing</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">sciences of mind with psychology there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">neuroscience there&#39;s artificial</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">i really believe okay so if we ask why</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">are we</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">why is the meaning crisis right now in</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">the 21st century particularly acute</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">okay and what is the way what are one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">the key patterns that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">need to wake up from it</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">it is solving the language game problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">on this issue</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">okay and wittgenstein you know i use</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">that from him and i i</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">you know he hated psychology in many</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:07:00.319" style="s2">ways because he saw it</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">as a convoluted mess rightfully so</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.319" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">paradigms inside the field</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have competing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">interacting elements associated with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">down into neuroscience okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:16.720" style="s2">up into philosophy of language issues</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.720" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">and indigenous psychological problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">okay meaning problems in terms of will</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">what is the frame that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">trying to place on so all what you get</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">what i realized i so so i i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">clear i love psychology okay i took</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">60 uh five credits as an undergrad i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">half of what i did</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">um and i was like oh my gosh you can do</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:42.240" style="s2">a science of mine you can measure stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">uh you can do experimentation um</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">and my journey on this is then i</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">actually got into the therapy world in</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">my graduate studies</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">okay uh and and i wasn&#39;t i wasn&#39;t aware</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">that there was a problem after 60</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">credits and relatively</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">you know reasonably thoughtful about</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">these issues it didn&#39;t really dawn on me</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">because what i thought psychology was</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">because this is what i was told</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">is that it&#39;s really it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">science that we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s really about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">and methodology that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">take that&#39;s actually what</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">modern psychology becomes okay is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">it&#39;s a frame</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">an epistemological methodological frame</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">called science</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to apply okay and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">then but when you actually become a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">therapist</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">all right and you start to say okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">gonna be a clinical psychologist now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">gonna have to work</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">uh and then i learn stuff from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">modern cool psychodynamic from freud to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">young</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">uh karen horneis one of my favorites you</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">know there are a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">interesting stuff there</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">and then i learned the becky and model</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">and ellis and which is the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">psychotherapy paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">and and then i i was always actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">most uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">arm wrestling with skinner although i</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">turn out that my model is about</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">if there&#39;s one person it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">parallel with it&#39;s actually ironically</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">about bf skinner of all peoples</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">interesting okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">so all of these individuals say really</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">and then i wanted to be coherent as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">therapist i want to be grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">science and say</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">but when you back up you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">they actually use these very different</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">languages have very different starting</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">points</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">make very different claims and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">get massive equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">when you try to achieve coherence right</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">this is a very helpful and clear setup</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">greg so</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">start taking us through the history then</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">please okay so</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">the history is right where we left off</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">with descartes</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">and the emergence of modern science okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">so you what you have is from we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">the galileo</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">into newton and the development of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">matter and motion</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">okay so just for clarity we are adopting</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">now a naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">frame for cause and effect okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">measuring stuff because we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">suspicious of the representational mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try to cancel that out so</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:03.519" style="s2">that we get independent</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">measurement of primary qualities and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.519" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">will be suspicious of the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">first person empirical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to try to grain</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">systematic methods of experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">measurement and the mathematical mapping</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">of matter in motion</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">okay so so let&#39;s just route just so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">can keep refreshing people&#39;s awareness</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">of this term</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">so we can use it greg invoked the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">distinction that&#39;s common to both</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">galileo</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">and descartes between primary and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">secondary qualities the primary ones are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">the mathematically measurable ones as</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">great just said and those secondary</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">right uh that exists only in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">in the representational mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">the the the term that is used for that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">sort of common parlance or qualia so</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">when i&#39;m talking when greg and i start</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">talking about qualia</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about all of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">properties all of those qualities</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">that are not held by the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">to be properties of objective things but</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">exist in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">vague look at my hands waving it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:05.519" style="s2">only in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">just just to remind people of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">okay and then so and then we get the uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">the empiricist philosophers most</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">famously</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">lock and hume okay really saying well</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">what is this what are we seeing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">out here</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">making this distinction refining it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.760" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">and and renee descartes coming along</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">with dualism</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">okay offering that split that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:30.079" style="s2">these there&#39;s the world of mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">there&#39;s the world of matter um we get</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.079" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">then we get uh kant with his</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">rational and empirical synthesis and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">really is the modern</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">the founder you know modern philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">really begins with kant</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">okay and he then offers his categories</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">of mind he brings the idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">mind is not just a blank slate but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">actually has what we would call perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">cognitive schema</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">yeah that afforded the categories of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">space and time and causality that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">built in</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">um and and he then has i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.560" style="s2">get into the technical aspects of the a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">priori synthetic whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">but there&#39;s basically okay the mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">the human mind is there to organize the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">nomina</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">the things in themselves but it has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">phenomenological experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">things in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">okay and that then hands</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">the modern enlightenment a basic model</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">of a subjective phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">that is in some categorical relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:28.720" style="s2">with the nominal things in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">right okay okay and and that basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">you know that how dualistic that is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">not really philosophical dualism but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">phenomena and nomina is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">issue right right okay so now what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">want to do okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">we&#39;ll sort of fast forward that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2">takes us into uh the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">all right where science by this time</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">newton&#39;s work is really now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">expanding into chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">um the the drive not the drive to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">for scientific mathematical uh analysis</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">of matter and motion various kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">energy matter changes</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">is really i mean this is the heyday</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">right i mean people are making</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">discoveries that great things are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">okay and then what you get then is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.360" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">the idea that well maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">scientifically correspond</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">changes in the physical environment to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">changes in</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">our phenomenological experience and to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">to yoke that together that would set the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">stage for</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">systematic and science of the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">qualia</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">right right right right so like people</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">like fechner and people like that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">bingo that&#39;s exactly where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">okay so now helmholtz and fechner set</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">the stage</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">uh and generate some of actually the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">most powerful and sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">findings okay the psychophysical laws of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">just noticeable difference</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:56.079" style="s2">okay absolute threshold and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">doing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.079" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">changing the relationship of a physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">stimulus in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">quantifiable primary quality way okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">and then they&#39;re having people report on</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">the changes in what it is that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">experience what just noticeable</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">differences they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">and what is the threshold of detection</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">and then what how do you make the change</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">physically and what pops up uh in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">person&#39;s field of first person</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">so let&#39;s just give a quick example of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">that i think that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">uh so one might be just notable&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">just noticeable difference</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.199" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">um so i have a sound which is a you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">wave frequency uh you know and i can</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">vary that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">and i&#39;m varying it physically right the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">frequency</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">and then i ask people when they notice a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">change in pitch</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">what i do is i figure out and then what</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">i do is uh i</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">i sort of measure out these changes in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">pitch</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">against you know the continuous</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">variation</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">uh frequency of the wave and then i</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">calculate some</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">correspondence ratio between them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">then i get a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">physical law i get the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">event of noticing the difference</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">matched into uh where on the physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">continuum</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">of change in frequency that gets marked</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">and i get these</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">physical laws exactly exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">and what i want to then hone in as sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">of like when we use the term physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">reference point for what the physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.079" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">okay the problem of psychology is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">competing paradigms are</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">not going to um agree on what we just</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">used as the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">psychological right there right right</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:38.560" style="s2">because what we mean by there is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">this distinction between the primary and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.560" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">secondary</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">and that is the grammar that emerges at</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">this juncture</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">okay so well i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">say so one of the fundamental problems</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">is that the way uh given what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">talked about the previous</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">classes uh sessions is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">the i mean the the very definition of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">of these two types so the primary are by</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">mathematically measurable and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">secondary ones are by definition</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">not mathematically measurable so how can</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">you possibly</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">measure them together exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">and and then we can start to think okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">so now what we see</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">is then this does establish the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">fundamental trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">for what becomes psychology okay all</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">right so wilhelm vunt</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">is the father of psychology in general</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">all right and he picks up</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">on the psychophysics okay and we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">the psychophysics of sensation and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">he&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">is he&#39;s going to transform this into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">introspection</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">on perception okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">so i&#39;ll say that so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">psychophysical</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">around sensation so i&#39;m going to jump</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">and then all you need to do is say oh i</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">feel that i notice the difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">okay now we&#39;re going to take it up a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:16:59.160" style="s2">layer</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to have a narrator an</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">introspectionist</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">report on what i see so if i hold up</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">this and you say well what do you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">i see a phone okay and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">going to be well actually is that what</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">you see is you see a phone or do you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">a shape that you then infer to be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">phone</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">okay so now we&#39;re going to have the now</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">what happens is well psychology</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">requires us to introspect and to share</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">this representational system that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">only have access to our own</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:34.799" style="s2">internal world right right and and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">also is bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:38.160" style="s2">the beginning of the problem of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">and intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.160" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">because seeing it a phone</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">is not an entity which within</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">the ontology of physics physics talks</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">about mass</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">and it talks about but this being a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">phone is not part</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">of that ontology properly okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">oh thank god you bring that up okay so</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">now what</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">what one of the things that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">here is where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">modern empirical natural science system</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.919" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">brings an epistemology we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">shift from your subjective perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">to as external focus on the primary qual</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">quantities really as possible okay and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have a classical</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">cause effect deterministic sequence that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">fundamental real ontology okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">of cause and effect and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">is sort of epiphenomenal potentially if</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">you&#39;re a hardcore reductive determinist</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:36.120" style="s2">mechanical materialist right right right</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s an ontological and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.120" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">language game that classical matter in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">motion mechanics offers</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to then take that and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">understand the mind jammed into that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">okay but there&#39;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">debate as to whether well are we taking</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">the epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">of of that system or the ontology of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">system yeah right right okay so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">is are we using</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">the methods of like newtonian science to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">understand the mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">and human exemplifies this that&#39;s how he</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">understands what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">or are we actually are we actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">landmark free</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">are we actually claiming that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">the mind is just another</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">material thing that it is the thing it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">is ultimately made out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">material stuff and exactly there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">of equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">between those two also yep going all</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">over the place okay so massive</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">so here we have and so what vant is vons</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">ontology is actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">psychophysical parallelism okay which</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">would be an actual early version of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">i would offer in some ways in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">it&#39;s he doesn&#39;t know how to connect the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">two but he argues that they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">connected they&#39;re all one substance at</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">one level but there is some</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">fundamental cause effect relation at</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">some level that he hasn&#39;t unable to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">specify so he wants to pull that out</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">okay uh but he&#39;s more interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">laboratory descriptive analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">professional introspectionists on their</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">inner experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">depending on the different environments</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.559" style="s2">and and external</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">independent variables that they try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.559" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">share okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s vant vund also makes a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">important point that he differentiates</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">the lab-based uh analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">inner experience versus what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">vulcar psychology which really sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">cultural folk psychology yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">that term is used in cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">right still so</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">okay yeah so basically for him he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">well people are reporting on their</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:33.440" style="s2">introspective experience all the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">they&#39;re generating narrative this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">it&#39;s going to drive art it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">drive convention</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">you can&#39;t experimentally analyze it but</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">if we understand the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">through introspection systematically</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">then we can understand the parts and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be part of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to bridge us into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">other social sciences so that&#39;s vent</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">okay and and he uh to really</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">label him in a particular way we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">follow especially in american psychology</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.559" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">will follow his student edward titchener</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">okay and he brings to cornell university</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">he brings structuralism</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">all right and this is a he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">authoritarian guy and he brings this</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">very strict</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">uh narrow view that psychology is only</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">human first-person experience and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">can only study it through his structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">and he developed and it is all about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">qualia he develops a list of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">like 44 000 different possible qualia</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">that he then you know creates a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">hierarchy of how they&#39;re organized okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">so so now psychology is the science for</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">this branch</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">of the structure of qualia right right</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">so did he i this is something i know</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">nothing of so this is a question out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">i mean around the same time uh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">and you&#39;re also going to get you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">what&#39;s going to become phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">in which people are trying to study a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">phenomenological experience but i take</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">it that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">i didn&#39;t i&#39;ve never heard of any</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">connection between</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">people like uh host role and kitchener</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">or or i i wouldn&#39;t i don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">titus was influenced or what he said</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">uh phenomenology exactly uh there&#39;s a i</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">think he predates it i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">yeah yeah well but there are what your</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">point about pragmatism and james</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">actually is nice i&#39;ll follow that line</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">okay because because that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what then this is the first real</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">divide</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">in understanding what we mean by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">mental the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">okay okay so as you know um</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">we get william james who is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">fathers of pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:41.919" style="s2">okay and a philosopher and the father of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">american psychology who writes in 1918</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.919" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">1890 principles of psychology okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">which is arguably in this time period as</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">far as i&#39;m concerned the best book</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">written</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">in psychology okay it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">heads and shoulders really above the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">rest in terms of what i think we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">okay but here&#39;s james he&#39;s a pragmatist</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">and a functionalist which is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">functionalist wants to look around</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">and ask how the heck do animals and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:12.159" style="s2">do what they do and in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">okay and what is it about them that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">enables them to behave</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">so radically differently than the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:21.120" style="s2">inanimate world the function</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">of their action okay which for james is</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.120" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">this will create a is mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">conscious mental life right right sorry</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">so james is uh influenced i know james</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">is somebody i study quite deeply</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">james is deeply influenced by darwin</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s where the so the notion</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">i just want to be clear here for people</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">the notion gains functionalism is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">the same thing as computational</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">functionalism</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">no for james functionalism basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">something that explains darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">exactly about that and then that also</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">introduces an important point here</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">that you know the darwini the darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">model um looks very</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">much like it fits into newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">worldview very well</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">uh you know it looks like you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">talking about you know mechanic purely</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">mechanical processes</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">et cetera et cetera but it does</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">introduce and this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">argument i make</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">it does introduce dynamical systems and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">complex system theory</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">it it insinuates it into the newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">um and people sensitive people thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">for people like james</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">were picking up on this right in which i</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">the physicists at the time were not</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">uh on that that&#39;s a great point okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">now let&#39;s back up</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">just a second because this is a this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">exactly what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">in terms of the meta what i call the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">descriptive metaphysical problem that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">get ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">okay so if we go back to galileo we</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">mentioned this earlier i</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">i you know offered you were commenting</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">that and i reiterated</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">so galileo hates metaphysics okay and he</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">and much of his identity is breaking</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">from aristotle across the entire</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">four causes of substance material</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">uh kinetic efficient okay and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">formal and final causation all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">and you matter in motion as the words</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">imply</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">require some sort of substance and some</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">sort of kinetic</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">but the rest of it is a shoot okay and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">believe that the material dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">complexity if you you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">language system of the trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">is the matter dimension</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">yeah actually um aristotle&#39;s application</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">of final and formal causation</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">to the behavior of atoms and rocks is</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">not as superfluous and confusing and not</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">very effective</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">but when you get into what plants</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">uh cells even animals and people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a radically</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">different set of behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">okay that are both a function of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">something very different</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">and they function really it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:03.279" style="s2">not see them as functioning</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">to do different things right you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">this function</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">of and then function two dynamic exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">and what what what i</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">what i want to do just to connect that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">is the notion of adaptivity exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">smuggles those two</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">in because you have to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">and what it functions to do it functions</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">to afford the organism</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">surviving long enough to successfully</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">reproduce so these these are</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">aristotelian and you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">alicia gerardo has noted this</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">darwin is basically smuggling in i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">think in any explicit fashion</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">but he&#39;s bringing in dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">he&#39;s bringing in deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">he but he&#39;s bringing in as gregor said</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">he&#39;s smuggling in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">uh these two missing aristotelian causes</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">absolutely and i believe that actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">when we get sophisticated about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">concept of information uh computational</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">process all of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">we are then going to see exactly what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">the functional information processing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">storage accumulation over the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">generations</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">how it gets played out in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">individual&#39;s life of course they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">have access to these concepts at this</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:10.640" style="s2">juncture</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">right um but genetics the computational</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">science revolution et cetera all of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">will then</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">uh awaken us to these other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">uh that are that are not available but</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">so james is a functionalist he&#39;s a he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">also gives rise to radical empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">by which he he wants to embrace hey what</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">do we see</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">what do we actually see in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">what is our functional</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:34.559" style="s2">useful explanations for how it actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">works and the real mystery for</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.559" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">him is is really what i would call sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">of a mental life</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:41.679" style="s2">behavioral view and what he means by</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">that is he&#39;s watching the actions and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.679" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">adaptations</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">of animals across their life and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">understanding the darwinian history of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">and says that&#39;s the dynamic functional</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">mental life psychology should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">explaining how the hell that happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what our task is</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">and to sit in a lab and nitpick</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">structural differences between qualia</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">is not where the problem&#39;s at right</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">right right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">well said very well okay so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">the two problems that are the subtitle</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:13.760" style="s2">of our our</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">work together are really coming together</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.760" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">in james right there</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.120" style="s2">and the tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">functionalists and the structuralists</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.120" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">right and we get then this break so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">ha and this is a very strong break the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">structuralist especially by the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">titchener comes along</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">he&#39;s like this is what you do and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">either submit to me or you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">doing something different and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">own psychology okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">and james of course has already been</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">influenced and so they</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">they are not uh agreeing okay on what it</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:43.760" style="s2">is that they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">right and then in the uh right at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.760" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">the 20th century it&#39;s about the time so</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">james is published 1890. i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">remember exactly when titurnary gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">installed in cornell but</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">you know 1905 1910s that&#39;s the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">well then another thing happens actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">two things that will happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">simultaneously to give us</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">the split across all these domains and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">we will then have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">by 1920s we will have the ossified</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">problem of psychology which the great</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">theorist russian theorist lev vygotsky</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">calls the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re heading towards the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.679" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">right let&#39;s keep going so and then we</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">have two major figures that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">in american psychology then set the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">stage for the dominant paradigms that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">are operative in american</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">we get watson watson comes along</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">and and is wants to be is working with</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">animals and his experimentalist</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">okay so he&#39;s in the lab he wants a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">framework for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.960" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">the methodology of experimentism he</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">wants the epistemology of natural</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">and he is a hardcore mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">okay so he has the entire he wants to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:52.840" style="s2">then bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">the physical science methods of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">experimentation epistemology of external</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">and the idea that basically everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">is matter in motion</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">and for him a complex of neuromechanical</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">reflexes</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s deeply influenced by both</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">pavlov and thorndike right the oil</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">uh he is right particularly pavlov</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">why because at the time in particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">now skitter will advance on this</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">at the time the pavlovian reflexology</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">that pavlov was developing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">okay for those who don&#39;t pavlov is</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">actually a digestive and physiological</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">person but in russia the categories are</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">a little different</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">he&#39;s tech he&#39;s testing how meat powder</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">attacks</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">uh results in salivation and dogs most</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">commonly</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">he develops this unbelievably powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">paradigm which is with us today</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">classical conditioning although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">it&#39;s been updated so we know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">more functionally what it&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:48.799" style="s2">in relationship to learning but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">pairing of a bell</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.799" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">classically with meat powder boom and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">then the bell gives rise to salivation</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">okay and now you can test this and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">is conforms</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">to the language game of natural</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">experimental science</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">we have independent variables there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">mechanistic process we have dependent</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">variables</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">we can now begin the serious process</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">of real psychology because we know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">everything is just</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">physical anyway and so we&#39;re just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">just a complicated matrix of physical</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">switches and now we have a methodology</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:22.880" style="s2">according to the classic behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">system of a stimulus response and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.880" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">very explicit get rid of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">okay it doesn&#39;t work in the language</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">game but what we can study is now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">an introduces</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">officially behavior mind as</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">behavior you don&#39;t need the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:37.279" style="s2">mind what you do need is the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.279" end="00:31:40.480" style="s2">so everything now in psychology is in</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">observable measurables can measure the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">physical properties of the stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">and then i can measure the physical</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">response of the organism</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s all i&#39;ll need in order to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">explain behavior of course is</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">he&#39;s the father of behaviorism exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">so and then that becomes a very very</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">powerful mind notice it because it lines</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">up with the epistemology ontology</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">and methods of physics okay so</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">that&#39;s and then uh what&#39;s happening in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">very parallel time in vienna</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">uh a guy by the name of sigmund freud</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">okay he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">at the time working as a neurologist</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">okay early on</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">uh and studying crabs and other</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">crustaceans and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">finds hey this nervous system thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:27.840" style="s2">all about</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">activation and inhibition okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.840" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">everything is activation and inhibition</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">and of course the steam engine has been</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">enormously influential in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">so is this nervous system thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">uh a energy release kind of mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">right right so and and then he shows how</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">hey experiences can be shown he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">actually as early models of long-term</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">potentiation are found in his work and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">he starts initially</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">a project for scientific psychology</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">which he never publishes</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">okay um but for him then now we have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">idea that out of the nervous system is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">going to be energies</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">all right but then he hooks up um</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">with a number of people but basically to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">what he start he needs to make a living</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">and he hooks up into a physician</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">and starts to look at how people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">getting hypnotized</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">okay um and what he what notices</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:25.519" style="s2">at the time is an appreciation that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">some people will have a complete change</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">in their physical symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:31.039" style="s2">uh when they&#39;re hypnotized and most</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">commonly or classically what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.039" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">glove amnesia and there&#39;s a syndrome of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">so somebody would not have any feeling</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">in their hand okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">they could prick it they could look away</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">blah blah and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">freud knew enough and they knew enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">about neuro anatomy</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">at the time to know that actually that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense from a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">neuro-anatomy perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:51.679" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">you&#39;ll feel this if your hand goes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.679" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">sleep sometimes these two fingers are</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">tied to one nerve</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">and these the rest of your hands tied to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">another the idea that you would have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">a line right there that would lead to</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:03.760" style="s2">numbness is really odd</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">okay and then somebody would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.760" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">hypnotized and all of a sudden they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">have some cathartic moment</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">and this is right about the time and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">freud&#39;s getting these kinds of terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">and then they&#39;d release and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">sudden ah the hand feels</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">again so freud sees a couple of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">instances</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:23.599" style="s2">and and then transforms his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">energy impulse that the nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.599" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">in general</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">is that&#39;s underneath okay the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">rationales that we are giving okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">and and what&#39;s actually happening with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">lot of chaos confusion</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">is that there&#39;s this massive</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:39.520" style="s2">misdirection of consciousness for reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">giving</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.520" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">relative to these animalistic urges and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">impulses</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">and they start leaking out through the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">filter of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:51.599" style="s2">and he does interpretation of dreams and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">then in 1899 right before the turn of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.599" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">the century</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">he then does um psychopathology in</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">everyday life in 1904</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">okay he then gets invited in the clark</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">lectures in 1909 i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">i think he comes with young at that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">stage and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">introduces by this time he has this</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">analysis that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">hey folks conscious reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">self-conscious awareness that&#39;s the tip</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">of the iceberg okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">huge amounts of suffering confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">the ultimate drivers of human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">are these animalistic biological drives</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">that we are unaware of okay and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">drive a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">and so he so now what is he concerned</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.560" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">with the dynamic unconscious that which</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">behind consciousness okay very which</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:40.400" style="s2">then puts him at odds a bit with james</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t have a real good model for</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.400" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">the distinction between uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">sub or non-conscious process versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">consciousness okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">he&#39;s aligned with watson in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s a hydraulic model but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">unbelievably mentalistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">okay and freud does drop his strong</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">mechanistic reductionism it gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">to psychic determinism</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">in the sense that there is a psychic</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">energy his ontology of it isn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:05.920" style="s2">but fundamentally what we then have is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">so now we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">let&#39;s just review we have the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">scientifically analyze</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">the mind okay which is then</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">sort of defined originally in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">the dominant idea of the day that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:22.480" style="s2">these secondary experiences relative to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">primary events psychophysics starts down</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">that road</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">you get then the emergence of um</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">uh vunt and then the structuralist line</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">off of titchener</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s one meaning of psyche all</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">then we have the adaptive mental life</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">functional meaning from james</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">all right then we have no that really</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">psyche to the extent that means anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">animals do that we can experimentally</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">analyze</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">all right then finally it&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">an underlying mental</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">psychic entity that we&#39;re not fully</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">conscious of we have a conscious filter</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">it leaks out there&#39;s a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">unconscious and this we need to study it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">and what freud also offers that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">other three don&#39;t is he offers</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">uh a comparatively effective form of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">exactly so you so you get this he wants</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">psychoanalysis to be a science of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">a treatment for neurosis and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">a world</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">view that understands civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">humans discontent</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">and of course he&#39;s of all the people in</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">terms of the impact freud is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">you know head and shoulders above in</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">terms of because he spills over to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">humanities and he just</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">um he&#39;s such an unbelievable gigantic</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">whatever you think of him his influences</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">um surpassed only by you know einstein</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">and a few other people and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the issues at least but</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">but that success</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">is actually the opposite of what becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">form of criticism of freud which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">freud&#39;s model doesn&#39;t fit in to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t you can&#39;t study it with</p>

<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s the popularity and</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">i find that you know his ideas are so</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">complex and actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">we know that a lot of them are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">precisely because we can systematically</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">analyze them so</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:10.720" style="s2">i find poppers critique a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">simplistic in some ways but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">i mean uh yeah um but you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">right the question of</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">what freud&#39;s ideas are and whether they</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">are scientific or not</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">he said is a you know one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">and i certainly he way overshoots and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">comes up with a number of crazy things</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">that can&#39;t be falsified so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">definitely aspects of his ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">very difficult to falsify</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">and they basically become sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">objects of faith um</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">that the psychoanalytic faithful uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:42.079" style="s2">pledge allegiance to</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">that&#39;s well said but it&#39;s well said um</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.079" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">and then that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be a problem that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">ramble through</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">um all the i mean let&#39;s maybe we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">pause here and say</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">what are what are the problems that each</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">one have so the problem with freud is</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">uh and the whole psychodynamics it also</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">applies to young is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">well what&#39;s like what&#39;s the epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.359" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">here and how does this fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:04.240" style="s2">scientific world view</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:05.520" style="s2">is this even a science at all is this a</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.240" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">science of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.520" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">even though it&#39;s very clinically</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">right and then the problem facing watson</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">of course which is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">endemic problem of behaviorism</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">right and this is going to derive what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">called the cognitive revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">and you can hear you can hear james over</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">here it&#39;s because organisms</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:26.960" style="s2">and this is what actually comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">the more sophisticated study of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">pavlovian and upward condition</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">these organisms ultimately don&#39;t respond</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">to the physical property of the stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">they respond to the meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">stimulus so</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">just to give a very common example</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">an organism can see the light colored</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">light of a fire</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">it can smell the smoke right and those</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">are two very different physical things</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">but it responds in exactly the same way</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">because they mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">the same adaptive thing to the organism</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">and so it&#39;s going to be one of the so</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">the meaning is missing</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">uh from behaviorism the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">structuralism and titchener and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">introspectionism is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">right for all of his and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">completely right for all of his</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">authoritarian taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">you just don&#39;t get the invariant</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">agreement you want introspection just</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">is too um it&#39;s well it&#39;s too beset</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">by all of the bakeries of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">human consciousness and working memory</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">and self-deception and bias</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">and then the problem with with for for</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">james</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">right and i think of all of all of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">james saw his own problems maybe better</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">than others</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">absolutely i think james realized that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:43.359" style="s2">trying to incorporate these darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">ideas into the study of mind was</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.359" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">problematic given the standard cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why he becomes so enamored</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">um with pierce first right yep</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">pragmatism because pragmatism is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.000" style="s2">attempt</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">to create uh an alternative epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">an alternative to cartesian mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:07.200" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.079" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">exactly the degree to which that project</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.200" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">uh has succeeded of course is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s how why that&#39;s why it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">uh it&#39;s still an issue</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">uh dan chappie and i are reading uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">bacon&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">on pragmatism which is traces this here</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">this history of</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">um ongoing like when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">get to figures like quine and davidson</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:32.720" style="s2">and sellers already</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">the ongoing you know dialogue and debate</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.720" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">between pragmatism and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">scientism which is a cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">interpretation of how you do science</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">um and that&#39;s that&#39;s that so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">problem is ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">so quick review so not only are we</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">getting fragmentation it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">each one of these four is in some</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">important sense lacking definitely</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">lacking inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">definitely lacking and so and somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">from just a basic</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">we can we should be able in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">we should be able to step back</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">things will get a little complicated</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">with the cognitive revolution but we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">basically sit back and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">so you have some people saying uh mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">is just behavior</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">okay all right and then you have someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">mind is phenomenology right right okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">uh you have that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">and then you have sort of some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">functional cognitive mental life with</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">james</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">right right right and then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">a self-conscious portion of mind and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">sober unconscious portion and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">dynamic relation between them</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">in freud yeah and freud okay these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.000" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">the referent points</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:43.520" style="s2">okay and i think we should be able a a</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">unified frame of psychology we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">put the ontological reference in each of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">those that there is a way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:51.599" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">and behavior is connected okay there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.599" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">a way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:56.640" style="s2">phenomenology there is a way to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">about the hierarchy of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.640" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">a self-conscious into subconscious kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">of dimension</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">okay and we&#39;re going to want a an</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">adequate unified frame of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">will conceptually juxtapose these</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">ontological reference into a consilient</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">picture right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">that of course and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">something we&#39;re going to work towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re working towards that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">right now what we should all in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">problem formulation we&#39;re still in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">problem for emulation stage the history</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">and once again what what somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">observing this conversation observing</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">this history is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no adequate language game</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">there&#39;s just no adequate language game</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no adequate one but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.680" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">four that are competing with you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">absolutely right there&#39;s no adequate</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">super ordinate one</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">they&#39;re reasonable if you enter into it</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">and you say hey i&#39;m gonna start playing</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">this game</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">they obviously live because they have</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">slices of information</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">that have reasonable things to say that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">you can start gaining cumulative</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">knowledge around</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">absolutely you know but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:04.720" style="s2">they are totally the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">the rules and grammar by which they play</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.720" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">force definitions and are limited when</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">you flip outside of them and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">compete and they say oh so watson&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">obvious about this he just has to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.319" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">you can&#39;t talk about consciousness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">pointless it&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">the modern empirical natural science</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:21.119" style="s2">language game period</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">so there it is so you&#39;re you violate the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">rules as soon as you bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">the term in right so let&#39;s let&#39;s gather</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">this all together because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">really important so we get a host</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">of what let&#39;s call them epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">and metaphysical problems</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">from descartes and the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">revolution which we&#39;ve already explored</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">and then what happens is you get the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:43.920" style="s2">birth of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">a science or at least the proto-science</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.920" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">posted in some sense solve this address</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">right somehow situate mind back in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">project but when it tries to do this</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">right not only does it not</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">adequately address the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">problems given to us</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:02.720" style="s2">uh like the epistemological and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">metaphysical problems given to us by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">by descartes in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">revolution it it now introduces this</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:09.920" style="s2">additional problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">which we may call it i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">to call it we could call it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:14.240" style="s2">um like a disciplinary problem in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.240" end="00:45:17.760" style="s2">what we have or a paradigmatic problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">i want to distinguish it from the pure</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">sort of epistemological and metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">yeah no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a multiple it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">of like uh i&#39;ll use uh peter lindberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">notion of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">culture war 2.0 it&#39;s the explosion</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">of multi-polarity okay and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">trying to compete then for paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">attention and dominance and resource</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">where they then have to deploy uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">critiques of others and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">and it is a very much a hey what side</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">are you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">on what group are you going to be so</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">both equivocation defense it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.440" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">they&#39;re not engaged india logos here</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">to get to the answer they are generally</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">engaged in staking out territory and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">trying to get attention and resources</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">which of course that adds enormous</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">amount</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">of chaos and uncertainty in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">to what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">you know we are talking about right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:10.079" style="s2">when you so</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">when you turn let&#39;s say you want to try</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.079" end="00:46:12.640" style="s2">and address the problems that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">has between</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.640" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">us and then you say what i do is i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">turn to science and gather data and good</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">in order to try and come up with a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">of solving these cartesian problems</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">instead what you get is this fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">mess</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">right that that actually right</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">is thwarting your ability to give an</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">adequate</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">even an adequate problem formulation of</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">what descartes</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">has left us right i i talked to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">again sort of more on the science side</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">of this equation but coming from complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">that actually is jim rutt</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">i was talking to him the other day he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">like well i looked into psychology and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t make heads or tails of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:52.319" style="s2">so that on the and i&#39;ve talked to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:53.119" style="s2">number of philosophers sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.319" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">same way it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.119" end="00:46:56.160" style="s2">you enter into it you enter into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">swamp of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">of all of this kind of possible angles</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">data sets language games etc okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">and and so by 1927 lev vygotsky</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">you know who tragically dies early but</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">he&#39;s a brilliant psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.160" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">he&#39;s second only to piaget in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">developmental psychology</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:24.559" style="s2">oh absolutely yeah like vygotsky is is</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">is an unrecognized titan right right</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.559" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">um one of my next door uh right next to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:30.720" style="s2">me and we hired her</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">is elaine of a savina she is a russian</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.720" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">psychologist educational psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">got both</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">her doctorate in russian psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">doctorate in american school psychology</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">um we have thankfully an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">vygotsky in theory right next door so</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:46.480" style="s2">but so yeah and actually um we could do</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">a whole nother issue about what happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">in russia</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">and what gives rise to what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">russian activity theory okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">which actually is similar to foreign</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">a contextual adaptive behavior dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">system that&#39;s really fascinating with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">layered</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">cultural uh tool language tool structure</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">that develops in context it&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">but american psychology that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">happens in american psychology</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">it&#39;s actually anglo-american psychology</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">by this point too isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">yeah yes absolutely uh and so that&#39;s a i</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">want to be clear that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">i&#39;m trailing but the problem is super</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">interesting even when we circle</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">uh the particular cultural context for</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">it okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">so we have to remember england and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">america are going to be the next two</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">superpowers</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">that&#39;s right they dominate the world in</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">a very important way</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">that&#39;s right and and they and they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">this very strong empiricist bent</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.960" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">okay um that actually has all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">but at the same time empiricism in and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">of itself if you don&#39;t have the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">and categories can&#39;t get you</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">out you have to have logic or</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">metaphysical clarity descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">metaphysical clarity</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">um to actually gain cumulative knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">i interrupted you you&#39;re going to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:57.119" style="s2">what luria said sorry what the glotsky</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">right so vygotsky the point i want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">make is that vygotsky has identified</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">exactly what i&#39;m telling you i was going</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">to say that actually he says you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">if you pay attention actually it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">even the theorists that are really</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">articulating what the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">it&#39;s practitioners it&#39;s psychiatrists by</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">the mid 1920s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">psychology is there&#39;s no general frame</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">is it freud</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">is it watson uh there was an emergence</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">of personalism</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">uh the personalist approach by wilhelm</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">stern at the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:28.240" style="s2">and that actually builds off of you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">sort of combines a few</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">and and and he&#39;s in gestalt psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">but they actually all line to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:36.079" style="s2">uh domains that i&#39;ve identified up to</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.079" end="00:49:40.000" style="s2">okay logical and functional right</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">exactly and and so now</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.000" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">boom you get this real crisis all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">and russian activity theory offers i</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">think actually uh um</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:49.599" style="s2">not the exact same solution that i do</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:51.280" style="s2">but an interesting one but inside</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.599" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">american empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.280" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">the the system simply grows okay so</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">in terms of its confusion right so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:49:59.520" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:01.359" style="s2">here&#39;s a couple of other pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.520" end="00:50:03.520" style="s2">then emerge then in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">uh in england and in particular united</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">states so out of watson</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">you get skinner yes okay skinner is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">a classic behaviorist</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">okay he&#39;s a radical behaviorist</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">and has his whole philosophy of what</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">behaviorism is and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">for him what everything we call mind is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">right okay for skinner so he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">you&#39;re always in the presence of one</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">behaving person</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">if you have a toothache that is part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">that is your manifestation of private</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">okay so the complete uh transition of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">the language of what</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">normally would be called mind is called</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">behavior the goal of science is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:44.960" style="s2">prediction and control of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">and skinner gives rise to um a branch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:49.119" style="s2">okay which i think is absolutely crucial</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">to understand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">wrong in some ways it&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">it&#39;s defined against the information</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">processing view</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.319" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">of the cognitive revolution okay which</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to in a sec</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">um but it is absolutely crucial that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">better have a framework for mind as</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">behavior okay in my opinion and gilbert</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">ryall as a philosophical i was just</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">going to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">he&#39;s going to be like i think makes the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">very important point that our categories</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">about what we think about his mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">much of it is behavior and what what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">unified theory ultimately lends me to</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">is that actually we need to instantiate</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">mental behavior okay mental behavior</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">turns to be a very very complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">important bridging concept between our</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">fractured systems that can then be</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">organized</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:41.119" style="s2">okay so we get skinner and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">important for our own confusion because</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.119" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">a number about five to ten percent of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">psychologists to this day think about</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">psychology as the science of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">not a behavior and mental process okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">so and and it gives rise to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2">powerful but also very isolating</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">radical behavioral view that&#39;s it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">diametrically</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">opposed to a number of other paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:02.800" style="s2">so it is a radical</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.800" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">paradigmatic view and and hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.800" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">behaviors you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">people outside of their culture will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">like god you can&#39;t talk to those people</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">yeah but so let&#39;s let&#39;s i mean so while</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">uh is important because he so um</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:18.400" style="s2">within cockside i was taught to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">distinguish between skinner&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.400" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">methodological behaviorism and rile&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">logical behaviorism</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">um but they&#39;re they&#39;re allies uh and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:30.079" style="s2">uh rao famously argued that all mental</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:33.119" style="s2">terms can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.079" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">are logically analyzable into basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">multi-track dispositional terms</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">right classic example is belief um we</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.160" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">think because it&#39;s a verb that we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">be looking for some</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">mental event and while says no all</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is expressing a conditional</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">behavior um to say i believe the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">training is to say if i see</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">the windows open i will close it right</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">or if i go outside i&#39;ll take an umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">etc and then what what skinner&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">with the methodological behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">what&#39;s giving that what&#39;s what&#39;s keeping</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">behaviorism</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:08.160" style="s2">going in my opinion is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">what did david get back and say at one</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.160" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">point a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">hours of experimentation the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">behaviorists really</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">really develop experimental methodology</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">to a very significant degree they</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">definitely do</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">right and and i and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">skinner&#39;s concept of behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.359" style="s2">selection okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">is really very powerful when you when</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.359" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">you understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">the tren the evolution from the classic</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">stimulus response pairing</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:37.599" style="s2">into a feedback loop okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">of behavioral what i would call</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.599" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">behavioral investments</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:42.079" style="s2">that have differential consequences that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.880" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">then select</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.079" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">pathways of investment yeah and i just</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">want to highlight that because</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">and other people have noted this that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">this is something that people within 40</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">cogs i have noted</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s uh that&#39;s skinner slipping</p>

<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">oh uh yeah and actually he right he he</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.880" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">wasn&#39;t and skinner if you read him i</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">mean he didn&#39;t slip it in he&#39;s like i</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">want to be the darwin</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">of opera in theory that&#39;s what he said</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">you&#39;re right for correcting me greg</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">i didn&#39;t i i gave uh i my connotation</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">was incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">uh what i meant is um skinner</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">in fact often explicitly refers to</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">darwin</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">right if you leave textbooks on skinner</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">right right right absolutely so and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">skinner some skinner wants to understand</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">us in this conversation okay as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:36.880" style="s2">functional response across</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">three different tiers of selection okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.880" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">natural selection operand selection and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">verbal selection</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">right okay that&#39;s his model which by the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">way is going to translate immediately</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:50.720" style="s2">well natural selection gives rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:52.400" style="s2">complex dynamic interplay of life</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.720" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">behavioral selection gives us to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.400" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">complex dynamic interplay of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">animal behavior which i call mine and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">verbal selection justification of rules</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">grammars constituencies</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">give rise to so he then has this very</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">conte</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">he&#39;s a contextualist not a mechanist</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">okay that is fundamental if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">familiar with steven piffer&#39;s uh world</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">views okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">in 1942 argued these different</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:17.839" style="s2">fundamental so uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">uh watson is a mechanist through and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.839" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">through skinner&#39;s a contextualist okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:23.119" style="s2">he&#39;s always putting things in context</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">it&#39;s really really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">um but anyway so yeah so now what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">get but</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">but the the horror of this okay is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">because he</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">then insists with this behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">we&#39;re not integrating sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:40.400" style="s2">operand theory or at least we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:42.640" style="s2">vulnerable to breaking off sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.400" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">operant theory from the cognitive models</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.640" end="00:55:46.480" style="s2">yes okay and it&#39;s the 4e people that</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">have we got to come back</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.480" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">decades later right to reintegrate and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">embodied enacted think of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">the terms embodied the enacted the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">extended</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">all right this is this is the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">system in dynamic relation</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">with the environmental contingencies</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">okay but it gets split off</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">uh and and it and it and it forces a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:09.280" style="s2">particular kind of language</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing skinner is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.280" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">unbelievably hostile to mentalism</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:17.119" style="s2">he&#39;s very um so that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna that&#39;s gonna be to some</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.119" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">his achilles heel because precisely</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">because he reaches up to the level</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">of verbal selection he&#39;s gonna slam into</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">right and this is gonna be this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">be the devastating</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:31.920" style="s2">the devastating defeat of his career in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">so many ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.920" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">he&#39;s been allowed and rightfully so so</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">here&#39;s according</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">in the sense that so you have then uh so</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:40.720" style="s2">then the humanists happened by the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">and i&#39;m not going to get into them but</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.720" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">we have obviously</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">uh maslow and uh and which become</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">unbelievably crucial for the identity of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">rightfully so but also when we get into</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">the profession</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">okay and what we are and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">trying to help people with and whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">these other models are really</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">deterministic and nasty</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.319" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">so this third force um is crucial for</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">human potential it&#39;s crucial for</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">how to like actually have people be</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">helpful in context</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:07.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very important thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">science of before you turn from it greg</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.599" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">i just want to put a little flag in</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:11.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:14.720" style="s2">uh that maslow is also bringing back</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.839" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">aristotle in a very powerful yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.720" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">if needs is barrier absolutely it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">very scale of nature kinds of stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:22.559" style="s2">uh so um and so maybe when we come back</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.559" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">and certainly i consider the meta</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">psychology i built a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">humanistic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.839" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">okay so and i&#39;m as a and as a absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:33.359" style="s2">crucial</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">to understand the application and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">professional development of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">and there are a lot of really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">ideas uh that rogers has</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">about the science of argue of human</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:44.319" style="s2">beings definitely</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">um i was just a little conscious of time</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">and i want to sort of make sure we wrap</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">this up in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">uh get to the revolution yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:54.960" style="s2">so and you and i know this very well so</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:57.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll just sort of summarize so</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.960" end="00:57:58.799" style="s2">then uh you go back to babbage babbage</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.440" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">builds a difference engine</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.799" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">okay and we get a the emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:03.760" style="s2">idea of a thinking machine we alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">some of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">all right and then it&#39;s in the 1920s</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">into 1930s and then explodes in the 40s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">and 50s</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">okay that the world of information</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.280" end="00:58:20.880" style="s2">science and theory and mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:22.400" style="s2">pop okay they explode okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.880" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">basically exactly you get the turing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">revolution where you get shannon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:29.119" style="s2">emphasis on information as reduction</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">uncertainty give rise to information</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.119" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">theoretic approaches</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:33.839" style="s2">okay which has become unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">influential basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.839" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">um for those that are not aware his i</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">his notions about certainty chaos order</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">disorder</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:42.720" style="s2">basically overlap completely it turns</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">out with thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.720" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:47.599" style="s2">reality there and we&#39;ll come back by the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">way in the unified system</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.599" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">uh to be a very important thing because</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">entropy and energy and the free energy</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:55.359" style="s2">accumulation inside and out turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">be a very very</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.359" end="00:59:01.520" style="s2">key element okay um so what we get</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:02.799" style="s2">is i mean so what greg is doing and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.520" end="00:59:03.520" style="s2">he&#39;s introducing something that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.799" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.520" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">sort of uh the progenitor of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:08.559" style="s2">science right you&#39;ve got it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">getting the beginning and turing</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.559" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">proposes it right the imitation game etc</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">the possibility of a new way of studying</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">but study mind by making minds and i</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.720" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">let&#39;s build artificial intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">we will we will go around all of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">chaos in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">and what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll build it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">because we built it we know how it works</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">and then and what and then and we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">also we can we</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.599" style="s2">can start talking uh we have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">talking about the mental</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.599" end="00:59:38.799" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t seem sort of spooky and</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">weird the way watson and skinner don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.799" end="00:59:41.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:42.960" style="s2">because we could what&#39;s gonna this is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.359" end="00:59:44.559" style="s2">bit anachronistic</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.960" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">going backwards but we&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.559" end="00:59:47.200" style="s2">talk about the hardware versus the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">software</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.200" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">of these information processing machines</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:52.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">the hardware is where the mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.319" end="00:59:57.200" style="s2">language goes and the software is where</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">the mental languages go and then wow</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.200" end="01:00:01.520" style="s2">this will be this</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:01.839" style="s2">and then of course that&#39;s going on as</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.520" end="01:00:04.640" style="s2">greg</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.839" end="01:00:05.359" style="s2">said and then chomsky is over here</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.640" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:09.280" style="s2">showing that skinner can&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:12.799" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.280" end="01:00:15.200" style="s2">at all and then what seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.799" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">coming to into the fore with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.200" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">computational revolution is the idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">of computer languages programs and</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:23.920" style="s2">computer languages</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:25.520" style="s2">and that that is the way in which we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.920" end="01:00:27.680" style="s2">be able to explain language</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.520" end="01:00:29.520" style="s2">and cognition and it looks like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:32.079" style="s2">promise of a great</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.520" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">uh reunification that&#39;s outside of all</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.079" end="01:00:36.720" style="s2">of this chaos</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">that greg has um has</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.720" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">uh indicated so it&#39;s a 100 and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">and that and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.839" end="01:00:43.920" style="s2">psychology does get organized that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.920" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">what happens in some ways okay but uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:49.359" style="s2">but so</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">so we get this but there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.359" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">equivocation and</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:55.520" style="s2">totally inside the system but yes so</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">crucially folks okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">information information theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">information semantic and information</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:01.839" style="s2">processing i make a distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:05.119" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.839" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">three layers of this but they but but</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.119" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">they&#39;re equivocating at this juncture</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">but now what we do have</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">is we have an idea that&#39;s consistent in</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:15.839" style="s2">with the natural science it is very</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">consistent in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.839" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">although i would argue the cause effect</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">of information</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:22.799" style="s2">processing information theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">especially that&#39;s then directed</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.799" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">through a semantic system towards</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2">something this is where you get this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:29.920" style="s2">descriptively these are different kinds</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">of cause effect behavior yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.920" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">they are and i i would supplement that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">by saying</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:37.200" style="s2">that what&#39;s called good old-fashioned ai</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.760" end="01:01:39.680" style="s2">the computational approach</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.200" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">is and this is it leaves out what you</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.680" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">were just flagging what was good in</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:44.400" style="s2">skinner that whole dynamical system</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">selection model</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.400" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">that the computational system the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">computational approach</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">really misses all of that selectivity</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:54.079" style="s2">that dynamical coupling</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">right they they jumped on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.079" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">algorithmic processing so fast</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:01:59.119" style="s2">and then the building of it so fast that</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:01.039" style="s2">they acted as though they could just</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.119" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">extract it completely it was so powerful</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.039" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">at one level there&#39;s so much excitement</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:06.960" style="s2">they left the body they left evolution</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">they left actual phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.960" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">you know participatory knowing and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:12.799" style="s2">actual embodiment of procedures they</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:14.480" style="s2">left all that crap behind</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.799" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">and acted they could just you know well</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:17.839" style="s2">big you know deep blue beats people at</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:18.400" style="s2">chess so that must be the whole damn</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.839" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.400" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly exactly right okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.000" end="01:02:25.440" style="s2">so well i was just going to say so the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.440" end="01:02:33.039" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">um i&#39;m just going to speak as a clock</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.039" end="01:02:36.799" style="s2">side and i&#39;ll give the mic back to you</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">like cockside promises to try and deal</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.799" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">with these problems</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:45.359" style="s2">but but that it hasn&#39;t yet produced</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:47.760" style="s2">a solution to the mess of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.359" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">the science of the mind is that fair to</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">say 100</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">uh and in fact we still we it helps okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:54.559" style="s2">so the cognitive piece is absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.559" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">all right we need to understand that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">nervous system is there for a reason</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:03:01.440" style="s2">it&#39;s taking up energy</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:03.680" style="s2">and fundamentally just like your gut</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.440" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">digests food to distribute energy the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.680" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">nervous system digests information</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:09.520" style="s2">right right it digests information and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:12.079" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.520" end="01:03:13.440" style="s2">that before okay so the cognitive really</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.079" end="01:03:14.960" style="s2">so now like searle to</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.440" end="01:03:17.119" style="s2">making a reference here to cyril is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:19.760" style="s2">biological emphasize sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.119" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">yeah it digests information it processes</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.760" end="01:03:24.319" style="s2">information it metabolizes information</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.839" end="01:03:25.920" style="s2">now how it does that and what we</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.319" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">actually mean by those terms</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.920" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">okay is is enormously complicated and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.319" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">how we embody that back into all these</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:36.640" style="s2">other domains of psychology</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">right exactly exactly okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.640" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">functionality of mental life the actual</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.799" style="s2">structure of phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:44.559" style="s2">and mindless behavior okay either in an</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.799" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">experimental condition or in an</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.559" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">adapter beautifully said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">beautifully said</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">okay so so what is actually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:53.039" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">right now so essentially what modern</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.039" end="01:03:56.839" style="s2">psychology is is it&#39;s a collection of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:04:00.880" style="s2">all that crap</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.839" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">okay it has a completely equivocating</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">cognitive mental process that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">sort of functional information</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:09.599" style="s2">thing okay with five percent of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:12.480" style="s2">psychologists still holding</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.599" end="01:04:14.400" style="s2">strong to skinner all right with all of</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.480" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">these different paradigms around it and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.400" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">then they say hey it&#39;s the science of</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">behavior and mental process but the key</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">thing is we do science</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:23.839" style="s2">that&#39;s how textbooks are and they never</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">tell you we actually well this is what</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.839" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">we mean by</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.880" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">mine this is what we mean by behavior</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:30.960" style="s2">and this is the scientific language game</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:33.200" style="s2">that we are playing</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.960" end="01:04:34.079" style="s2">that&#39;s and we don&#39;t know how to define</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.200" end="01:04:36.359" style="s2">those terms</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.079" end="01:04:38.400" style="s2">hence an enormous and uh completely</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.359" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">unsatisfactory language system</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.400" end="01:04:43.839" style="s2">and thus the pre multi-paradigmatic mess</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:45.200" style="s2">and then cognitive science comes along</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.839" end="01:04:46.400" style="s2">and says okay well we&#39;ll take care of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.200" end="01:04:49.760" style="s2">i&#39;m like well good luck</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.400" end="01:04:51.280" style="s2">yeah no for sure</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.760" end="01:04:52.319" style="s2">the thing is cognitive science was</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.280" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">supposed to be the solution to</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.319" end="01:04:54.960" style="s2">fragmentation</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">but there&#39;s also fragmentation within</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.960" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">cognitive science between the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:04:57.839" style="s2">computational evidence well now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:00.960" style="s2">consciousness studies right i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole like the arizona career</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.960" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">there&#39;s consciousness studies</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:06.720" style="s2">the entire system and that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">the issue is is that we&#39;ve exploded</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.720" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">there&#39;s equivocation there&#39;s enormous</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">and then it&#39;s huge it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.319" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">mass okay and then how do you create how</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">do you manage all of that inertia</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">and how do we understand what it is uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:21.119" style="s2">and and so instead</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">uh to untie the world not we have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.119" end="01:05:24.799" style="s2">understand that history</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">and and the task before us as far as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.799" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">is what will happen when it&#39;s done is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:32.240" style="s2">unified field frame</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:33.599" style="s2">okay that says oh i understand what they</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.240" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">were referring to</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.599" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">and their epistemology i understand how</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">each one of those domains were making</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:41.599" style="s2">and now conciliate wise we can make</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">sense of them all together there can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.599" end="01:05:46.799" style="s2">a jumping together of facts</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:49.680" style="s2">with coherence and clarity right</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.799" end="01:05:50.559" style="s2">okay that&#39;s excellent and then the idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.680" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.559" end="01:05:54.640" style="s2">that part of what we&#39;re doing is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">project is bound up</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.640" end="01:05:59.119" style="s2">and in dialogue with the project that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">got sort of from descartes and</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.119" end="01:06:02.240" style="s2">bobs right which is how you have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.240" end="01:06:06.960" style="s2">the hard problem of phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:09.280" style="s2">consciousness and its relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.960" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">conscious justification in humans and</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.280" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">embodiment and action</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">in animals down the line is unsolved</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:18.160" style="s2">but if we there&#39;s some sort of we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:19.920" style="s2">realize the relevance of a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.160" end="01:06:21.760" style="s2">that results in something we could piece</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">this thing together and have a good</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.760" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">language system and that&#39;s what i sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.079" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">you to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:29.680" style="s2">right on the trail of that&#39;s what yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s well said that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.680" end="01:06:31.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do right</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.520" end="01:06:35.599" style="s2">break your work and might work together</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">on that i wanted to point out one other</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.599" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">thing and you and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:41.680" style="s2">you uh there was an allusion to it um</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:44.640" style="s2">uh there&#39;s one other way in which this</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.680" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">is problematic which is as you said</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.640" end="01:06:49.039" style="s2">uh you said that um these texts i have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">third thing i&#39;m gonna probably i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.039" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">make this worse</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:53.520" style="s2">but i know it&#39;s already implicit in your</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:56.240" style="s2">work so i want to explicate</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.520" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">it right these textbooks not only fail</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.240" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">to tell you what</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:07:01.200" style="s2">mind is and what behavior is uh they</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:04.880" style="s2">tell you well they pro there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:06.640" style="s2">pretension</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.880" end="01:07:08.559" style="s2">in telling you what science is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:11.520" style="s2">philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.559" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">that is presupposed in sort of textbook</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.520" end="01:07:15.200" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:16.480" style="s2">is very very poor philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">the model of science there</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.480" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">like for example watson&#39;s uh what let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">just give one clear</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">quick example watson&#39;s idea that science</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:25.760" style="s2">works only in terms of observables</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">and never in terms of unobservable</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.760" end="01:07:30.480" style="s2">entities is just ridiculously false</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">i mean he&#39;s the point is he it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.480" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">anachronistic</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.599" end="01:07:35.359" style="s2">because of the time in which he was</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2">looking around and seeing science</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.359" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">but you know even by that time uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">scientists were</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.960" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">were pulling away from that model and</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">now of course</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2">most of the entities that science talks</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">about are not</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:50.000" style="s2">directly observable they&#39;re they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:53.520" style="s2">theoretically inferred</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.000" end="01:07:55.520" style="s2">and right and so completely right</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.520" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s not an exhaustive criticism</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.520" end="01:07:59.200" style="s2">like this thing i mean no that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:00.720" style="s2">listen that&#39;s an example right it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.200" end="01:08:02.960" style="s2">unbelievable nightmare and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.720" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">to me it&#39;s like okay we&#39;re gonna take</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.960" end="01:08:04.960" style="s2">this thing called the scientific method</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:06.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.960" end="01:08:09.039" style="s2">hey as long as you just follow that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.960" end="01:08:11.039" style="s2">know then you get what the answer is and</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.039" end="01:08:12.160" style="s2">man is there&#39;s nothing that we know more</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.039" end="01:08:15.359" style="s2">clearly you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.160" end="01:08:16.159" style="s2">cookie cutter okay yeah this method in</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.359" end="01:08:18.159" style="s2">parrot it</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.159" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">and then yield as if it&#39;s a well-defined</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.159" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">problem that you just follow the little</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:22.000" style="s2">recipes on and you get to the cake at</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:23.839" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.000" end="01:08:25.279" style="s2">that&#39;s not what this is and we in fact</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.839" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">know that it&#39;s not yet that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.279" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">taught i mean this is the third most cop</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:31.040" style="s2">popular major</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">psych 101 is like one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.040" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">popular courses</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:36.960" style="s2">and it provides no frame that what</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">they&#39;re being handed</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.960" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">i mean it took me a while really is</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">actually an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">gobbledygook</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">at a conceptually sophisticated level so</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:48.719" style="s2">so to me the problem of psychology both</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:50.799" style="s2">is a very important understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.719" end="01:08:52.239" style="s2">and it gets it gets into getting the</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.799" end="01:08:54.799" style="s2">proper metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.239" end="01:08:56.159" style="s2">ultimately of love of friendship of what</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.799" end="01:08:56.640" style="s2">it is that we&#39;re trying to do in this</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.159" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.640" end="01:09:01.359" style="s2">you know and and so that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:02.880" style="s2">the um why to me i&#39;m so passionate about</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.359" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">helping people realize there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.880" end="01:09:06.239" style="s2">we&#39;re we can just open your eyes see the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">history and see it</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.239" end="01:09:09.359" style="s2">right there there&#39;s really something</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">very important for us to try to uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.359" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">russell that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">okay i think we&#39;ve now i think we&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">between these four sessions i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">set up um at least an initially good</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">problem i think we got the problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.040" style="s2">formulation going</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">exactly i mean we&#39;re going to come back</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.040" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">to it because we&#39;re going to talk again</p>
