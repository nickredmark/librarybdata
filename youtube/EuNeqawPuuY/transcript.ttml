<p begin="00:00:03.490" end="00:00:07.530" style="s2">Thank you all very much, thank you Barbara,  and to everyone for</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.440" end="00:00:14.280" style="s2">First inviting me in, second for attending. So I&#39;m gonna try to do something</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.280" end="00:00:16.930" style="s2">very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.930" end="00:00:21.389" style="s2">This evening. I&#39;m going to try to put the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.029" end="00:00:25.859" style="s2">The rights, the right to free speech in the broadest possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.500" end="00:00:28.500" style="s2">historical context. I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.599" end="00:00:32.789" style="s2">want to start with a comment though, you know, we have a an idea built into our</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.790" end="00:00:37.829" style="s2">human rights legislation that all the rights are equal in some sense and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.530" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">that can&#39;t be true because</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.809" end="00:00:42.809" style="s2">rights conflict with one another and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.000" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">when things conflict they have to be hierarchically organized and what that means is that there&#39;s there&#39;s an implication that</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.420" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">there is a hierarchy of rights as well as a hierarchy of responsibilities and that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:00:59.819" style="s2">Incumbent on us to determine the nature of that hierarchy and to determine what constitutes the sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.219" end="00:01:06.929" style="s2">let&#39;s say the sovereign right and I would say you might think of that as a modern conundrum that would only</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.869" end="00:01:09.700" style="s2">be of interest to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.700" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">Countries that have formalized Bills of Rights for example, but it&#39;s not a new problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.960" end="00:01:18.779" style="s2">it&#39;s an extraordinarily old problem because there&#39;s no difference between</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.350" end="00:01:25.019" style="s2">Determining the hierarchy of your rights and determining how to live together successfully</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:31.919" style="s2">It is exactly the same problem one&#39;s only articulated in a legal form and the problem of how we should live together</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:35.099" style="s2">in the most productive possible manner</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.009" end="00:01:43.109" style="s2">Everything considered is as old as mankind itself. In fact, I would say far older than that because the same problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.110" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">Bedeviled social animals way down the phylogenetic chain. And so this is an unbelievably archaic problem now</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.820" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">years ago when I started</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.820" end="00:01:57.599" style="s2">thinking I suppose in earnest I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.840" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">was trying to address what I later recognized as a postmodern problem and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.469" end="00:02:07.210" style="s2">the problem was</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.210" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">This was in in the late 70s and early 80s when the Cold War was madly raging</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.820" end="00:02:17.279" style="s2">Because it peaked in 1962 and it peaked again and in about 1984 thereabouts</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:21.720" style="s2">and of course at that time people were very terrified about the potential outcome of the Cold War and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.090" end="00:02:27.270" style="s2">very good reason and I was curious about very curious about this like insanely curious about it it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.970" end="00:02:34.050" style="s2">Obsessing me I couldn&#39;t understand two things. I couldn&#39;t understand why the world had divided itself into two</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.810" end="00:02:36.670" style="s2">opposing narratives</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.670" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">why that would happen at all and and also why these</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.640" end="00:02:43.710" style="s2">Narratives were of such importance to people apparently that we were willing to arm ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.380" end="00:02:46.799" style="s2">Far beyond the teeth and risk</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.590" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">massive mutual annihilation</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:56.190" style="s2">to battle out the to battle out that conflict between these two ways of looking at the world and I was curious I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.530" end="00:03:02.220" style="s2">First the first question was were these merely two ways of looking at the world?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.980" end="00:03:07.559" style="s2">Because you might think well, there&#39;s there&#39;s no shortage of ways to live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.660" end="00:03:09.310" style="s2">That&#39;s a moral morally</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.310" end="00:03:13.619" style="s2">Relativistic stance and there&#39;s something to that obviously because people different people different</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.720" end="00:03:17.550" style="s2">Occupations and they different outlook and and so forth a difficult different political belief</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.550" end="00:03:21.270" style="s2">so there&#39;s obviously many ways that we can thrive in the world and so some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.520" end="00:03:24.990" style="s2">flexibility with regards to what constitutes your fundamental axioms</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.540" end="00:03:27.839" style="s2">Obviously is is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.630" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">But there&#39;s a deeper question and and it is a very deep question</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:37.469" style="s2">I actually think it&#39;s a it&#39;s the question at the bottom of the postmodern conundrum, which is whether or not there are any</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.290" end="00:03:44.849" style="s2">Reliable meta-narratives. Let&#39;s say overarching narratives that can unite people in some fundamental way. And so I was curious</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">Where were these just two arbitrary ways of looking at the world both?</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.690" end="00:03:51.690" style="s2">potentially equally valid and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.730" end="00:03:55.889" style="s2">We&#39;re we battling that out because we didn&#39;t know when there was no other way to battle it out</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.890" end="00:03:58.589" style="s2">Or was there something deeper at stake?</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:06.300" style="s2">was it possible that one or the other system was correct in some deep manner and I believe I do truly believe that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:08.650" style="s2">entered that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.650" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">That universe of questions. Let&#39;s say with as open as a mind as possible because I actually wanted to find out the answer</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">you know because well it seemed to me the fundamental question that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.510" end="00:04:23.879" style="s2">Obviously, we fought a whole Cold War about it was the fundamental question. Who was this?</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.880" end="00:04:27.559" style="s2">it was the question everyone&#39;s my should have been concentrated on and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.170" end="00:04:34.999" style="s2">Started to study deeply this this particular question. The first question was well, what were beliefs made out of like what exactly is it?</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.000" end="00:04:37.489" style="s2">What is it? What are we talking about when we talk about a belief?</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.490" end="00:04:41.060" style="s2">What does it mean that you have beliefs our beliefs structured?</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:42.630" style="s2">and also that was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.630" end="00:04:47.809" style="s2">psychological question rather than a political or economic question and that took me a long time to figure out because I didn&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.810" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">fundamental question was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:56.780" style="s2">Sociological or political or or economic or psychological energy turned out to be psychological or perhaps it turned out to be spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.780" end="00:04:58.780" style="s2">that&#39;s another way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.460" end="00:05:10.269" style="s2">If if you could grasp belief</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.690" end="00:05:17.199" style="s2">what would constitute a credible belief and what would it mean for a belief to be credible and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.479" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">I can give you a little a hint about that. I learned this from Jean Piaget that developmental psychologists brilliant brilliant theorists</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.330" end="00:05:31.660" style="s2">Genuine genius he was interested in how children organized games and he thought of games the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.930" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">Organization of games by children as the precursor to adult interaction and he made some very interesting observations about games</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:40.780" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.780" end="00:05:46.119" style="s2">especially pretend games which are quite sophisticated because children will get together and play pretend games and what they&#39;ll do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.580" end="00:05:48.609" style="s2">They act out a simulation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:55.030" style="s2">maybe they play house they all get together and they cast each other in different roles and then they each act out those rules and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.030" end="00:05:59.380" style="s2">they do that and then in order to simulate something important that they&#39;re going to have to adapt to but</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.570" end="00:06:06.099" style="s2">Piaget noted a couple of things the first thing, you know, that was that children playing games can play the games in a group</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.620" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">Thank you very much can play a game in a group</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.949" end="00:06:13.538" style="s2">But if you take them out of the group and you ask them what the rules of the game are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.539" end="00:06:15.539" style="s2">They don&#39;t know they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.800" end="00:06:18.009" style="s2">Articulate the rules of the game yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.009" end="00:06:22.509" style="s2">When you put them together in the group, they can play the game and I thought oh that&#39;s just like adults</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.969" end="00:06:30.009" style="s2">You see because because well because we wouldn&#39;t need a psychology otherwise, right because we&#39;d all be transparent to ourselves already</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:35.020" style="s2">So what that means is when we all get together and play a game like the one that we&#39;re playing in this room, for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.539" end="00:06:37.598" style="s2">We all can play the game when we&#39;re together</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.789" end="00:06:42.249" style="s2">but if we brought us out and said well, what are the rules we wouldn&#39;t be able to articulate them and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.380" end="00:06:45.699" style="s2">Then I thought well that means that those rules evolved in a real sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.699" end="00:06:47.599" style="s2">Like they&#39;ve evolved in a behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.599" end="00:06:53.229" style="s2">Competition and I thought well that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot like what&#39;s happening with animals if you look at how a chimpanzee troop is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.570" end="00:06:58.509" style="s2">Organized or a wolf pack any social animal for that matter going way down the phylogenetic chain</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.580" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">They have to interact with one another in a manner that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.430" end="00:07:08.650" style="s2">That sustains the group because otherwise they all die obviously and that sustains the individuals within the group and offers the individual some</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.780" end="00:07:13.719" style="s2">some scope of action and so there&#39;s a set of implicit constraints on the manner in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.120" end="00:07:16.929" style="s2">creatures interact or they don&#39;t live and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.510" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">Piaget also came to the same conclusion with regards to children&#39;s games. And and this is where he made a distinction. That&#39;s so crucial because</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.669" end="00:07:31.839" style="s2">Piaget was actually interested in bridging the gap between science and religion. That was his fundamental his fundamental motivation</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:35.500" style="s2">although very few people know that and he was interested in bridging the gap between</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:41.499" style="s2">Science and ethics and and he was interested in how ethics evolved as a as a concept and then as a practically applicable</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.860" end="00:07:48.729" style="s2">As something that was practically applicable and he made some very interesting comments about games and said well look</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.310" end="00:07:51.310" style="s2">What what constitutes a good game?</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.280" end="00:07:54.280" style="s2">well one rule is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.279" end="00:07:57.279" style="s2">everybody plays voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.979" end="00:08:01.538" style="s2">That&#39;s a really good game. And then he made another claim which was quite cool</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.539" end="00:08:05.408" style="s2">Which was imagine that you had a game a and E and B, and they were competing</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.050" end="00:08:11.770" style="s2">against the target and in in game B people were being forced to play and a game eight people were playing voluntarily and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.930" end="00:08:15.969" style="s2">Then you tracked their track record with regards to competitive advantage over time</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.099" end="00:08:22.539" style="s2">The game that people were playing voluntarily would win because the people who were playing wouldn&#39;t have to waste any effort and enforcement cost</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.539" end="00:08:24.609" style="s2">Oh god, that&#39;s so smart</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.680" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">It&#39;s so smart because because you can see the idea of the emergence of an ethic theory and not an ethic that&#39;s rationally constructed</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:34.658" style="s2">It&#39;s an ethic that&#39;s actually emerging from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.659" end="00:08:41.289" style="s2">Now if the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche also pointed out that our that our ethic actually emerged from the bottom up it wasn&#39;t rational</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.289" end="00:08:44.289" style="s2">It wasn&#39;t top down. It wasn&#39;t enlightenment oriented</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.290" end="00:08:46.290" style="s2">Even though the Enlightenment might have codified it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:51.640" style="s2">as part of a process of a codification that took place over a very long period of time and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">And then I read other things some say about the way that animals organize the troops. This was later</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.570" end="00:08:59.199" style="s2">but but but it&#39;s relevant to our talk today that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.630" end="00:09:04.630" style="s2">Primatologist friends to all for example has tried to find out what makes chimpanzee troops stable across time</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.469" style="s2">You know you kind of have this idea that a chimpanzee troop is driven</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.750" end="00:09:13.329" style="s2">Let&#39;s say by the most dominant powerful male the most aggressive cruel</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.060" end="00:09:19.419" style="s2">tyrannical chimpanzee dominates and that isn&#39;t what friends do all found what he found was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:24.730" style="s2">In order that those sorts of chimpanzee troops have leaders that meet very violent ends</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.250" end="00:09:33.099" style="s2">Because no matter how tyrannical you are as top chimp two chimps 3/4 your size can take you out and they will and chimpanzees are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.710" end="00:09:34.620" style="s2">believably</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.620" end="00:09:40.070" style="s2">Unbelievably brutal and very very strong and so tyrannical chimpanzee troops are unstable</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:42.300" style="s2">It&#39;s like that&#39;s a major league</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.300" end="00:09:49.909" style="s2">Discovery ma&#39;am because it starts to it starts to open up the possibility that the ethic upon which functional states are predicated is far deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">Than any mere story or any mere</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.230" end="00:09:57.709" style="s2">Rationality and that&#39;s a really exciting possibility because what it means is that there might be something at the bottom of our ethic</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.720" end="00:10:00.769" style="s2">That&#39;s really there. It&#39;s not just some arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.350" end="00:10:02.300" style="s2">constructed narrative</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.300" end="00:10:07.189" style="s2">it&#39;s not just one set of ways to live in the world among many and I would say I would say and I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.190" end="00:10:12.980" style="s2">Outline this partly in twelve rules for life and more in detail in maps of meaning that the evidence on that is already in</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">Is that there is a there is a convergent ethic that emerges from the bottom-up over</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.100" end="00:10:26.779" style="s2">Evolutionary spans of time over millions of years over hundreds of thousands of years over tens of thousands of years as people learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.090" end="00:10:30.379" style="s2">how to act in a manner that sustains them as</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.650" end="00:10:35.150" style="s2">Individuals now and a week from now and a month from now in a year from now</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.150" end="00:10:38.629" style="s2">So it has to be iterated that sustains them and their families</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.970" end="00:10:43.819" style="s2">Simultaneously that sustains them and their families and their communities across all those time frames</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.760" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">Simultaneously and that&#39;s a very very tight set of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:52.519" style="s2">And so there might be a very large number of ways to interpret the world as the postmodern set post</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.620" end="00:10:57.530" style="s2">Modernists accurately have it but there are not a very large number of ways to exist</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.050" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">Successfully in the world. In fact, it&#39;s extraordinarily constrained</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:03.619" style="s2">it&#39;s constrained by the neccessity of playing an</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.020" end="00:11:09.800" style="s2">Iterative voluntary game and that&#39;s a tight constraint. As any of you who are married know, right?</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.900" end="00:11:11.060" style="s2">well, I mean, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.060" end="00:11:16.670" style="s2">I mean<br />there&#39;s absolutely definitively because you see the marriage is a very interesting balancing act because</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.980" end="00:11:19.849" style="s2">It has to be good for you, and it has to be good for your wife</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.850" end="00:11:24.139" style="s2">let&#39;s say but it also has to be good for the two of you and it has to and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:27.950" style="s2">Superordinate to each of you as individuals and it has to be good for you in that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.950" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">That&#39;s good for your children</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:34.280" style="s2">And that has to work in society and it has to be something that you can play out moment by moment an hour to hour</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.280" end="00:11:37.309" style="s2">And day to day and month to month and week to week and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.320" end="00:11:43.309" style="s2">You know perfectly well that there isn&#39;t much deviation from the straight and narrow path if you&#39;re going to play that game</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.590" end="00:11:49.399" style="s2">Because there&#39;s just too many ways of falling into trouble and there&#39;s way ways of falling into trouble than not falling into trouble</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.530" end="00:11:54.500" style="s2">okay, so so that&#39;s the first thing so imagine this so this is the this is the idea so</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.140" end="00:12:01.910" style="s2">The ethic emerges from the bottom up as we learn how to organize ourselves in ever more complex society sustainable societies</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.910" end="00:12:03.810" style="s2">And we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.810" end="00:12:08.209" style="s2">Okay, but then what happens is because we&#39;re insanely curious and capable of self recognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.460" end="00:12:13.639" style="s2">We start to tell stories about how it is that we&#39;re acting and the stories have two forms</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.640" end="00:12:16.970" style="s2">one story is about the structures that we exist in and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.130" end="00:12:20.779" style="s2">That&#39;s the stories about other people and every stories about other people, right?</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.780" end="00:12:24.440" style="s2">Because we live in a social world and you never see a story. You never go to a movie</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.440" end="00:12:29.899" style="s2">You never read a novel that isn&#39;t about society and no wonder because that&#39;s our environment Society</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.900" end="00:12:36.350" style="s2">So stories are about Society and they&#39;re about how societies succeed and fail and they&#39;re about how individuals within that society</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.660" end="00:12:42.980" style="s2">Succeed or fail because what we&#39;re trying to do is to watch ourselves and I mean again over the mass of historical time frame</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.980" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to watch how it is that we act when we act properly and figure out how to do it as</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.430" end="00:12:52.159" style="s2">Individuals and the first way we do that is to code it in stories. That&#39;s what stories are for</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:54.080" style="s2">That&#39;s what great literature is for</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.080" end="00:12:59.480" style="s2">That&#39;s why there are great villains and great heroes and great literature because you want to know how to be a great hero</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.550" end="00:13:02.719" style="s2">Unless you want to be a great villain and if you want to be a great hero</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:07.490" style="s2">You can learn from great villains the opposite of how to act and so you get you get incredible</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.070" end="00:13:09.840" style="s2">Incredibly sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.840" end="00:13:13.730" style="s2">Representations emerging out of that process so that the take on an archetypal form</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:18.259" style="s2">So for example the the motif of the hostile brothers, which is developed into</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.810" end="00:13:20.810" style="s2">Christianity into them between</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.820" end="00:13:23.269" style="s2">adversaries of Christ and Satan or Cain and Abel are</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.580" end="00:13:29.270" style="s2">The idea of the hero who thrives in the social world and brings renewal to the cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.270" end="00:13:35.270" style="s2">So to speak against the deadly adversary and that&#39;s exactly what you need to know and again, it&#39;s not arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.270" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">It&#39;s not an arbitrary set of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:44.690" style="s2">It&#39;s predicated on the observation of successful and unsuccessful patterns of behavior over very very very very long stretches of time</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:47.719" style="s2">so there&#39;s a behavioral platform and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.990" end="00:13:50.370" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.370" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">representation of that platform then the two things start to interact because once you have drama and literature</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.280" end="00:13:59.750" style="s2">You can learn from drama and literature and alter how you behave and the irr ethic becomes portable</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.930" end="00:14:02.690" style="s2">and then what happens after that is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:11.960" style="s2">What happens after that is that thinkers who now have both the behavioural strata and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.360" end="00:14:14.360" style="s2">representational strata in front of them, right</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.940" end="00:14:18.589" style="s2">The procedural ethic the behavioral ethic plus the story</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.930" end="00:14:22.640" style="s2">Representation step one step back from that especially after it&#39;s written down</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:30.500" style="s2">this is why white works like the Bible or such critical importance because the the pattern the dramatic patterns are then written down and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.500" end="00:14:36.409" style="s2">You can step back from them with your consciousness and you can start to analyze them for their for the rule based content you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:39.229" style="s2">That emerging to some degree in the story of Moses</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.230" end="00:14:44.060" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what&#39;s laid out in part in the story of Moses because Moses is leading his people through the desert and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.279" end="00:14:50.599" style="s2">Watching how they fight and watching how they behave and then he has this so it&#39;s all very very dramatic. Then he has this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.149" end="00:14:54.349" style="s2">Revelation, which is this is how we already act</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.020" end="00:15:01.609" style="s2">Right. And so what happens is the rules are codified on the basis of the observation of the patterns that are already extent that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.649" end="00:15:05.149" style="s2">Functional that&#39;s a transformation of consciousness at that point</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.150" end="00:15:08.659" style="s2">You have your ethic which is far deeper than anything that you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.029" end="00:15:13.399" style="s2">Start to be articulated out into the body of laws and that&#39;s the point at which you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.560" end="00:15:19.400" style="s2">Let&#39;s say true philosophy at the beginning of the body of laws. It&#39;s called the body of laws for a reason and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.950" end="00:15:26.900" style="s2">well, I thought that was all just amazing to have to have to have observed that to think about that bottom-up process and then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.970" end="00:15:34.670" style="s2">Started reading a lot of religious mythology and I ran across this motif that was developed very in great detail by a Romanian</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.150" end="00:15:38.569" style="s2">Murchie le a de who was a great scholar of religions</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.240" end="00:15:42.469" style="s2">remarkable remarkable books including a history of religious ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.470" end="00:15:43.380" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.380" end="00:15:46.369" style="s2">Highly recommended book and he talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.650" end="00:15:51.650" style="s2">Interesting motif that I had run across and other writings on mythology and and and in religious stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.650" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">which was the Battle of the gods in heaven across time and one of the things Iliad I pointed out was that if you if</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.200" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">You looked at the development of religious system. So say the development of the religious system that came to dominate</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.399" end="00:16:08.839" style="s2">Mesopotamia when the Mesopotamian tribes came together imagine each of those tribes had their own God right and then when they came together</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.060" end="00:16:14.239" style="s2">That was terribly fractious because you know what happens when different people with different gods get to it&#39;s it&#39;s ugly</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.250" end="00:16:17.089" style="s2">It&#39;s ugly and it&#39;s no wonder because you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.089" end="00:16:21.319" style="s2">They all have an ethic and they they&#39;re living within the ethic and they&#39;re using it to structure their worlds</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.320" end="00:16:24.559" style="s2">but the ethics apparently collide and so what happens that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.170" end="00:16:31.580" style="s2">Civilizational level is that there&#39;s constant negotiation and cognitive transformation within the individual populations</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.580" end="00:16:38.419" style="s2">But that&#39;s represented over the large span of time as a battle between the gods that represent the different tribes in heaven. And so</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.970" end="00:16:45.529" style="s2">then what happens across time as all those gods organize themselves into a hierarchy and one God comes out on top and that God is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.529" end="00:16:50.898" style="s2">The supreme god and then this societies like Mesopotamia. Is that Mesopotamia that also happened in ancient Greece?</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:56.239" style="s2">They assumed that their sovereign is that the person who acts out the sovereign God</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.610" end="00:17:00.200" style="s2">Because you might say well where does the concept of sovereignty come from?</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.270" end="00:17:05.959" style="s2">Right, if it&#39;s not just brute force and it&#39;s not his brute force doesn&#39;t work. It has to have some other basis</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.959" end="00:17:13.159" style="s2">What&#39;s the basis of sovereignty? What&#39;s the basis of authority not power authority competence Authority, right?</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.160" end="00:17:13.579" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.579" end="00:17:19.549" style="s2">How&#39;s that played out it&#39;s played out by the battle between ethics systems of ethics that are represented in religious language</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.770" end="00:17:23.900" style="s2">across vast epochs of time and then the societies of gods</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.900" end="00:17:28.249" style="s2">let&#39;s say organize themselves into a hierarchy and they have a God at the top and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.620" end="00:17:32.390" style="s2">Laid right out in the anime ilish for example, which is the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.910" end="00:17:37.759" style="s2">Creation story that we have and out of which it&#39;s derived from the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.190" end="00:17:45.110" style="s2">what would you say cultural substrate is the stories in Genesis, for example, although it represents a variant the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.929" end="00:17:50.959" style="s2">Mesopotamians had all their gods aggregate themselves together because they were threatened by the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.960" end="00:17:55.610" style="s2">That&#39;s what happens in me in the Mesopotamian creation. Myth the unknown gives rise to the gods</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.650" end="00:18:02.989" style="s2">They become very fractious and compete and then the unknown decides to destroy them again like God destroying Noah Noah&#39;s people in the flood</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.990" end="00:18:05.990" style="s2">It&#39;s the same basic idea. There&#39;s an idea there and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.540" end="00:18:10.459" style="s2">We emerge out of the unknown and we&#39;re always threatened by it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:14.540" style="s2">Not only as individuals but as a group and that means that we need to figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.540" end="00:18:20.179" style="s2">That should guide us in order to continually confront the unknown and prevail and so what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.429" end="00:18:27.029" style="s2">Mesopotamia is the gods all get together in a congress and they basically they elect a new God and he new kind of God</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.340" end="00:18:32.069" style="s2">His name is marek. By the way, he has eyes all the way around his head and so he pays attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:36.209" style="s2">That&#39;s not the same as thinking. It&#39;s a different thing attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.210" end="00:18:37.870" style="s2">It&#39;s the same thing the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.870" end="00:18:44.039" style="s2">represented and worshiped with the eye of horus the idea that what you should do if you want to survive in this world if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.039" end="00:18:48.239" style="s2">Want to play a voluntary game that everybody could participate in your bloody eyes better be open</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.370" end="00:18:54.120" style="s2">because there are the things that will save you and that&#39;s attention and the other thing that mardik didn&#39;t he spoke magic words and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.309" end="00:18:58.529" style="s2">so when he spoke the night sky would appear the day sky would appear and so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.780" end="00:19:05.939" style="s2">Mesopotamians figured out in their great religious story that the fundamental sovereign God was he who pays attention and speaks the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:09.449" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:12.329" style="s2">That&#39;s not something you punish people for</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:20.669" style="s2">Right because there&#39;s this this is the deepest idea of mankind. It&#39;s developed in detail in Genesis in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.669" end="00:19:26.099" style="s2">It&#39;s the fundamental idea of Genesis that God uses the logos the word of God to cast</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.860" end="00:19:30.449" style="s2">Potential which we all face. That&#39;s what we face potentials, right?</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.450" end="00:19:33.450" style="s2">You know that you know that the future is unstructured</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.669" end="00:19:38.369" style="s2">You have a you have a potential within you that can meet that and there&#39;s a potential that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.620" end="00:19:41.939" style="s2">Characterizes the future you meet it with eyes open and with truthful speech</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.070" end="00:19:45.299" style="s2">And that&#39;s what happens in Genesis because God uses the logos</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.299" end="00:19:48.418" style="s2">Which is truthful speech to cast the pre cosmogonic</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:53.699" style="s2">Potential into habitable order and then he says it&#39;s good and there there&#39;s a hint there</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.159" end="00:19:56.140" style="s2">right because you think well is</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.140" end="00:20:02.219" style="s2">habitable order good because life is very difficult and it&#39;s a real question whether or not the order that we inhabit is good and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.380" end="00:20:04.380" style="s2">hypothesis in the Old Testament, is that if</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.690" end="00:20:09.090" style="s2">Truthful speech gives rise to the order then that order will be good</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.090" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">And that&#39;s really something that like that&#39;s really something to apprehend. It&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.970" end="00:20:17.289" style="s2">theological</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.289" end="00:20:21.389" style="s2">presupposition that the way that you take the potential upon which the cosmos is</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.490" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">Predicated and cast it into the order that allows everyone to thrive is by using</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:28.659" style="s2">truthful speech</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.659" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">Wouldn&#39;t it be something if that was the case and the thing is, you know, it&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.230" end="00:20:36.390" style="s2">You know it you know it because you do not admire yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.390" end="00:20:43.230" style="s2">If you&#39;re deceitful you admire yourself when you have those rare moments in your life where you can actually stand up and say what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.480" end="00:20:45.130" style="s2">regardless of the cost and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.130" end="00:20:52.619" style="s2">If you if you give that respect to other people if you treat them as if they&#39;re the locale of the divine speech that casts</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.750" end="00:20:54.310" style="s2">potential into habitable order</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.310" end="00:20:59.639" style="s2">Then they like you maybe they even love you and they get along with you and you could work with them and you can cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.640" end="00:21:06.210" style="s2">With them and you can compete with them. So not only is it the the fundamental axiom that regulates your relationship with yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.580" end="00:21:10.350" style="s2">It&#39;s the fundamental axiom that regulates your interactions with other people</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.350" end="00:21:17.399" style="s2">And if you do not give them that that honor which is the the presuppositions for their natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.400" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">right<br />Right because you&#39;re the idea that you have a natural right is the idea that you have some sort of intrinsic value</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.630" end="00:21:27.300" style="s2">If you don&#39;t paint treat people as if they have that intrinsic rate, they are not happy with you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.300" end="00:21:29.300" style="s2">Even if they don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.410" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">because everyone wants to be treated as if</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:33.989" style="s2">They have free will and as if they confront</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.090" end="00:21:40.289" style="s2">potential and as if they&#39;re capable of making moral choices and that they should be rewarded when they do things right and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.390" end="00:21:43.950" style="s2">Punished when they do things wrong, everyone wants that and everyone knows it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.770" end="00:21:49.020" style="s2">And so well, so what does that all have to do with free? Speech well</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:52.169" style="s2">Yes, everything that&#39;s exactly right. So</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.370" end="00:21:58.050" style="s2">Free speech isn&#39;t free speech. You know people think of free speech is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.690" end="00:22:02.879" style="s2">Kind of like a decoration something like that in your life, and it&#39;s not that at all</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.950" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">It&#39;s not the ability to speak truth to power. Although it is also that it&#39;s not that it&#39;s way more than that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.410" end="00:22:13.410" style="s2">Free speech is how you think?</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.750" end="00:22:19.859" style="s2">It&#39;s not thinking you know that the word that the Genesis relies on to create the cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.050" end="00:22:21.210" style="s2">Let&#39;s say in the story</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.210" end="00:22:26.819" style="s2">By the way, that&#39;s the image of God in which you&#39;re made male and female that gives you that fundamental value</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.820" end="00:22:31.889" style="s2">That&#39;s at the core of our idea of natural right? It&#39;s not thinking it&#39;s speaking</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.890" end="00:22:34.560" style="s2">And the reason for that is look first of all</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.560" end="00:22:35.770" style="s2">You can hardly think</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.770" end="00:22:40.619" style="s2">It&#39;s really hard to think you have to be trained like mad to think you have to be able to divide yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.780" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">Internally into a couple of different</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:47.220" style="s2">People and then you have to let those people have a war in your head and that means you have to develop</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.710" end="00:22:49.710" style="s2">characters who have opinions in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.820" end="00:22:53.419" style="s2">Great detail opinions that might be contrary to your own and then you have to withstand</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.490" end="00:22:56.750" style="s2">the tension of letting them have it out and you only see that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:00.079" style="s2">Thinking in great literature like you see that in Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:02.210" style="s2">He&#39;s an absolute master of that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.460" end="00:23:06.409" style="s2">You can think a little bit but mostly you&#39;re biased and you have confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.510" end="00:23:07.010" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.010" end="00:23:11.930" style="s2">And you see things the way you see them and you have massive blind spots and you&#39;re ignorant as hell you just you just you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.940" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">Just can&#39;t think but you can talk and the thing is if you talk other people will correct you</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.670" end="00:23:19.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.530" end="00:23:25.340" style="s2">Thinking so if you get up and you have some something to say and you say it stupidly because of course you will because what?</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.340" end="00:23:29.990" style="s2">Do you know then other people will tell you where you&#39;re wrong and then you can learn right?</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.990" end="00:23:34.849" style="s2">And then everybody can think and so what that also means is that to be free to speak</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.070" end="00:23:40.759" style="s2">Even to tell the truth means you have to be free to be stupid and ignorant and malevolent and bitter</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.040" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">Because that is who you are. That is what you are cuz you&#39;re flawed</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.950" end="00:23:52.490" style="s2">So the idea that you know, you can&#39;t use your free speech if it&#39;s offensive, it&#39;s just it&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.490" end="00:23:57.019" style="s2">That is so evident. You don&#39;t know if it&#39;s naivety. Oh does it&#39;s malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.020" end="00:23:59.900" style="s2">It&#39;s a real battle which of the which of those two things are worse</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.900" end="00:24:05.210" style="s2">I would go with malevolence because it detract some it attacks something. That&#39;s so absolutely fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.210" end="00:24:09.169" style="s2">It&#39;s like well, of course people who are speaking freely are going to be offensive</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.170" end="00:24:14.420" style="s2">I mean, have you ever had a serious discussion with anyone in your life and I mean a serious discussion?</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.420" end="00:24:19.850" style="s2">I mean this sort of discussion you have when you&#39;re with your wife when you&#39;re wondering whether your marriage is going to survive or you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.010" end="00:24:24.620" style="s2">Or with your kids when they&#39;ve done something that is really not in their best long-term interest</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.620" end="00:24:28.819" style="s2">I mean a serious discussion. You can&#39;t even get off the ground without being offensive</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.920" end="00:24:32.840" style="s2">You can&#39;t get off the ground without offending yourself in a conversation like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.840" end="00:24:38.870" style="s2">You don&#39;t even want to admit how you feel or how you think to yourself if you think you can have a difficult conversation?</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.090" end="00:24:42.709" style="s2">Without offending people all that means is you&#39;re not having a difficult conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.470" end="00:24:50.569" style="s2">Because for an easy conversation by definition, no one gets upset about that. There&#39;s no real problem. There&#39;s no real disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.570" end="00:24:54.230" style="s2">There&#39;s and there&#39;s no real real world problem to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.290" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">It&#39;s just trivial it&#39;s like discussing, you know, last night&#39;s sports event</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.700" end="00:24:59.730" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.730" end="00:25:02.870" style="s2">If you&#39;re going to have a conversation about something that matters</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.870" end="00:25:07.179" style="s2">you know in the world made out of what matters that&#39;s a good thing to remember if you&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.340" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">Discussion about what matters if you&#39;re really going to talk about it?</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.389" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">Everyone is going to be offended by that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:18.549" style="s2">Especially if there&#39;s something rotten in the state of Denmark and you happen to either one in Tripoli that is pointing it out</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.740" end="00:25:23.589" style="s2">So then you think well your freedom of speech that&#39;s not about you being able to speak truth to power</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.720" end="00:25:28.629" style="s2">That&#39;s about you being able to chart your destiny in the world and more than that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.629" end="00:25:33.189" style="s2">it&#39;s even more than that&#39;s important enough because you know life is hard and if you don&#39;t get to think</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.909" style="s2">When you when you walk through your life, you will fall into a pit</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.909" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">There&#39;s no doubt about that because that&#39;s what thinking is for is to stop you from having anymore</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.049" end="00:25:45.969" style="s2">Catastrophes that are absolutely necessary and it&#39;s a terribly difficult process</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.970" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">And so if if that&#39;s interfered with it, isn&#39;t that you don&#39;t get to speak truth to power</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:56.499" style="s2">It&#39;s that you do not get to act in the world in a manner that allows you to to eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:01.299" style="s2">Endless unnecessary hellish suffering and not just for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.299" end="00:26:05.528" style="s2">But for you and your family and your community and so the enemies of free speech</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.529" end="00:26:09.909" style="s2">They&#39;re the enemies of the process that turns potential into habitable order</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.909" end="00:26:14.439" style="s2">They&#39;re our enemies of the Divine Principle and worse. They&#39;re their own enemies</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.169" end="00:26:19.599" style="s2">right because this isn&#39;t well some of us believe in free speech and some of us don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.789" end="00:26:21.139" style="s2">It&#39;s way deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.139" end="00:26:25.419" style="s2">If you don&#39;t believe in free speech you don&#39;t believe in the implicit divinity of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.419" end="00:26:32.049" style="s2">You don&#39;t believe in the sovereignty of the individual you don&#39;t believe in sovereignty as such you&#39;re a totalitarian of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.049" end="00:26:36.819" style="s2">Which means you attribute all the divine power to yourself. It&#39;s and then we know where that leads, right</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.820" end="00:26:42.009" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s on the right or the left if we had any sense and we took a look at 20th century history</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.009" end="00:26:46.389" style="s2">We know exactly where things go and we could easily choose not to go there</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.389" end="00:26:50.049" style="s2">And so when we see someone like reiieve who&#39;s imprisoned by a reprehensible?</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.629" end="00:26:55.419" style="s2">dictatorship that we have the gall to call our allies then what we see is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.269" end="00:27:04.089" style="s2">System that&#39;s not only hell bent on the destruction of an innocent and good man, but but directly</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.759" end="00:27:09.519" style="s2">antithetical to everything that all of us have and there are societies put forward as</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.039" end="00:27:15.339" style="s2">necessary to the continual betterment of being itself and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.129" end="00:27:30.868" style="s2">And I&#39;ve been so absolutely appalled by the Western world&#39;s we need response to the attacks of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.239" end="00:27:38.459" style="s2">Totalitarians upon our freedom of speech the what was done with Salman Rushdie. That was a big big big big mistake, right?</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.499" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">Because it wasn&#39;t Rushdie</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:46.409" style="s2">It was the free speaking artistic tradition of the West and not only of the West right the free speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.509" end="00:27:50.789" style="s2">Artistic creative tradition upon which the cosmos is properly established</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.429" end="00:27:53.968" style="s2">That&#39;s what it was and we all bow down</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.759" end="00:27:59.009" style="s2">We all bow down with no resistance whatsoever. It was a massive error</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.009" end="00:28:03.299" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna pay for that for a very long time. We did the same thing with the Danish cartoons</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.929" end="00:28:12.028" style="s2">And you don&#39;t want to think about these sorts of things as happening far away</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.279" end="00:28:16.588" style="s2">Nothing happens far away when it happened somewhere else is happening right here, too</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.589" end="00:28:20.339" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here today because we recognize that at least on some level and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.710" end="00:28:26.999" style="s2">We have to stop we need to stop being so naive about our let&#39;s say our moral relativism</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.999" end="00:28:33.358" style="s2">We need to take a look at history and biology in a very very fundamental way and we need to really understand what our culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.940" end="00:28:36.899" style="s2">What our culture and and genuine cultures everywhere?</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.269" end="00:28:45.088" style="s2">predicated on and that is the idea that the sovereign voice of the individual is the power that casts potential into habitable being and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.639" end="00:28:48.118" style="s2">Restructures tyrannical order when it needs to be restructured</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.489" end="00:28:48.989" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.989" end="00:28:53.669" style="s2">And that&#39;s what each of us are that&#39;s the divine presence in each of us and I do believe that there is no more</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.830" end="00:28:59.819" style="s2">Fundamental truth than that, I don&#39;t believe that you can date down underneath that. I think that&#39;s bedrock</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.820" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">That&#39;s the foundation stone of the house</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">That&#39;s the cornerstone of the house and it requires everyone to courageously confront the tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:14.189" style="s2">that&#39;s them and the unknown that surrounds them and to work for their own benefit and for the benefit of their families and for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.190" end="00:29:20.999" style="s2">Benefit of their communities and to do everything they can to benefit the world and to live with true speech as the highest value</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.009" end="00:29:24.029" style="s2">That&#39;s how we sort out the world and we could sort it out</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.029" end="00:29:28.679" style="s2">We are sorting it out at a very rapid rate and we could do that much much more effectively</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.679" end="00:29:34.919" style="s2">If now I do believe that it&#39;s incumbent on us to understand the absolutely fundamental role that these processes take</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.920" end="00:29:38.759" style="s2">I know we&#39;re here today because we all have at least an intimation of that, right?</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.760" end="00:29:40.770" style="s2">We know that there&#39;s something about free speech</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.770" end="00:29:46.290" style="s2">That&#39;s so central that we cannot allow attacks on it to go unchallenged no matter where they occur</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.750" end="00:29:51.000" style="s2">But it&#39;s very useful to have it articulated and to know that this is bedrock</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.000" end="00:29:56.609" style="s2">right<br />And it&#39;s not something arbitrary and it&#39;s not a mere game a mere game that we&#39;re only playing in the West none of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.740" end="00:30:02.760" style="s2">It&#39;s something it&#39;s the most fundamental truth that the human race has ever discovered and we we lose it at our absolute</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.400" end="00:30:04.980" style="s2">Peril, and it&#39;s not death</p>
