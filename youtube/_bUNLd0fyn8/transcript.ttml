<p begin="00:00:02.820" end="00:00:08.760" style="s2">change strategist so I help people</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.629" end="00:00:10.889" style="s2">design changes in culture and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.760" end="00:00:13.769" style="s2">things that I want to share is a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.889" end="00:00:15.480" style="s2">old very simple practice that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.769" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">extremely valuable for creating</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.480" end="00:00:19.770" style="s2">large-scale change and that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:23.430" style="s2">large-scale change in your own life like</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.770" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">for restructuring how you live to become</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.430" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">more healthy and more happy or bored</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.830" end="00:00:31.430" style="s2">scale change as in impacting large</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">numbers of people and changing the</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">community in both cases there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:43.100" style="s2">simple a very profound thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:47.070" style="s2">can do and that is to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.100" end="00:00:50.309" style="s2">large changes happen by taking a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.070" end="00:00:54.739" style="s2">sequence of small simple steps so if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">are to start out with a simple task that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.739" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">you understand to build toward a big</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:02.809" style="s2">goal then you just perform that task</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">well and then move on to the next task</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.809" end="00:01:08.130" style="s2">and as an example of how this works in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:11.210" style="s2">very practical way something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.130" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">been doing for years is practicing a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.210" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">particular kind of stretching fitness</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">training that I&#39;ve learned from many</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">years of studying dance and martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">when I was younger and what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">put together a sequence of stretching</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">and moving exercises that take between</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:37.470" style="s2">60 and 90 minutes if I do all of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:39.030" style="s2">and what I find myself doing from time</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.470" end="00:01:41.700" style="s2">to time is elapsing from doing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">activity and my body becomes more stiff</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">and more strained and I&#39;m more prone to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">injury and more likely to become sick so</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">what I do is I reintroduce the practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">of daily stretching now daily stretching</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">is something that is best done with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">very simple routine to follow where you</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">know what your first movement is and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">naturally leads to the second movement</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">which leads to the third movement so my</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">stretch routine starts with the rolling</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">of my neck</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:12.770" style="s2">followed by</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:14.240" style="s2">putting my head side to side and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.770" end="00:02:16.910" style="s2">doing some movements with my shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.240" end="00:02:20.740" style="s2">and my arms kind of working from the top</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.910" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">of my body downward and then doing some</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.740" end="00:02:25.580" style="s2">no ankle foot movements knee and hip</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:26.690" style="s2">movements to loosen up the joints</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.580" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">throughout my body</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.690" end="00:02:31.850" style="s2">before starting deep stretches I know</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:35.570" style="s2">what&#39;s amazing about this stretch</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.850" end="00:02:38.240" style="s2">routine is not what it does in any given</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.570" end="00:02:40.610" style="s2">day so if I do this routine for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.240" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">today makes a little difference I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.610" end="00:02:45.620" style="s2">definitely feel better I have more</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:49.310" style="s2">energy but what really is amazing is if</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.620" end="00:02:51.650" style="s2">I do this stretch routine every day over</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:54.290" style="s2">and over again about three years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.650" end="00:02:56.810" style="s2">did this where I did my 60-minute</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.290" end="00:03:00.170" style="s2">stretch routine every day for seven</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.810" end="00:03:02.870" style="s2">straight months where I only missed the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.170" end="00:03:05.330" style="s2">routine on something like three or four</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.870" end="00:03:07.700" style="s2">of those days so for more than a half a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.330" end="00:03:09.890" style="s2">year I did an hour of stretching every</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.700" end="00:03:14.450" style="s2">day and what I noticed was that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.890" end="00:03:17.420" style="s2">gradually built up a very different body</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.450" end="00:03:19.850" style="s2">that I had when I started so I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.420" end="00:03:22.670" style="s2">notice myself reaching new plateaus of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.850" end="00:03:25.340" style="s2">physical ability and fitness every few</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.670" end="00:03:28.340" style="s2">weeks and I noticed that I had a much</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.340" end="00:03:31.480" style="s2">deeper awareness and sensitivity to my</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.340" end="00:03:34.550" style="s2">body that gradually developed over time</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.480" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">so by doing the stretch routine of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.550" end="00:03:40.550" style="s2">sequence of simple positions and moves</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:44.269" style="s2">every day day after day week after week</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.550" end="00:03:45.650" style="s2">month after month I built up a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.269" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">different kind of body and a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.650" end="00:03:50.510" style="s2">different kind of lifestyle for health</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:52.700" style="s2">and fitness so in the same way we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.510" end="00:03:55.010" style="s2">to think about what it&#39;s like to go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.700" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">college and to get a degree where you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.010" end="00:03:59.780" style="s2">master a field of study so I did this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:02.390" style="s2">for physics once upon a time I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.780" end="00:04:04.550" style="s2">learn all the physics in one day I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.390" end="00:04:06.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t sit down and download it with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.550" end="00:04:10.070" style="s2">microchip the way that neo did in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.440" end="00:04:13.010" style="s2">Matrix movies I was able to go through a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.070" end="00:04:15.380" style="s2">curriculum for years of Education where</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.010" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">every day at least during the times in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.380" end="00:04:19.200" style="s2">schools in session I would go to a class</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:21.570" style="s2">sit for an hour with a professor and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.200" end="00:04:23.550" style="s2">they would go through one or two topics</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.570" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">and we would then go and do a set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.550" end="00:04:28.139" style="s2">exercises some problem sets over the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:30.450" style="s2">next few days and we&#39;d bring them back</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.139" end="00:04:32.100" style="s2">to class and over the period of several</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.450" end="00:04:34.410" style="s2">years I learned a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.100" end="00:04:37.080" style="s2">thinking which was the mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.410" end="00:04:42.300" style="s2">analysis and the scientific method of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.080" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">physics so the thing that I&#39;m wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.300" end="00:04:47.850" style="s2">convey here is that this way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:50.340" style="s2">methodically approaching a long process</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.850" end="00:04:52.260" style="s2">of change as a way of achieving larger</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.340" end="00:04:55.050" style="s2">goals is something that is tried and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.260" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">true throughout history it&#39;s a you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.050" end="00:04:59.640" style="s2">call it a best practice a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:02.190" style="s2">tradition something that is a tried and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.640" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">true in many different cultural settings</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.190" end="00:05:07.860" style="s2">and something that I can validate from</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.810" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">my own life experience so as you set</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.860" end="00:05:12.450" style="s2">your own New Year&#39;s resolutions as many</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:15.960" style="s2">of you may be prone to do at this time</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.450" end="00:05:19.200" style="s2">of year think about how you&#39;re illogical</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.960" end="00:05:22.979" style="s2">whatever it may be is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.200" end="00:05:26.930" style="s2">achievable but only if you consistently</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.979" end="00:05:32.789" style="s2">methodological or methodically patiently</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.930" end="00:05:35.190" style="s2">build up a change over time so I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.789" end="00:05:36.539" style="s2">this in my own work so for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.190" end="00:05:38.580" style="s2">followed my work and seeing the things</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.539" end="00:05:41.300" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been able to accomplish over</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.580" end="00:05:45.479" style="s2">the span of several years you&#39;d see that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.300" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">some very large high-profile impacts</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.479" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">some positive outcomes came about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:52.860" style="s2">many people would say oh how is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:56.810" style="s2">even possible how did you do that well</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.860" end="00:06:01.620" style="s2">my answer is that I trust this process</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.810" end="00:06:04.470" style="s2">so when I left my ph.d program ten years</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.620" end="00:06:05.820" style="s2">ago to set out on a different path to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.470" end="00:06:08.970" style="s2">study the cognitive and behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.820" end="00:06:11.460" style="s2">sciences and try to apply it to global</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.970" end="00:06:12.840" style="s2">sustainability issues then I moved</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.460" end="00:06:14.760" style="s2">through a process of learning about</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.840" end="00:06:16.830" style="s2">political behavior and working in</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.760" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">politics and you can see every step of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.830" end="00:06:21.510" style="s2">the way if you were to zoom in and watch</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:24.320" style="s2">what I was doing on a daily basis you</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.510" end="00:06:27.690" style="s2">would see that I was practicing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.320" end="00:06:29.439" style="s2">skill and that&#39;s how I&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.690" end="00:06:33.099" style="s2">build up to the place that I am today</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.439" end="00:06:33.669" style="s2">and I now routinely set large goals for</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.099" end="00:06:36.129" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.669" end="00:06:39.909" style="s2">they take months or years to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.129" end="00:06:43.959" style="s2">and then I practice the patients and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.909" end="00:06:46.599" style="s2">introspection and the daily rituals that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.959" end="00:06:48.550" style="s2">I need which I usually don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.599" end="00:06:49.929" style="s2">those rituals are when I start so I also</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.550" end="00:06:52.089" style="s2">have a process of figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.929" end="00:06:54.519" style="s2">those are to build up to the place where</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.089" end="00:06:55.719" style="s2">I can achieve big things and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.519" end="00:06:57.069" style="s2">something that I&#39;d like for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.719" end="00:06:59.259" style="s2">other people to learn how to do and</p>
