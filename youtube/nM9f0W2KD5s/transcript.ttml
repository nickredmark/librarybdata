<p begin="00:00:08.870" end="00:00:13.469" style="s2">hello and welcome to the portals first</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.250" end="00:00:16.170" style="s2">episode today I&#39;ll be sitting down with</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.469" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">Peter teal now if you&#39;ve been following</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.170" end="00:00:20.670" style="s2">me on Twitter or perhaps as a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">guest on other podcasts you may know</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.670" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">that I work for teal capital but one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:27.150" style="s2">the things that people ask me most</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">frequently is given that you are so</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.150" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">different than your boss and friend</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">Peter teal how is it the two of you get</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:35.489" style="s2">along what is it that you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">where do you agree in disagree now oddly</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.489" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">Peter and I both do a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">public speaking but I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever appeared in public together</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">and very few people have heard our</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">conversations what&#39;s more he almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">never mentions me and I almost never</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">mentioned him in our public lives</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">so hopefully this podcast will give some</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">indication of what a conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">like is somebody who I find one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">most interesting and influential</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">teachers of our time somebody who has</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">influenced all sorts of people in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">Silicon Valley involved with technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">and inventing tomorrow and who is often</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">not seen accurately in my opinion by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">commentariat and the regular people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">a pine as pundits in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">science and technology I hope you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">find Peter as fascinating as I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:25.460" style="s2">without further ado this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:25.460" style="s2">episode of the portal thanks for joining</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.670" end="00:01:30.360" style="s2">hello and welcome you found the portal</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">I&#39;m your host Eric Weinstein and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.360" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">this is our first interview show to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">debut and I&#39;m here with my good friend</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:37.799" style="s2">and employer mr. Peter Tila Peter</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:39.030" style="s2">welcome to the portal well Eric thanks</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.799" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">for having me on your program know this</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.030" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">is a great honor one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">think is kind of odd is is that lots of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:48.750" style="s2">people know that I work for you and many</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">people know that we&#39;re friends but even</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.750" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">though we both do a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">public speaking I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">appeared anyplace in public together is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">that your recollection as well I I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">think of a single occasion so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">proves were not the same person we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">not the same person you were not my</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">alter ego but you know on that front I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">think it is kind of an odd thing for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">I mean we met each other I think when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:14.190" style="s2">was in my late 40s and if you&#39;d ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:15.630" style="s2">told me that the person who would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.190" end="00:02:18.090" style="s2">most likely to complete my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.630" end="00:02:19.740" style="s2">accurately would be you I never would</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:21.900" style="s2">have believed it never having met you we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.740" end="00:02:25.320" style="s2">have somewhat opposite politics we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.900" end="00:02:28.710" style="s2">very different life histories how do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.320" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">think it is that we&#39;ve come to share</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.710" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">such a lot of thinking I mean I have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.610" style="s2">say that a lot of my ideas are cross</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">pollinated with yours so you occur in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.610" end="00:02:41.130" style="s2">lot of my my standard riffs how do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:43.230" style="s2">think that is that we came to different</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.130" end="00:02:45.960" style="s2">conclusions but share so much of a body</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:47.850" style="s2">of thought it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.960" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">I&#39;m always hard-pressed to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.850" end="00:02:51.720" style="s2">since the conclusions all seem correct</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">to me so you know it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.720" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s always mysterious why why we</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:03:00.270" style="s2">right it feels like we&#39;re the outliers</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">and we&#39;re the only or among the very few</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.270" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">people that reach some of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:05.690" style="s2">conclusions about sort of the relative</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:08.580" style="s2">stagnation and science and technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.690" end="00:03:11.400" style="s2">the ways in which this is arranging our</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">culture our politics our society and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.400" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">then how we need to try to find some</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:19.110" style="s2">some bold ways out some bold ways to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:22.470" style="s2">find a new portal to different a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.110" end="00:03:23.940" style="s2">different world and and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.470" end="00:03:26.790" style="s2">sort of different ways the two of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:28.830" style="s2">came at this I feel like you got you got</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.790" end="00:03:31.340" style="s2">to some of these um perspectives at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.830" end="00:03:34.020" style="s2">very early point sort of the mid-1980s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.340" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">that something was incredibly off I</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.020" end="00:03:40.680" style="s2">probably got there in the early mid 90s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">when I was from this tract law firm job</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:44.910" style="s2">in New York City and somehow everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.410" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">felt like it was more like a Ponzi</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">scheme it wasn&#39;t really going towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:50.820" style="s2">the future everyone had promised you and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:03:52.440" style="s2">in the sort of elite you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.820" end="00:03:55.380" style="s2">undergraduate in law school education I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.440" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">had gone through and so yes I think I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.380" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">think we&#39;re sort of point we we got to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">these insights but it&#39;s it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:06.360" style="s2">striking how um you know how how out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">sync they feel with with so much of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.360" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">society even even in 2019 yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:12.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a very striking thing for me and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:14.700" style="s2">it&#39;s also something that&#39;s frustrated me</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.570" end="00:04:16.769" style="s2">sometimes when I look forward to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.700" end="00:04:19.560" style="s2">being interviewed is that it often feels</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.769" end="00:04:22.350" style="s2">to me that so much time is spent on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:24.450" style="s2">initial question like are we somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.350" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">stagnating in science and technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.450" end="00:04:27.980" style="s2">that rather than assuming that as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:29.720" style="s2">conclusion which I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.980" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">make a pretty convincing argument that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.720" end="00:04:33.320" style="s2">there has been a lot of stagnation it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:35.270" style="s2">seems to me that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.320" end="00:04:37.100" style="s2">conversations hang at an earlier level</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.270" end="00:04:39.350" style="s2">and so one of the things that I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.100" end="00:04:41.630" style="s2">hoping to do in this which is I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.350" end="00:04:45.140" style="s2">your second long-form podcast you did</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:47.750" style="s2">Dave Rubin show some time ago is to sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.140" end="00:04:49.370" style="s2">of presuppose some of the basics that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.750" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">people will be familiar with who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.370" end="00:04:54.140" style="s2">following either one of us or both of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:56.980" style="s2">and to get to the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.140" end="00:05:00.980" style="s2">conversation that I think never gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.980" end="00:05:03.010" style="s2">explained and discussed because people</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.980" end="00:05:07.210" style="s2">are always so hung up at the initial</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.010" end="00:05:11.720" style="s2">frame issue so with your indulgence</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.210" end="00:05:14.630" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.720" end="00:05:17.420" style="s2">and I see and any differences that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.630" end="00:05:21.080" style="s2">might have about this period of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.420" end="00:05:25.190" style="s2">that we find ourselves in in 2019 what</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.080" end="00:05:27.770" style="s2">would you say is the dominant narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.190" end="00:05:30.550" style="s2">before we get to what might be our</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.770" end="00:05:33.200" style="s2">shared kind of counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.550" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">well um you know the dominant narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.200" end="00:05:37.160" style="s2">is probably fraying and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:40.640" style="s2">fraying for some time but it it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.160" end="00:05:44.270" style="s2">something like you know we&#39;re in a world</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.640" end="00:05:47.060" style="s2">of generally fast scientific and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.270" end="00:05:48.890" style="s2">technological progress things are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.060" end="00:05:51.410" style="s2">getting better all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.890" end="00:05:53.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some imbalances that maybe need</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.410" end="00:05:55.400" style="s2">to be smoothed out there&#39;s some corner</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.480" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">case problems maybe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.400" end="00:06:00.230" style="s2">dystopian risks because the technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:06:02.510" style="s2">so fast and so scary it might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.230" end="00:06:06.170" style="s2">destructive but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a generally</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.510" end="00:06:08.030" style="s2">acceleration ax story and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.170" end="00:06:10.610" style="s2">some sort of micro adjustments within</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.030" end="00:06:14.570" style="s2">that that that one would have to would</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.570" end="00:06:18.410" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of are all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.550" end="00:06:20.480" style="s2">that I think it&#39;s fraying you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.410" end="00:06:22.460" style="s2">think 2008 was a big watershed moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.480" end="00:06:24.310" style="s2">but but that&#39;s still what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.460" end="00:06:26.990" style="s2">largely largely been holding together</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.310" end="00:06:28.970" style="s2">and then you know there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.990" end="00:06:31.100" style="s2">different institutions when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.970" end="00:06:33.230" style="s2">you can look at the universities where</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.100" end="00:06:34.790" style="s2">you know sort of this attract thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.230" end="00:06:36.920" style="s2">costing more every year but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.790" end="00:06:39.830" style="s2">worth it it&#39;s still an investment in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.920" end="00:06:41.879" style="s2">future and and this was probably already</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.830" end="00:06:44.129" style="s2">questionable in the 1980s nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.879" end="00:06:45.809" style="s2">in college debt in the United States in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.129" end="00:06:47.879" style="s2">2000 was three hundred billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.809" end="00:06:50.520" style="s2">now it&#39;s around you know 1.6 1.7</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.879" end="00:06:53.189" style="s2">trillion and so there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.520" end="00:06:56.129" style="s2">the story was shaky 20 years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.189" end="00:06:59.099" style="s2">today is is much Shaker it&#39;s still sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.129" end="00:07:03.300" style="s2">of holding together somehow so in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.099" end="00:07:05.669" style="s2">story in essence the great dream is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.300" end="00:07:07.559" style="s2">your children will become educated they</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.669" end="00:07:09.330" style="s2">will receive a college education they</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.559" end="00:07:12.509" style="s2">will find careers and then in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.330" end="00:07:14.219" style="s2">bright and dynamic society they can look</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.509" end="00:07:16.949" style="s2">forward to a future that is brighter</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.219" end="00:07:19.259" style="s2">than the future that previous</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.949" end="00:07:21.149" style="s2">generations look forward to yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.259" end="00:07:22.589" style="s2">now again I think I think people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.149" end="00:07:25.019" style="s2">hesitant to actually articulated quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.589" end="00:07:26.339" style="s2">that way because that already sounds not</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.019" end="00:07:27.929" style="s2">quite true to well there&#39;s a year to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.339" end="00:07:30.509" style="s2">your point they&#39;ve been adding epicycles</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.929" end="00:07:32.429" style="s2">for some time so so it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.509" end="00:07:34.709" style="s2">bright future but it&#39;s really different</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.429" end="00:07:35.819" style="s2">from the parents we can&#39;t quite know and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.709" end="00:07:37.649" style="s2">they&#39;ve you know they have all these uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.819" end="00:07:39.149" style="s2">these new devices they have an iPhone</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.649" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">and they can text really fast in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.149" end="00:07:42.449" style="s2">iPhone we can&#39;t even understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:45.089" style="s2">younger generation is doing so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.449" end="00:07:47.009" style="s2">so maybe it&#39;s better on it but better</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.089" end="00:07:49.379" style="s2">has sort of an objective scale maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.009" end="00:07:50.969" style="s2">it&#39;s just different and unmeasurable but</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.379" end="00:07:52.439" style="s2">but better in sort of an unmeasurable</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.969" end="00:07:54.180" style="s2">way so they&#39;re sort of our ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.439" end="00:07:56.729" style="s2">gotten modified but but that would still</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.180" end="00:07:59.519" style="s2">be you know very powerfully intact</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.729" end="00:08:01.949" style="s2">narrative and then and then that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.519" end="00:08:03.839" style="s2">are sort of straightforward things we</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.949" end="00:08:07.229" style="s2">can be doing the system&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.839" end="00:08:08.789" style="s2">working and it&#39;s basically gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.229" end="00:08:10.469" style="s2">continue to work and there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.789" end="00:08:13.139" style="s2">global version of this there&#39;s a US</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.469" end="00:08:14.219" style="s2">version there&#39;s a upper-middle-class US</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.139" end="00:08:17.009" style="s2">version there are a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.219" end="00:08:20.279" style="s2">variations on this so it always strikes</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.009" end="00:08:23.789" style="s2">me that one of the things that you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.279" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">very well is that you&#39;re willing and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.789" end="00:08:27.179" style="s2">know you&#39;re famously a chess player</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to make certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.179" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">sacrifices in order to advance a point</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:35.579" style="s2">and in this case I think you and I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">both agree that there are certain areas</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.579" end="00:08:42.689" style="s2">that have continued to follow the growth</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:44.430" style="s2">story more than the general economy and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.689" end="00:08:46.439" style="s2">that you have to kind of give those</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.430" end="00:08:48.660" style="s2">stories their due before you get to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.439" end="00:08:51.199" style="s2">this new picture where do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.660" end="00:08:54.600" style="s2">future has been relatively more bright</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.199" end="00:08:55.260" style="s2">in recent years well again I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.600" end="00:08:57.480" style="s2">I sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.260" end="00:08:59.190" style="s2">date the this era of stagnate relative</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.480" end="00:09:00.930" style="s2">stagnation and slowed progress all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.190" end="00:09:02.970" style="s2">way back to the 1970 so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.930" end="00:09:06.210" style="s2">been close to half a century that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.970" end="00:09:09.870" style="s2">been in this in this era of seriously</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.210" end="00:09:12.090" style="s2">slowed slowed progress obviously a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.870" end="00:09:15.000" style="s2">big exception this has been the world of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.090" end="00:09:18.150" style="s2">bits computers internet mobile internet</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.000" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">software and so Silicon Valley has</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.150" end="00:09:24.360" style="s2">somehow been this up in this dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:27.150" style="s2">exception you know it and where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.360" end="00:09:29.280" style="s2">world of atoms it has been has been much</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.150" end="00:09:30.660" style="s2">slower for for something like 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.280" end="00:09:33.390" style="s2">and you know when I was an undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.660" end="00:09:35.430" style="s2">at Stanford in the late 1980s almost all</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.390" end="00:09:37.410" style="s2">engineering disciplines in retrospect</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.430" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">were really bad feels to go into people</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.410" end="00:09:40.500" style="s2">already knew at the time you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:43.020" style="s2">go into nuclear engineering aero-astro</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.500" end="00:09:44.490" style="s2">was a bad idea but you know Chemical</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.020" end="00:09:46.710" style="s2">Engineering mechanical engineering all</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.490" end="00:09:49.260" style="s2">these things were were bad fields</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.710" end="00:09:51.000" style="s2">computer science was that would have</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.260" end="00:09:53.490" style="s2">been a very good field to go into and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.000" end="00:09:56.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s been sort of a an area where</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.490" end="00:09:58.500" style="s2">there&#39;s been tremendous growth so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.040" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">thought that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.500" end="00:10:02.730" style="s2">the the signature one that I would I</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:05.400" style="s2">would uh I would cite there questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.730" end="00:10:08.340" style="s2">about you know how healthy it is at this</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.400" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">point even within that field so so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.340" end="00:10:12.330" style="s2">know there&#39;s the iPhone is now looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.440" end="00:10:15.690" style="s2">the same as it did seven eight years ago</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.330" end="00:10:17.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s the iconic invention not quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.690" end="00:10:19.260" style="s2">so sure and so there&#39;s been sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.400" end="00:10:20.280" style="s2">definitely a change in the tone even</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.260" end="00:10:23.160" style="s2">within Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.280" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">in the last five six years on on this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.160" end="00:10:27.870" style="s2">but that that had been that had been one</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.820" style="s2">that was very very decoupled on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.870" end="00:10:33.240" style="s2">decoupling itself had had some odd</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.820" end="00:10:35.580" style="s2">effects where where if you have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.240" end="00:10:39.060" style="s2">a narrow cone of progress around this</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.580" end="00:10:40.980" style="s2">world of vets then the people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.060" end="00:10:42.660" style="s2">the those parts of the economy have more</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.980" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">to do with atoms will feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.660" end="00:10:46.680" style="s2">being left behind so there was something</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:50.340" style="s2">there was something about the tech</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.680" end="00:10:52.080" style="s2">narrative that had this very um didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.340" end="00:10:54.450" style="s2">necessarily feel inclusive didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.080" end="00:10:56.100" style="s2">like like everybody was getting ahead in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.450" end="00:10:59.010" style="s2">one of the ways I&#39;ve described it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.100" end="00:11:00.270" style="s2">that we live in a world where I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.010" end="00:11:02.550" style="s2">know we&#39;ve been working on the Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.270" end="00:11:04.440" style="s2">computer in Silicon Valley but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.550" end="00:11:06.210" style="s2">have anything else from Star Trek we</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.440" end="00:11:08.100" style="s2">don&#39;t have the warp drive we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.210" end="00:11:09.080" style="s2">the transporter can&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.100" end="00:11:11.870" style="s2">re-engineer</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.080" end="00:11:15.050" style="s2">in sort of this cornucopia world where</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.870" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">there&#39;s no scarcity and and then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.050" end="00:11:18.200" style="s2">know how good is a society where you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:20.269" style="s2">have a well-functioning Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.200" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">computer but nothing else from Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.269" end="00:11:24.589" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s incredibly juicy I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:27.100" style="s2">of the ways that I attempted to encode</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.589" end="00:11:29.720" style="s2">something which in part I got from you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.100" end="00:11:31.610" style="s2">was to say of course your iPhone is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.720" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">amazing it&#39;s all that&#39;s left of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.610" end="00:11:35.660" style="s2">once limitless future because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">collision of the communications and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.660" end="00:11:41.560" style="s2">semiconductor revolutions that did seem</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:44.470" style="s2">to continue and I I date the the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.560" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">break in the economy to something like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.470" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">1972 73 74 it&#39;s really quite sharp in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:56.329" style="s2">mind is it that way in yours yes it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:58.940" style="s2">was probably like I&#39;d say 1968 people</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.329" end="00:12:01.910" style="s2">still you know the the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.940" end="00:12:03.769" style="s2">progress seemed intact on 73 it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.910" end="00:12:05.899" style="s2">somehow over so somewhere in that in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.769" end="00:12:08.630" style="s2">that five year period you know one I</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.899" end="00:12:10.070" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve sort of had you know the 1969</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.630" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">version was we landed on the moon in</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">starts three weeks later and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.940" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one way you could describe</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:20.180" style="s2">the cultural shift you can describe it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:23.959" style="s2">in terms of the oil shocks of 1973 at</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.180" end="00:12:24.890" style="s2">the at the back end there probably you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.959" end="00:12:26.839" style="s2">know with with the benefit of hindsight</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.890" end="00:12:28.850" style="s2">the were things are already framed by</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.839" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">the late 1960s so the environment was</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.850" end="00:12:32.270" style="s2">getting dramatically worse you have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.820" style="s2">right the Graduate movies you should go</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.270" end="00:12:37.430" style="s2">into plastics I think it was 1968 or 69</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.820" end="00:12:39.860" style="s2">and that would have you know that would</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.430" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">have um so there were sort of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.860" end="00:12:44.870" style="s2">were where the story was fraying but but</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:48.980" style="s2">I think was still broadly intact in 1968</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.870" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">and somehow seemed very off by 73 now</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.980" end="00:12:53.209" style="s2">something that actually I&#39;m scanning my</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:55.940" style="s2">memory and I don&#39;t know that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.209" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">this conversation so I&#39;m curious to hear</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.940" end="00:13:01.730" style="s2">your answer one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:04.640" style="s2">found surprising is that I think I can</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.730" end="00:13:08.029" style="s2">tell a reasonably decent story about how</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.640" end="00:13:11.060" style="s2">this is a result of a scientific problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.029" end="00:13:14.930" style="s2">rather than the mismanagement of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.060" end="00:13:17.199" style="s2">future do you believe that if we assume</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.930" end="00:13:20.120" style="s2">that there was this early 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.199" end="00:13:22.490" style="s2">structural change in the economy that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.120" end="00:13:24.860" style="s2">was largely a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.490" end="00:13:26.990" style="s2">sort of man-made problem which is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.860" end="00:13:30.770" style="s2">we seemingly implicitly always assumed</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.990" end="00:13:32.930" style="s2">or might it be a scientific one and let</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.770" end="00:13:34.670" style="s2">me give you the one exotic example that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.930" end="00:13:37.940" style="s2">really kind of drives it home for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.670" end="00:13:40.670" style="s2">I think quarks were discovered in 1968</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.940" end="00:13:42.890" style="s2">and to find out that the proton and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.670" end="00:13:45.890" style="s2">neutron are comprised of up and down</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.890" end="00:13:48.170" style="s2">quarks is an incredible change in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.890" end="00:13:52.400" style="s2">picture of the world yet it has no</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.170" end="00:13:54.920" style="s2">seeming implications for industry and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.400" end="00:13:58.850" style="s2">I started thinking about this question</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.920" end="00:14:01.010" style="s2">are we somehow fenced out of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.850" end="00:14:02.900" style="s2">technologies are to come that we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.010" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">exhausted one orchard of low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.900" end="00:14:09.230" style="s2">fruit and haven&#39;t gotten to the next yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:10.940" style="s2">um yes so there&#39;s always I think one one</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.230" end="00:14:13.490" style="s2">one way to parse this question of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.940" end="00:14:16.730" style="s2">scientific technological stagnation is</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.490" end="00:14:18.860" style="s2">sort of nature versus culture um didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.730" end="00:14:20.690" style="s2">ate the ideas in nature run out or at</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.860" end="00:14:21.860" style="s2">least the useful ideas maybe we find</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.690" end="00:14:24.170" style="s2">make some more discoveries but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.860" end="00:14:26.510" style="s2">not useful or the easily useful easily</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.170" end="00:14:28.580" style="s2">useful it&#39;s the sort of nature so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.510" end="00:14:30.170" style="s2">problem with nature and then the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.580" end="00:14:31.850" style="s2">cultural problem is that there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.170" end="00:14:33.770" style="s2">actually a lot to be discovered or a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.850" end="00:14:35.870" style="s2">that could be made useful but somehow</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.770" end="00:14:38.450" style="s2">the culture had gotten gotten deranged</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.870" end="00:14:40.340" style="s2">and I sort of go back and forth on those</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.450" end="00:14:42.950" style="s2">two explanations I think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.340" end="00:14:46.970" style="s2">it&#39;s very complicated obviously we had</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.950" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">um I think in physics you&#39;d say even</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.970" end="00:14:50.390" style="s2">though you know I mean probably even the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">fundamental discovery stopped after the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.390" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">mid-1970s but but certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:56.150" style="s2">translation didn&#39;t happen quarks don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:58.070" style="s2">matter for chemistry and chemistry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.150" end="00:15:00.140" style="s2">what matters on a you know on a human</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.070" end="00:15:02.510" style="s2">level I would I would say there was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.140" end="00:15:04.760" style="s2">lot that happened in biochemistry so</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.510" end="00:15:06.710" style="s2">sort of the you know not chemistry down</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.760" end="00:15:10.820" style="s2">to sort of chemistry up the interface</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.710" end="00:15:13.250" style="s2">between chemistry and biology and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.820" end="00:15:15.830" style="s2">where I would be inclined to say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:17.390" style="s2">a lot more that could happen and has not</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.830" end="00:15:19.880" style="s2">quite happened because maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.390" end="00:15:21.050" style="s2">problems are hard maybe but maybe also</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.880" end="00:15:23.270" style="s2">the cultural institutions for</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.050" end="00:15:24.860" style="s2">researching them are a restrictive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.270" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">too heavily regulated in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.860" end="00:15:28.850" style="s2">and and it&#39;s been just somewhat slower</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:31.460" style="s2">than one would have expected in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:33.410" style="s2">1970s so maybe it&#39;s really just a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.460" end="00:15:35.960" style="s2">constant dialogue between nature and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.410" end="00:15:37.960" style="s2">culture yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.960" end="00:15:40.610" style="s2">obviously because obviously if nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.960" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">has stopped then the culture is going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.610" end="00:15:44.870" style="s2">do range so there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.250" style="s2">culture is linked to nature and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.870" end="00:15:48.410" style="s2">know the culture deranged is it also</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.250" end="00:15:50.630" style="s2">will look like nature stops so so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.410" end="00:15:53.630" style="s2">think these things are theirs they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.630" end="00:15:57.080" style="s2">probably elements of both but I am I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.630" end="00:15:59.210" style="s2">always um optimistic in the sense that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.080" end="00:16:00.050" style="s2">think we could have done better I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.210" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">we could do better</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.050" end="00:16:03.260" style="s2">I think there are you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:05.840" style="s2">necessarily the case that we can advance</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.260" end="00:16:08.120" style="s2">on all fronts in every direction but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.840" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">think there there&#39;s more space on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.120" end="00:16:12.440" style="s2">frontier than just in this world of bits</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">so I think there are various dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.440" end="00:16:16.190" style="s2">on atoms where we could and we could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:17.750" style="s2">advancing and we just we just have</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.190" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">chosen not to why do you think it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.750" end="00:16:23.960" style="s2">hard to convince people that because</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:25.580" style="s2">both of us have had this experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.960" end="00:16:27.110" style="s2">where we sit down let&#39;s say to an</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.580" end="00:16:31.220" style="s2">interview and somebody talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.110" end="00:16:33.800" style="s2">dizzying pace of change and both you and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.220" end="00:16:36.470" style="s2">I see almost I mean it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.800" end="00:16:40.070" style="s2">objectively true I have this test which</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.470" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2">is going to a room and subtract off all</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.070" end="00:16:44.780" style="s2">of the screens yes how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.500" end="00:16:48.290" style="s2">you&#39;re not in 1973 but for issues of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.780" end="00:16:51.140" style="s2">design there aren&#39;t that many clues yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.290" end="00:16:52.610" style="s2">there are well let&#39;s you know all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.140" end="00:16:53.840" style="s2">of things one can one can point to I</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.610" end="00:16:55.850" style="s2">mean you know I always point to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.840" end="00:16:57.200" style="s2">productivity data and economics which</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.850" end="00:16:57.590" style="s2">aren&#39;t great and then you get into</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.200" end="00:16:59.240" style="s2">debates</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.590" end="00:17:01.490" style="s2">you know how accurately are those being</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.240" end="00:17:04.100" style="s2">measured you um you have the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.490" end="00:17:06.080" style="s2">intergenerational thing where you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.100" end="00:17:07.640" style="s2">our generation Gen X is at a tougher</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.080" end="00:17:09.320" style="s2">time than the boomers the Millennials</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.640" end="00:17:12.020" style="s2">seem to be having a much tougher time</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.320" end="00:17:13.220" style="s2">then you know either us or the boomers</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.020" end="00:17:15.500" style="s2">had so there seems to be this</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.220" end="00:17:17.540" style="s2">generational thing so there are some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.500" end="00:17:20.030" style="s2">these sort of macroeconomic variables</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.540" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">that seem that seem pretty off the UM</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.030" end="00:17:26.060" style="s2">the direct scientific questions I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:28.250" style="s2">are very hard to get a handle on and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.060" end="00:17:30.410" style="s2">reason for this is that in late</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.250" end="00:17:33.350" style="s2">modernity which we&#39;re living it on</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.410" end="00:17:35.660" style="s2">there&#39;s simply too much knowledge for</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.350" end="00:17:38.810" style="s2">any individual human to understand all</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.660" end="00:17:41.090" style="s2">of it and so you know and so the the and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.810" end="00:17:43.160" style="s2">so in this world of extreme hyper</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.090" end="00:17:46.550" style="s2">specialization where it&#39;s narrower</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.160" end="00:17:48.110" style="s2">narrower subsets of experts policing</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.550" end="00:17:49.169" style="s2">themselves and talking about how great</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.110" end="00:17:50.789" style="s2">they are this</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.749" end="00:18:04.259" style="s2">that all these fields not much is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.190" end="00:18:05.820" style="s2">happening people just don&#39;t have the</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.889" end="00:18:21.149" style="s2">where 1900 Hilbert could still</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.149" end="00:18:26.429" style="s2">and and so the sort of um the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.029" end="00:18:28.679" style="s2">specialization I think has made it a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.429" end="00:18:30.690" style="s2">much harder question to get a handle on</p>

<p begin="00:18:37.590" end="00:18:42.029" style="s2">suspicious it should because it&#39;s gotten</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.929" end="00:18:43.559" style="s2">harder to evaluate what&#39;s going on then</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.029" end="00:18:45.960" style="s2">it&#39;s presumably gotten easier for people</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.559" end="00:18:47.639" style="s2">to lie and to exaggerate and then one</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.960" end="00:18:49.980" style="s2">should be a little bit suspicious and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.639" end="00:18:52.289" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a sort of my starting my</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.980" end="00:18:55.950" style="s2">starting bias well in mind mine as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.289" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">and I think perhaps sort of the craziest</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.950" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">idea to come out of all of this and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:04.259" style="s2">again you met your version of this in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:05.940" style="s2">law firm which is predicated upon the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.259" end="00:19:07.590" style="s2">idea that a partner would hire</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.940" end="00:19:09.090" style="s2">associates and the associates would hope</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.590" end="00:19:10.710" style="s2">to become partners who could then hire</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.090" end="00:19:12.629" style="s2">associates and so that has that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.710" end="00:19:14.850" style="s2">pyramidal structure and in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.629" end="00:19:16.590" style="s2">university system every professor is</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.210" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">graduate students and I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.450" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">know the universities were probably the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:28.039" style="s2">most aggressive of these sort of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:31.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve called embedded growth obligations</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.039" end="00:19:34.769" style="s2">but the implication of this idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.830" end="00:19:36.929" style="s2">structured almost everything on an</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.769" end="00:19:39.269" style="s2">expectation of growth and then this</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.929" end="00:19:40.889" style="s2">growth that was expected ran out it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.269" end="00:19:43.139" style="s2">wasn&#39;t as high and as stable and as</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.889" end="00:19:46.529" style="s2">technologically led as before has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.139" end="00:19:50.070" style="s2">pretty surprising implication which is I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.529" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">mean let&#39;s not dance around it it feels</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.070" end="00:19:55.409" style="s2">like almost universally all of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:57.389" style="s2">institutions are now pathological or</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.409" end="00:19:59.999" style="s2">sociopathic or whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.389" end="00:20:03.149" style="s2">them yes yes I suppose there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.999" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">two two ways one could imagine going</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.149" end="00:20:08.339" style="s2">you know you had these expectations of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:09.869" style="s2">great growth great expectations he&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.889" end="00:20:18.089" style="s2">and then you can try to UM be honest and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.869" end="00:20:20.339" style="s2">say the expectations are dialed down or</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.089" end="00:20:22.139" style="s2">you can continue to say everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.339" end="00:20:23.429" style="s2">great and it just happens not to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.139" end="00:20:26.669" style="s2">working out for you but it&#39;s working out</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.429" end="00:20:29.519" style="s2">for people in general and and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.669" end="00:20:32.909" style="s2">it&#39;s been very hard to have the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.519" end="00:20:35.129" style="s2">honest reset and and and the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.909" end="00:20:37.139" style="s2">have been for the institutions to drange</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.129" end="00:20:39.299" style="s2">until I so there&#39;s a pop there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.139" end="00:20:41.700" style="s2">probably a way the universities could</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.299" end="00:20:43.139" style="s2">function if they did not grow you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.700" end="00:20:45.149" style="s2">you&#39;d be honest most people in PhD</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.139" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">programs don&#39;t become professors maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.149" end="00:20:48.839" style="s2">you&#39;d make the PhD programs much shorter</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:50.849" style="s2">maybe it&#39;d be much more selective you</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.839" end="00:20:53.190" style="s2">let fewer people and there would be some</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.849" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">way you could sort of adjust it and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.190" end="00:20:57.539" style="s2">institutions could still be much</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:59.609" style="s2">healthier than they are today but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.539" end="00:21:01.559" style="s2">that&#39;s not the path that that&#39;s seeming</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.609" end="00:21:03.029" style="s2">that was taken and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.559" end="00:21:05.609" style="s2">something like this could have been done</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.029" end="00:21:08.070" style="s2">in the law firm context or maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.609" end="00:21:09.839" style="s2">um you uh you still at the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.070" end="00:21:12.029" style="s2">percentage of people become partner but</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.839" end="00:21:13.289" style="s2">the partners don&#39;t get don&#39;t make quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.029" end="00:21:14.759" style="s2">as much money as before or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.289" end="00:21:17.249" style="s2">like that so that there would have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.759" end="00:21:18.659" style="s2">ways when one could have gone but those</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.249" end="00:21:21.389" style="s2">were generally not the choices that were</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.659" end="00:21:23.339" style="s2">made yeah I wonder if that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.389" end="00:21:25.019" style="s2">possible because if you had a law firm</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.339" end="00:21:26.639" style="s2">that was honest or a university that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.019" end="00:21:29.460" style="s2">fairly honest and you had one that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.639" end="00:21:32.639" style="s2">dishonest it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.460" end="00:21:35.580" style="s2">dishonest one could attempt to use its</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.639" end="00:21:37.289" style="s2">prestige to out-compete the honest one</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.580" end="00:21:41.009" style="s2">and so that would become a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.289" end="00:21:44.029" style="s2">self-extinguishing strategy unless you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.009" end="00:21:47.849" style="s2">somehow had like a truth in advertising</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.029" end="00:21:49.979" style="s2">program yeah I I I don&#39;t know you know I</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.849" end="00:21:51.779" style="s2">I do think the truth you know when it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.979" end="00:21:53.940" style="s2">breaks through you&#39;re better off having</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.779" end="00:21:56.460" style="s2">told it than not not having and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.940" end="00:21:58.679" style="s2">always it as long as everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.460" end="00:22:00.779" style="s2">dishonest it could work</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.679" end="00:22:02.339" style="s2">well this and that&#39;s but ya know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.779" end="00:22:04.440" style="s2">look it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mysterious to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.339" end="00:22:06.479" style="s2">me how long it worked we had you know we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.440" end="00:22:08.489" style="s2">had these crazy bubble economies in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.479" end="00:22:10.889" style="s2">you know we had the the tech bubble in</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.489" end="00:22:12.119" style="s2">the 90s the housing bubble in the 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.889" end="00:22:16.090" style="s2">you know what I think is a government</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.119" end="00:22:18.610" style="s2">debt bubble you know this last decade</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.090" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">and so if you&#39;ve had this sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.610" end="00:22:24.550" style="s2">know up down bubble that&#39;s um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:26.710" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of harder to see than if</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.550" end="00:22:30.220" style="s2">things were just flat so if the growth</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.710" end="00:22:33.220" style="s2">in 1970 things just flatlined in the end</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.220" end="00:22:35.350" style="s2">you had 40 years of no growth that would</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.220" end="00:22:37.420" style="s2">have been problematic and you might have</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.350" end="00:22:39.670" style="s2">noticed that very quickly right but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.420" end="00:22:41.680" style="s2">know in a sense simplifying a lot you</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.670" end="00:22:44.350" style="s2">could say we had you know the 70s were</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.680" end="00:22:47.800" style="s2">down the 80s were up the 90s were up the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.350" end="00:22:50.230" style="s2">2000s were down so two down two up net</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.800" end="00:22:51.400" style="s2">flat but it didn&#39;t feel that way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.230" end="00:22:52.930" style="s2">like internally there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.400" end="00:22:55.810" style="s2">excitement a lot of stuff happened and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.930" end="00:22:58.060" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s in California was like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.810" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">even more extreme version of this you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.060" end="00:23:01.930" style="s2">know the last you know the last three</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:03.130" style="s2">recessions in California were much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.930" end="00:23:05.880" style="s2">severe than in the country as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.130" end="00:23:08.890" style="s2">the recoveries were steeper and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.880" end="00:23:11.020" style="s2">California&#39;s felt incredibly volatile</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.890" end="00:23:14.380" style="s2">the volatility gets interpreted as</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.020" end="00:23:16.090" style="s2">dynamism and then and then people and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.380" end="00:23:19.570" style="s2">then before you know it 30 or 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.090" end="00:23:23.400" style="s2">have passed one thing that I I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.570" end="00:23:26.110" style="s2">curious about is how this discipline</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.400" end="00:23:28.510" style="s2">seems to have arisen where almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.110" end="00:23:31.300" style="s2">everyone representing the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.510" end="00:23:35.140" style="s2">who tell some version of this universal</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.300" end="00:23:38.350" style="s2">story which I&#39;ll be honest to my way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.140" end="00:23:40.150" style="s2">thinking can be instantly invalidated by</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.350" end="00:23:42.070" style="s2">anyone who chooses to do so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.150" end="00:23:43.870" style="s2">that the cost of invalidating it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.070" end="00:23:46.390" style="s2">quite high</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.870" end="00:23:48.700" style="s2">you know Paul Krugman wrote this column</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.410" end="00:24:33.700" style="s2">the individual incentives were very</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.910" end="00:24:35.050" style="s2">different from the collective inside the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.700" end="00:24:37.060" style="s2">collective incentive we should have not</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.050" end="00:24:38.620" style="s2">honest conversation and right level set</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.060" end="00:24:40.900" style="s2">things and get get back to a better</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.620" end="00:24:42.850" style="s2">place I think the individual incentives</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.900" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">were often you pretend that it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.850" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">great for you it&#39;s like if you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.440" end="00:24:47.080" style="s2">know the twenty thousand people here who</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:49.300" style="s2">moved to Los Angeles to become movie</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.080" end="00:24:50.410" style="s2">stars about twenty of them make it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.300" end="00:24:52.060" style="s2">so you could say well it&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.410" end="00:24:54.310" style="s2">hard nobody wants to hire me this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.060" end="00:24:56.290" style="s2">terrible city or you could say you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.310" end="00:24:58.420" style="s2">this has been wonderful that all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.290" end="00:25:00.580" style="s2">doors are being opened to me and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.420" end="00:25:02.410" style="s2">the second one is more fictional but</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.580" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.410" end="00:25:05.680" style="s2">thing you&#39;re supposed to say if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:06.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re succeeding and there&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.680" end="00:25:08.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a way this is how we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.760" end="00:25:10.750" style="s2">talking about globalization where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.770" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2">sort of a glib globalization it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.750" end="00:25:15.460" style="s2">working great for me and and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.240" end="00:25:16.990" style="s2">have more people um more talented people</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.460" end="00:25:19.450" style="s2">come to the US I&#39;m not scared of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.990" end="00:25:22.690" style="s2">competing with them and an on and on so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.450" end="00:25:24.700" style="s2">this sort of is is this um yeah this or</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.690" end="00:25:26.290" style="s2">academia if you&#39;re you know if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.700" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">professor in academia so the tenure</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.290" end="00:25:30.040" style="s2">system is great it&#39;s just picking the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">most talented people I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.040" end="00:25:34.060" style="s2">that hard at all it&#39;s it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.470" style="s2">meritocratic and if you don&#39;t say those</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.060" end="00:25:38.200" style="s2">things well we know you&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.470" end="00:25:40.120" style="s2">person to get tenure yeah it&#39;s so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.200" end="00:25:43.480" style="s2">think so I think there is sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.120" end="00:25:46.030" style="s2">individual incentive where um you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.480" end="00:25:48.280" style="s2">supposed if you if you pretend the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.030" end="00:25:49.870" style="s2">system&#39;s working you&#39;re simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.280" end="00:25:52.870" style="s2">signalling that you&#39;re one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.870" end="00:25:54.970" style="s2">people who should succeed in it so one</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.870" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">image that I have in a you know you and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.970" end="00:26:02.350" style="s2">I have talked I use the word kayfabe for</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:03.850" style="s2">the system of nonsense that undergirds</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.350" end="00:26:06.460" style="s2">professional wrestling and you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.850" end="00:26:11.890" style="s2">taken to using LARPing a live-action</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.460" end="00:26:14.530" style="s2">role-playing it strikes me that we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.890" end="00:26:16.540" style="s2">two separate parallel systems now this</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.530" end="00:26:20.560" style="s2">podcasting experiment that you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.540" end="00:26:24.430" style="s2">now part of provides for a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.560" end="00:26:26.500" style="s2">unscripted out-of-control narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.430" end="00:26:29.170" style="s2">then there&#39;s this parallel institutional</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.500" end="00:26:31.330" style="s2">narrative that seems to exist in a gated</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.170" end="00:26:33.700" style="s2">form where the institutions keep talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.330" end="00:26:36.700" style="s2">to each other and ignore this thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.700" end="00:26:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s happening that has reached more</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.700" end="00:26:42.700" style="s2">and more people so that you effectively</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.280" end="00:26:45.400" style="s2">have multiple narratives one of which</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.700" end="00:26:47.410" style="s2">I think almost no one needs to believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.400" end="00:26:50.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just that the institutions need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.410" end="00:26:52.600" style="s2">trade kind of lies and deceptions back</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.110" end="00:26:53.980" style="s2">and forth amongst themselves how is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.600" end="00:26:55.720" style="s2">that these two things can be kept</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.980" end="00:26:57.850" style="s2">separate it&#39;s like a real wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.720" end="00:27:01.210" style="s2">league and a professional wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.850" end="00:27:02.620" style="s2">league side by side where somehow they</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.210" end="00:27:05.950" style="s2">just don&#39;t come into contact with each</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.620" end="00:27:08.740" style="s2">other well I um well I think if they</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.950" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">came into contact something they could</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.740" end="00:27:12.040" style="s2">then they wouldn&#39;t both be able to exist</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:14.770" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s not surprising that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.040" end="00:27:16.690" style="s2">they can&#39;t cut contact I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.770" end="00:27:19.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a terribly you know I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.690" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s alt ultimately stable so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.210" end="00:27:25.750" style="s2">ultimately you know our account is going</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:27.610" style="s2">to prevail on the institutional account</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.750" end="00:27:30.850" style="s2">is so incorrect that it will ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.610" end="00:27:33.850" style="s2">fail I&#39;ve probably been more hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.850" end="00:27:36.370" style="s2">about how quickly truth prevails then it</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:38.710" style="s2">has but in forever I would still I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.370" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">still be very hopeful that that that our</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.710" end="00:27:41.920" style="s2">account is really gonna break through</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:43.990" style="s2">and you know in the next few years I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.920" end="00:27:47.500" style="s2">been talking about the this the the tech</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.990" end="00:27:49.720" style="s2">stagnation problem for for you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.500" end="00:27:51.880" style="s2">better part of a decade and I think when</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.720" end="00:27:55.090" style="s2">I was talking about this in 2008 2009</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.880" end="00:27:57.580" style="s2">2010 this was still you know a frenzied</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.090" end="00:28:00.010" style="s2">view it was very fringy within Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.580" end="00:28:02.140" style="s2">Valley and I think even within Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.010" end="00:28:03.760" style="s2">Valley there&#39;s sort of a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.140" end="00:28:06.550" style="s2">who&#39;ve come around to it who have</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.760" end="00:28:08.440" style="s2">partially come around to it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.550" end="00:28:10.660" style="s2">sense the tech has a bad conscience it</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.440" end="00:28:13.420" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s not in delivering the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.660" end="00:28:15.460" style="s2">promises you know Google had this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.420" end="00:28:17.080" style="s2">propaganda about the future and it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.460" end="00:28:18.730" style="s2">seen as you know the self-driving cars</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.080" end="00:28:20.620" style="s2">are further away than people expected</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.730" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">and so I think I think there is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.620" end="00:28:25.390" style="s2">a sense that things have shifted a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:28.450" style="s2">over the last decade but even like five</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.390" end="00:28:32.590" style="s2">years ago I mean if it feels to me I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.450" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">moved out to work with you in 2013 I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.590" end="00:28:35.380" style="s2">never seen a boom before I mean this was</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">one of the things that was really</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.380" end="00:28:40.420" style="s2">important to me is that being in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:44.800" style="s2">academics the Academy had been in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.420" end="00:28:48.520" style="s2">depression since this change around 1970</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.800" end="00:28:51.250" style="s2">to 73 and seeing a boom and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.520" end="00:28:53.980" style="s2">people with like flowers and dollar</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.250" end="00:28:55.980" style="s2">signs in their eyes you know talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.980" end="00:28:57.690" style="s2">about a world of abundance and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.980" end="00:28:59.789" style="s2">how everything was gonna be great it</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.690" end="00:29:04.049" style="s2">seemed like everybody was the CEO or CTO</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.789" end="00:29:07.169" style="s2">of some tiny company and then very very</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.049" end="00:29:08.700" style="s2">quickly it all started to change it I</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.169" end="00:29:11.309" style="s2">felt like a lot of people moved back</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.700" end="00:29:13.740" style="s2">into the behemoths from their little</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.309" end="00:29:16.019" style="s2">startup having failed a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.740" end="00:29:17.519" style="s2">ideology felt poisonous like don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.019" end="00:29:19.860" style="s2">evil was not even something you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.519" end="00:29:21.570" style="s2">utter without somebody snickering behind</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.860" end="00:29:23.730" style="s2">your back there&#39;s like a self-hating</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.570" end="00:29:26.970" style="s2">component where the engineers have been</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.730" end="00:29:29.220" style="s2">recruited ideologically and are like not</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.970" end="00:29:31.110" style="s2">actually there to do business how did</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.220" end="00:29:33.269" style="s2">this happen so quickly well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.110" end="00:29:34.889" style="s2">always its am I wrong about that no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.269" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">it&#39;s striking how fast it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.889" end="00:29:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s striking how much it&#39;s happened in</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:41.539" style="s2">the context of a bull market so if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:44.730" style="s2">describe this in terms of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.539" end="00:29:46.440" style="s2">you&#39;d think that people people be as</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.730" end="00:29:49.409" style="s2">angry in Silicon Valley as they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.440" end="00:29:51.330" style="s2">today the stock market must be down 40</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.409" end="00:29:53.250" style="s2">or 50 percent it&#39;s like you know people</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.330" end="00:29:55.049" style="s2">in New York City were angry in 2009 they</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.250" end="00:29:57.149" style="s2">were angry at the bank&#39;s they hated</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.049" end="00:29:59.610" style="s2">themselves but you know the stock market</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.149" end="00:30:02.549" style="s2">was down 50 60 percent the banks had</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.610" end="00:30:05.330" style="s2">gotten obliterated and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.549" end="00:30:08.039" style="s2">makes sense psychologically and and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.330" end="00:30:09.419" style="s2">strange thing is that on a in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.039" end="00:30:11.309" style="s2">the serve law the macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.419" end="00:30:13.799" style="s2">indicators the stock markets the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.309" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">valuations of the larger companies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.799" end="00:30:20.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like way beyond the dot-com peaks</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:24.269" style="s2">of 2000 and in all sorts of ways but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.220" end="00:30:26.789" style="s2">mood is not like late 99 early 2000 it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.269" end="00:30:28.610" style="s2">has this very different mood and and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.789" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">way I would would explain this is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.610" end="00:30:33.620" style="s2">for the people involved it is sort of a</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.620" end="00:30:37.620" style="s2">yes this is where where things are but</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.059" end="00:30:39.809" style="s2">are they gonna be worth a lot more in</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.620" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">five years ten years and that&#39;s gotten</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.809" end="00:30:45.510" style="s2">that&#39;s gotten a lot harder to tell and</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:47.460" style="s2">so there&#39;s been growth but people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.510" end="00:30:49.139" style="s2">unhappy and frustrated because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.460" end="00:30:52.139" style="s2">don&#39;t see that much growth going forward</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.139" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">even within tech even within this world</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.139" end="00:30:56.850" style="s2">of of bets which had been you know very</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:30:59.789" style="s2">very decoupled for for such a long time</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.850" end="00:31:02.669" style="s2">now one of the things that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.789" end="00:31:04.620" style="s2">to me is is that when we talk like this</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.669" end="00:31:06.870" style="s2">a lot of people are gonna say wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.620" end="00:31:09.860" style="s2">a lot of gloom and doom so much is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.870" end="00:31:13.190" style="s2">changing so much is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.860" end="00:31:16.610" style="s2">and yet what I sense is is that both you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.190" end="00:31:19.130" style="s2">and I have an idea that we&#39;ve lived our</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.610" end="00:31:22.549" style="s2">entire life in some sort of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.130" end="00:31:26.030" style="s2">Truman Show where everything is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.549" end="00:31:26.900" style="s2">fake and something super exciting is</p>

<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:36.679" style="s2">telling that well I think that I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.860" end="00:31:38.630" style="s2">there&#39;s been the potential to get back</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.679" end="00:31:38.990" style="s2">to the future for a long time and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.730" end="00:31:45.049" style="s2">Show at various points there was a big</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.590" end="00:31:48.830" style="s2">break with 9/11 there was a big break</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.049" end="00:31:50.270" style="s2">with the 2080 browsers um you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.830" end="00:31:52.970" style="s2">could say there&#39;s some sort of break</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.270" end="00:31:54.679" style="s2">with Trebek Siddhant Trump and in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.970" end="00:31:55.940" style="s2">last few years it&#39;s still like a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.679" end="00:31:59.090" style="s2">bit undecided with it what that all</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.940" end="00:32:01.400" style="s2">means but I think I think there were a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.090" end="00:32:03.740" style="s2">lot of reasons to to question this and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.400" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">reassess this for some time the three</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.740" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">assessments never quite happened but but</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:10.220" style="s2">I would say I think we&#39;re now at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:13.429" style="s2">point where where this is is really</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.220" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">gonna happen in the next you know um you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.429" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">know two years to five years to two</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">decade I don&#39;t think The Truman Show can</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.820" end="00:32:46.940" style="s2">insanity that we saw in the dot-com</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.710" end="00:32:49.100" style="s2">years will never come back in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.940" end="00:32:51.140" style="s2">lifetimes of the people here because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.100" end="00:32:52.490" style="s2">know it&#39;s psychologically you can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.140" end="00:32:54.470" style="s2">that crazy again while you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.490" end="00:32:56.330" style="s2">alive right the 1920s didn&#39;t come back</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.470" end="00:32:59.179" style="s2">till the less maybe the 1980s or</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.330" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">something long generationally yeah was</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.179" end="00:33:05.299" style="s2">over and yet already in 2001 we had the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.940" end="00:33:07.940" style="s2">incipient housing bubble and and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.299" end="00:33:10.940" style="s2">some other shows kept going for for it</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.940" end="00:33:12.740" style="s2">for 20 years with the narrative like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.940" end="00:33:13.520" style="s2">whole narrative behind the Great</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.520" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">I mean I remember just like clutching my</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.669" end="00:33:20.900" style="s2">head how can you tell a story that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:23.809" style="s2">banished volatility</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.900" end="00:33:26.420" style="s2">yes it&#39;s always I always think of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.809" end="00:33:30.260" style="s2">1990s narrative was the new economy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.420" end="00:33:33.710" style="s2">you lied about growth and then the 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.260" end="00:33:36.559" style="s2">narrative was the Great Moderation</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.710" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">and you lied about volatility and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.559" end="00:33:42.830" style="s2">maybe you know there&#39;s sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:44.450" style="s2">2010s one is a secular stagnation where</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.830" end="00:33:45.890" style="s2">you lie about the the real interest</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.450" end="00:33:47.900" style="s2">rates because the other two don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.890" end="00:33:51.110" style="s2">anymore and sort of a complicated way</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.900" end="00:33:53.090" style="s2">these things connect but but yes new</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.110" end="00:33:54.530" style="s2">economy sounded very bullish in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.090" end="00:33:57.590" style="s2">Great Moderation</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.530" end="00:33:59.690" style="s2">was still a reason belong stocks but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.590" end="00:34:01.940" style="s2">sounds less bullish and then secular</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.690" end="00:34:03.429" style="s2">stagnation in the Larry Summers forms to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.940" end="00:34:06.290" style="s2">be specific what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.429" end="00:34:07.670" style="s2">means again that you should be long the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.290" end="00:34:09.770" style="s2">stock market the stock market&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.670" end="00:34:11.270" style="s2">keep going up because things are so</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.770" end="00:34:14.540" style="s2">stagnant the real rates will stay low</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.270" end="00:34:15.980" style="s2">forever so so they are equally bullish</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.540" end="00:34:19.909" style="s2">narratives although they sound less</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.980" end="00:34:23.389" style="s2">bullish over time so that effectively we</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.909" end="00:34:26.120" style="s2">needed what happened with the roaring</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.389" end="00:34:28.220" style="s2">20s followed by the depression was that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.120" end="00:34:30.770" style="s2">there was a general skepticism and here</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.220" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">the septa sysm seems to be specific to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.770" end="00:34:35.240" style="s2">something different in each incarnation</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:38.090" style="s2">that view it you keep having bubbles</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.240" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">with some lie you have yet to tell yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.090" end="00:34:43.610" style="s2">but I think and of course I think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:45.649" style="s2">the crazy cut on the 20s and 30s was</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.610" end="00:34:46.970" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t need to have as big of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.649" end="00:34:49.460" style="s2">crash you could you could have probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.970" end="00:34:52.730" style="s2">done all sorts of intervention because</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.460" end="00:34:54.760" style="s2">the 1930s was still a period that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.730" end="00:34:57.080" style="s2">very healthy in terms of background</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.760" end="00:34:59.090" style="s2">scientific technological innovation if</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.080" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">we just rattle off what was discovered</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.090" end="00:35:03.560" style="s2">in the 1930s that had real-world</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:06.050" style="s2">practical things was the aviation</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.560" end="00:35:09.770" style="s2">industry got off the ground the talkies</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.050" end="00:35:11.860" style="s2">the movies got a got going you had you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.770" end="00:35:14.210" style="s2">had the plastics industry you had the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.860" end="00:35:16.580" style="s2">you know you had secondary oil recovery</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.210" end="00:35:19.790" style="s2">you had household appliances got</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.580" end="00:35:21.020" style="s2">developed and an ziyan by 1939 there</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.790" end="00:35:24.710" style="s2">were three times as many people who had</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.020" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">cars in the US as in 1929 and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.710" end="00:35:29.000" style="s2">there was this crazy tailwind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:32.120" style="s2">scientific and technological progress</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.000" end="00:35:34.530" style="s2">that then somehow got you know badly</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.120" end="00:35:37.260" style="s2">mismanaged financially by you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.530" end="00:35:38.700" style="s2">whoever you blame the crash on huh and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.260" end="00:35:41.490" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s what actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.700" end="00:35:43.110" style="s2">happened in the 30s and then and then we</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.490" end="00:35:45.870" style="s2">tried to sort of manage all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.110" end="00:35:48.750" style="s2">financial indicators much more precisely</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.870" end="00:35:52.020" style="s2">in recent decades even though the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.750" end="00:35:55.380" style="s2">tailwind wasn&#39;t there at all so let me</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.020" end="00:35:57.420" style="s2">focus you on two subjects that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.380" end="00:36:01.700" style="s2">important for trying to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.420" end="00:36:05.370" style="s2">economy going forward I&#39;m very fond of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.700" end="00:36:07.590" style="s2">perhaps over claiming but making a</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.370" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">strong claim for physics that physics</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.590" end="00:36:13.050" style="s2">gave us atomic devices in a nuclear</p>

<p begin="00:36:13.050" end="00:36:18.950" style="s2">definitively it gave us the</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.740" end="00:36:37.530" style="s2">underrated as powering the world economy</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.080" end="00:36:39.270" style="s2">on the other hand it&#39;s very strange to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.530" end="00:36:42.270" style="s2">me that we had the three-dimensional</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.000" end="00:37:08.580" style="s2">what I would have imagined for physics</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.030" end="00:37:10.530" style="s2">so it feels like somehow we&#39;re in a new</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.580" end="00:37:12.180" style="s2">orchard and we&#39;re spending a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.530" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">exploring it but we haven&#39;t found the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.180" end="00:37:17.580" style="s2">low-hanging fruit in biology and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:20.220" style="s2">kind of exhausted the physics orchard</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.580" end="00:37:22.020" style="s2">because what we found is so exotic that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.220" end="00:37:24.570" style="s2">it you know whether it&#39;s two black holes</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.020" end="00:37:27.870" style="s2">colliding or you know a third generation</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.570" end="00:37:29.430" style="s2">of matter or quark substructure we</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.870" end="00:37:33.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to use these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.430" end="00:37:35.670" style="s2">are we somehow between revolutions well</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.960" end="00:37:38.460" style="s2">I think I would say the question of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.670" end="00:37:40.290" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and but I&#39;m I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.460" end="00:37:42.120" style="s2">bet I wouldn&#39;t I&#39;d be pessimistic on</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.290" end="00:37:45.650" style="s2">physics generally so that&#39;s sort of B</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.120" end="00:37:47.700" style="s2">he&#39;s my bias on that one biology I</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.650" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">continue to think we could be doing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.700" end="00:37:51.990" style="s2">lot more we</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:53.550" style="s2">be making a lot more progress and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.990" end="00:37:55.080" style="s2">know the pessimistic version is that no</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.550" end="00:37:58.020" style="s2">biology is just semis much harder than</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.080" end="00:38:00.270" style="s2">physics and therefore therefore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.020" end="00:38:02.130" style="s2">been slower going the the more</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.270" end="00:38:03.780" style="s2">optimistic one is that though the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.130" end="00:38:05.910" style="s2">culture is just broken we have we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.780" end="00:38:08.040" style="s2">very talented people go into physics you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.910" end="00:38:09.330" style="s2">go into biology if you&#39;re if you&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.040" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">talented you know it&#39;s sort of like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.330" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">you can sort of think of it as Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:14.940" style="s2">terms you you can think of biology as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:17.490" style="s2">selection for people with bad math genes</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.940" end="00:38:19.290" style="s2">and if you&#39;re good at math you go into</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.490" end="00:38:22.380" style="s2">physics go to math or physics or at</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.290" end="00:38:24.690" style="s2">least chemistry and and biology we sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.380" end="00:38:26.730" style="s2">of selected for um you know all of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.690" end="00:38:28.619" style="s2">people who were somewhat somewhat less</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.730" end="00:38:31.080" style="s2">talented so that might be there might be</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.619" end="00:38:33.210" style="s2">a cultural explanation for for why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.080" end="00:38:35.430" style="s2">been been slower progress but I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:39.570" style="s2">had people from physics we had like</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.430" end="00:38:43.350" style="s2">teller and Fineman and Crick there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.570" end="00:38:46.080" style="s2">shortage of I mean you know to my</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.350" end="00:38:50.190" style="s2">earlier point molecular biology anyway</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.080" end="00:38:51.810" style="s2">was really founded by physicists more</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.190" end="00:38:56.760" style="s2">than it more than any other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.810" end="00:39:00.180" style="s2">think why is it that in an era where</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.760" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">physics is stagnating we don&#39;t see these</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.180" end="00:39:04.830" style="s2">kind of minds like I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:09.030" style="s2">skeptical that that theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.830" end="00:39:10.590" style="s2">well III I&#39;m not I&#39;m not so sure like if</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.030" end="00:39:13.140" style="s2">you you know if you&#39;re a string theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.590" end="00:39:16.890" style="s2">person or even sort of an applied</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.140" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">experimental physicist I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.890" end="00:39:20.130" style="s2">can that easily reboot into biology I</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.900" style="s2">mean these the you know these</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.130" end="00:39:25.320" style="s2">disciplines have gotten sort of more um</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.900" end="00:39:27.330" style="s2">more rigid it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.320" end="00:39:29.340" style="s2">to transfer from one area to another i</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.330" end="00:39:31.140" style="s2">had you know i when i was an</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.340" end="00:39:32.850" style="s2">undergraduate you still had some you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.140" end="00:39:34.680" style="s2">know older professors who were polymaths</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.850" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">who knew a lot about a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.680" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">things Rises this is I think the way one</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">should really think of you know Watson</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:42.840" style="s2">and Crick or fine men or you know or</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:45.030" style="s2">tell her they they you know they they</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.840" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">were certainly world class and in in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.030" end="00:39:51.240" style="s2">their field but also like incredible in</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:53.000" style="s2">the water fairly aggressive and and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.240" end="00:39:55.350" style="s2">you know the the cultural or</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.000" end="00:39:57.990" style="s2">institutional rule is no polymaths</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.350" end="00:40:00.690" style="s2">allowed you know you could you can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.990" end="00:40:02.970" style="s2">you can be narrowly specialized yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.690" end="00:40:04.740" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested in other things you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.970" end="00:40:06.930" style="s2">better keep it to yourself and not tell</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.740" end="00:40:08.580" style="s2">people because if you say that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.930" end="00:40:11.310" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in computer science</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.580" end="00:40:14.100" style="s2">and also music or studying the hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.310" end="00:40:16.170" style="s2">bible wow that&#39;s uh that&#39;s that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.100" end="00:40:18.810" style="s2">uh that must mean you&#39;re just not very</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.170" end="00:40:20.820" style="s2">serious about computer science well so i</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.810" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">totally want to riff on on this point</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.820" end="00:40:26.040" style="s2">because i think you&#39;ve hit the nail on</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:27.780" style="s2">the head to my way of thinking the key</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.040" end="00:40:30.270" style="s2">problem is if you go back to our</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.780" end="00:40:31.830" style="s2">original contention which is is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.270" end="00:40:34.500" style="s2">there is something universally</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.830" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">pathological about the stories that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.500" end="00:40:39.900" style="s2">every institution predicated on growth</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:42.270" style="s2">has to tell about itself when things are</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.900" end="00:40:43.619" style="s2">not growing the biggest danger is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.270" end="00:40:46.260" style="s2">somebody smart</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.619" end="00:40:48.210" style="s2">inside of the institution will start</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.260" end="00:40:51.600" style="s2">questioning things and speaking openly</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.210" end="00:40:53.880" style="s2">and it seems like the blue mouse would</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.600" end="00:40:55.800" style="s2">be the people who could connect the dots</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.880" end="00:40:57.150" style="s2">and say you know there&#39;s not that much</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.800" end="00:40:58.530" style="s2">going on in my department there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.150" end="00:40:59.550" style="s2">much going on this department over here</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.530" end="00:41:01.260" style="s2">not that much going on in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.550" end="00:41:03.030" style="s2">department over there and those people</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.260" end="00:41:06.210" style="s2">are very very dangerous you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.030" end="00:41:08.430" style="s2">my one of my friends uh studied physics</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.210" end="00:41:10.950" style="s2">at stanford in the late 90s um his</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.430" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">advisor was this professor at stanford</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.950" end="00:41:15.359" style="s2">bob Laughlin who in the late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:17.250" style="s2">brilliant physics guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:20.820" style="s2">late nineties he gets the Nobel Prize in</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.250" end="00:41:22.770" style="s2">Physics and he suffers from the supreme</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.820" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">delusion that now that he has a Nobel</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.770" end="00:41:27.210" style="s2">Prize he has total academic freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:29.850" style="s2">he can do anything he wants to and he</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.210" end="00:41:30.780" style="s2">decided to direct it at you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.850" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">they&#39;re all these areas you should</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.780" end="00:41:34.859" style="s2">probably shouldn&#39;t go into each position</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:35.940" style="s2">question climate science they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.859" end="00:41:38.070" style="s2">these things when one should be careful</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.940" end="00:41:39.869" style="s2">about but he went into an area far more</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.070" end="00:41:40.950" style="s2">dangerous than all of those he was</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.869" end="00:41:44.700" style="s2">convinced that there were all these</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.180" end="00:46:02.250" style="s2">so so you know this is and I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.030" end="00:46:05.220" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not that</p>

<p begin="00:46:11.820" end="00:46:15.750" style="s2">of our society right there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.580" end="00:46:19.770" style="s2">which we have almost no left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.750" end="00:46:23.640" style="s2">professors right in this key still is</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.770" end="00:46:26.250" style="s2">still there as sort of a last remnant of</p>

<p begin="00:46:29.130" end="00:46:33.180" style="s2">part of right and there may be some that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.710" end="00:46:35.670" style="s2">are you know much older so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.180" end="00:46:37.200" style="s2">maybe in your 80s we can you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.670" end="00:46:38.220" style="s2">pretend to ignore you or you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:41.850" style="s2">just what happens to people in their 80s</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.220" end="00:46:44.130" style="s2">sure and but but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.850" end="00:46:47.190" style="s2">you know younger professors in there say</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.130" end="00:46:48.510" style="s2">40s who are deeply critical of the of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.190" end="00:46:52.140" style="s2">the university structure I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.510" end="00:46:53.550" style="s2">just it&#39;s just not you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.140" end="00:46:56.040" style="s2">have that it&#39;s like again if you come</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.550" end="00:46:58.770" style="s2">back to something as um as reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.040" end="00:47:00.920" style="s2">as the ever-escalating student debt</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.770" end="00:47:03.390" style="s2">right you know the bigger the debt gets</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.920" end="00:47:03.930" style="s2">you can sort of think what is the 1.6</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.390" end="00:47:06.360" style="s2">trillion</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.930" end="00:47:08.340" style="s2">what does it pay for and in a sense it</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.360" end="00:47:10.080" style="s2">pays for 1.6 trillion dollars worth of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.340" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">lies about how great the system is and</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.080" end="00:47:15.120" style="s2">so the more of the debt goes the crazier</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.190" style="s2">the system gets but also the more you</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.120" end="00:47:19.080" style="s2">have to tell the lies and these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.190" end="00:47:22.010" style="s2">sort of go together no it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.080" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">stable sequence at some rate this breaks</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.010" end="00:47:25.980" style="s2">you know again I would I would bet on</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:28.020" style="s2">you know a decade not a century well</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.980" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">that this is the fascinating thing you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.020" end="00:47:34.650" style="s2">of course famously started the teal</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:37.710" style="s2">fellowship as a program which correct me</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.650" end="00:47:40.320" style="s2">if I&#39;m wrong on this 2005 is when</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.710" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">student debt became non dischargeable in</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.320" end="00:47:45.900" style="s2">bankruptcy 43 bankruptcy revision right</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">now that yes is so if you if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.900" end="00:47:49.500" style="s2">pay off your student loans on when</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:51.420" style="s2">you&#39;re 65 the government will garnish</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.500" end="00:47:54.270" style="s2">your social security wages to to pay off</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.420" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">your student debt right this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.270" end="00:47:59.610" style="s2">amazing that this existed in a modern</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:48:03.090" style="s2">society and of course well so let me ask</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.610" end="00:48:04.980" style="s2">am i right that you were attacking what</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.090" end="00:48:07.350" style="s2">was necessary to keep the college</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.980" end="00:48:11.250" style="s2">mythology going and you were afraid and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.350" end="00:48:17.670" style="s2">that College might be enervating some of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.250" end="00:48:19.470" style="s2">our sort of most dynamic minds um well I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.670" end="00:48:20.970" style="s2">think I think there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.470" end="00:48:22.860" style="s2">critiques when you want your half of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.970" end="00:48:26.130" style="s2">universities I think the debt one is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.860" end="00:48:31.650" style="s2">is a very simple very simple one it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.130" end="00:48:34.380" style="s2">its it&#39;s always dangerous to be burdened</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.650" end="00:48:37.350" style="s2">with too much debt it&#39;s for does limit</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.380" end="00:48:39.960" style="s2">your your freedom of action and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.350" end="00:48:42.210" style="s2">especially pernicious to do this super</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.960" end="00:48:46.140" style="s2">early in your career and so if you if</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.210" end="00:48:47.340" style="s2">out of the gate you owe $100,000 and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.140" end="00:48:49.710" style="s2">know it&#39;s never clear you can get out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.340" end="00:48:51.450" style="s2">that hole that&#39;s um that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.710" end="00:48:53.880" style="s2">either demotivate you or it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.450" end="00:48:55.260" style="s2">push you into into maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.880" end="00:48:58.710" style="s2">slightly higher paying</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.260" end="00:49:01.079" style="s2">very uncreated professions of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.710" end="00:49:02.790" style="s2">that are probably you know less good at</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.079" end="00:49:05.369" style="s2">moving our whole society forwards and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.790" end="00:49:06.900" style="s2">I I think yes I think I think the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.369" end="00:49:11.030" style="s2">thing is is is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.900" end="00:49:14.040" style="s2">pernicious so and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.030" end="00:49:15.420" style="s2">it was one of these things where I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.040" end="00:49:20.910" style="s2">know and I started talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.420" end="00:49:24.390" style="s2">back in um back in 2010 at mm mm um it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.910" end="00:49:27.000" style="s2">was already it was already like it it</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.390" end="00:49:28.380" style="s2">was controversial but it was not like</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.000" end="00:49:30.780" style="s2">you know younger people all agreed with</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.380" end="00:49:32.430" style="s2">me the younger people younger they you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.780" end="00:49:34.859" style="s2">know and and and it&#39;s a decade later</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.430" end="00:49:38.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot crazier it hasn&#39;t you know we</p>

<p begin="00:50:19.950" end="00:50:24.690" style="s2">interesting if you imagine that the baby</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:53.010" style="s2">uh mostly these things people you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.540" end="00:51:54.720" style="s2">yeah that we had sort of somewhat</p>

<p begin="00:52:04.650" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">make that much that much sense um but</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.490" end="00:52:12.839" style="s2">but yes I look I think I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.980" end="00:52:15.030" style="s2">the reasons are one of the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.839" end="00:52:18.839" style="s2">and right on our side this is people</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.030" end="00:52:20.069" style="s2">more self-critical here on on on this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.839" end="00:52:21.480" style="s2">that the question we always are</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.069" end="00:52:23.790" style="s2">confirmed with well what is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.480" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">alternative how do you actually do</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.790" end="00:52:30.420" style="s2">something and um and it is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">not obvious what the individual</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.420" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">alternatives are on an individual level</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:37.800" style="s2">if you get into a elite university it</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:38.849" style="s2">probably still makes sense to go you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.800" end="00:52:41.369" style="s2">know probably isn&#39;t make sense to go to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.849" end="00:52:43.950" style="s2">number 100 or something like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.369" end="00:52:46.140" style="s2">I think but but so there is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.950" end="00:52:47.790" style="s2">way can still work individually even if</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.140" end="00:52:48.510" style="s2">it does not work you know for our</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.790" end="00:52:50.760" style="s2">country as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.510" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">um and and and so there are sort of all</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.760" end="00:52:56.849" style="s2">these all these challenges in in in in</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:59.220" style="s2">an in you know coming up with alternate</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.849" end="00:53:00.839" style="s2">tracks like I think I think in software</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.220" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s some degree to which people are</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.839" end="00:53:04.560" style="s2">be hired if they&#39;re just good at coding</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:06.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s not quite as critical if they</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.560" end="00:53:08.760" style="s2">have a computer science degree ok can we</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.780" end="00:53:11.430" style="s2">do this in other other careers other</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.760" end="00:53:13.619" style="s2">fields on I would ten thing one could</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.430" end="00:53:16.290" style="s2">it&#39;s been it&#39;s been slow to happen well</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.619" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2">so you and I have been excited about a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.290" end="00:53:19.800" style="s2">great number of things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:21.660" style="s2">taking place outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.800" end="00:53:23.539" style="s2">institutional system</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.660" end="00:53:25.829" style="s2">but one of the things that I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.539" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">continuing continue to be mystified by</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.829" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">is that we are somewhat politically</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:32.579" style="s2">divided where you are well known as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:36.599" style="s2">conservative and I really come from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.579" end="00:53:38.970" style="s2">fairly radical progressive streak so we</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.599" end="00:53:40.589" style="s2">have this common view of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.970" end="00:53:42.690" style="s2">problems but sometimes we come to very</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.589" end="00:53:45.059" style="s2">different ideas about how those problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.690" end="00:53:47.789" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be saw do you want to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.059" end="00:53:50.400" style="s2">just try riffing or figuring out like</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.789" end="00:53:52.109" style="s2">assume that we somehow found ourselves a</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.400" end="00:53:54.420" style="s2">position of some some degree of power</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.109" end="00:53:56.700" style="s2">with an ability to direct a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.420" end="00:54:01.140" style="s2">more than we have currently what would</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.700" end="00:54:02.730" style="s2">you do to create the preconditions so</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.140" end="00:54:05.579" style="s2">not necessarily picking particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.730" end="00:54:07.289" style="s2">projects but what would you try to do to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.579" end="00:54:10.529" style="s2">create the preconditions where people</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.289" end="00:54:12.210" style="s2">are really dreaming about futures both</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.529" end="00:54:15.890" style="s2">at a technological level family</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.210" end="00:54:18.450" style="s2">formation making our civil society</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.890" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">healthier what where would you where</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.450" end="00:54:25.259" style="s2">would you start to work first well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:26.430" style="s2">there there&#39;s a lot of things that so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.259" end="00:54:27.779" style="s2">always I&#39;m always a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.430" end="00:54:29.220" style="s2">uncomfortable this sort of question</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.779" end="00:54:33.089" style="s2">because you can talk about me too</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.220" end="00:54:34.650" style="s2">because um you know I feel like uh you</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.089" end="00:54:36.539" style="s2">know we&#39;re not going to be dictators of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.650" end="00:54:37.769" style="s2">the United States and then you know all</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.539" end="00:54:42.150" style="s2">sorts of things you could do for your</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.769" end="00:54:44.519" style="s2">dictators if um but but certainly on</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.150" end="00:54:45.869" style="s2">look I would I would I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.519" end="00:54:48.750" style="s2">look at the college debt thing very</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.869" end="00:54:51.180" style="s2">seriously I would say that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.750" end="00:54:56.819" style="s2">dischargeable in bankruptcy and if and</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.180" end="00:54:59.430" style="s2">if and if if if people um go bankrupt</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.819" end="00:55:01.589" style="s2">and part of the debt has to be paid for</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.430" end="00:55:02.460" style="s2">by the university that that did it there</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.589" end="00:55:04.230" style="s2">has to be some sort of local</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.460" end="00:55:06.089" style="s2">accountability so this would love that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.230" end="00:55:07.950" style="s2">that would be sort of a more right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.089" end="00:55:09.960" style="s2">answer the left-wing answers we should</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.950" end="00:55:11.759" style="s2">know socialize the debt in some ways and</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.960" end="00:55:12.809" style="s2">the universities should never pay for</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.759" end="00:55:16.829" style="s2">that which would be more the you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.809" end="00:55:20.579" style="s2">Sanders warrant approach but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.829" end="00:55:24.089" style="s2">but there&#39;ll be one version I think you</p>

<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:21.749" style="s2">degree where you can prove that you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.559" end="00:56:24.869" style="s2">a level of knowledge that would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.749" end="00:56:27.599" style="s2">equivalent let&#39;s say to a graduating</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.869" end="00:56:30.239" style="s2">Harvard chemistry major right or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.599" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">fraction thereof where you have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.239" end="00:56:35.339" style="s2">ability to prove that through some sort</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.339" end="00:56:39.150" style="s2">you create an I love it yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.739" end="00:56:40.499" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to implement again I</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.150" end="00:56:42.029" style="s2">think I think these things are hard to</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.499" end="00:56:45.239" style="s2">do well again about great idea there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.029" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">possibility of we have all these people</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.239" end="00:56:49.499" style="s2">who have something like Stockholm</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.499" end="00:56:54.449" style="s2">if you if you&#39;ve got a Harvard chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.170" end="00:56:57.119" style="s2">degree right and if you suspect that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.449" end="00:56:59.459" style="s2">know actually the knowledge could be had</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.119" end="00:57:01.589" style="s2">by a lot of people and if it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.459" end="00:57:03.569" style="s2">set of tests you have to pass um that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.589" end="00:57:07.289" style="s2">your degree would be a lot less special</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.569" end="00:57:10.199" style="s2">you will resist this very very hard you</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.289" end="00:57:14.579" style="s2">know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re in an um in an</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.199" end="00:57:17.099" style="s2">HR department or in a company hiring</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.579" end="00:57:19.709" style="s2">people you will want to hire people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.099" end="00:57:21.900" style="s2">went to a good college because you went</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.709" end="00:57:23.519" style="s2">to a good college and if we broaden the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.900" end="00:57:25.529" style="s2">hiring and so we&#39;re gonna hire all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.519" end="00:57:27.150" style="s2">of people maybe maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.529" end="00:57:28.920" style="s2">self-defeating four out for your own</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.150" end="00:57:30.299" style="s2">positions I think I think there are you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.920" end="00:57:32.489" style="s2">know I think one should not</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.299" end="00:57:34.559" style="s2">underestimate how many people you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.489" end="00:57:37.230" style="s2">have have a form of Stockholm Syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:40.680" style="s2">here so some other</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.230" end="00:57:42.119" style="s2">ideas at some point when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.680" end="00:57:44.340" style="s2">about and I should have said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.119" end="00:57:46.530" style="s2">that the teal fellowship for those who</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.340" end="00:57:50.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know is a program that has</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.530" end="00:57:51.780" style="s2">historically at least began paying very</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.070" end="00:57:54.390" style="s2">young people who&#39;d been admitted to</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.780" end="00:57:56.580" style="s2">colleges to drop out of those colleges</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.390" end="00:57:59.130" style="s2">so they got to keep the idea that they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.580" end="00:58:01.320" style="s2">been admitted to some fairly prestigious</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.130" end="00:58:03.420" style="s2">place but then they were given money to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.320" end="00:58:05.580" style="s2">actually live their dreams and not put</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.420" end="00:58:07.859" style="s2">them on yes it was it was it has been an</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.580" end="00:58:11.310" style="s2">extremely successful and effective</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.859" end="00:58:13.710" style="s2">program it&#39;s not scalable right so so we</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.310" end="00:58:15.840" style="s2">had a hack the um we had a hack the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.710" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">prestige status thing where it was as</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.840" end="00:58:21.780" style="s2">hard or harder to get a teal fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:24.119" style="s2">than to get into a top university Randa</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.780" end="00:58:26.430" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s part that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.119" end="00:58:30.060" style="s2">very hard to scale well so when I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.430" end="00:58:33.300" style="s2">looking at that program for you one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.060" end="00:58:36.390" style="s2">the things that I floated was the idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.300" end="00:58:44.460" style="s2">that if you look at every advanced</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.390" end="00:58:46.980" style="s2">degree like a a JD or an MD PhD none of</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.460" end="00:58:48.930" style="s2">them seem to carry the requirement of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.980" end="00:58:53.160" style="s2">having a BA which is quite mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.930" end="00:58:55.140" style="s2">and if you fail to get a PhD let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.160" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s usually an embedded master&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.140" end="00:59:00.060" style="s2">degree that you get is a going-away</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:03.630" style="s2">present and therefore if you could get</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.060" end="00:59:05.550" style="s2">people to skip college if you give them</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.630" end="00:59:08.760" style="s2">perhaps four years of their lives back</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.550" end="00:59:10.530" style="s2">and you could use the first year of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.760" end="00:59:12.600" style="s2">graduate school which is very often kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.530" end="00:59:14.460" style="s2">of a rapid recapitulation of what</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.600" end="00:59:16.619" style="s2">undergraduate was everybody&#39;s a level</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.460" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">playing field and then it worse comes to</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.619" end="00:59:19.890" style="s2">worse people would leave as a mass with</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:23.130" style="s2">a masters they would in general get a</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.890" end="00:59:26.040" style="s2">stipend because a lot of the tuition is</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.130" end="00:59:28.619" style="s2">remitted to them in graduate programs is</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.040" end="00:59:33.230" style="s2">that a viable program to get some group</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.619" end="00:59:36.359" style="s2">of people who are highly motivated to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.230" end="00:59:38.130" style="s2">avoid the BA entirely is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.359" end="00:59:43.800" style="s2">administrators degree rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.130" end="00:59:45.359" style="s2">professor&#39;s degree um let me see I yes I</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.800" end="00:59:46.500" style="s2">mean all these different subtle</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.359" end="00:59:48.750" style="s2">critiques I can have our disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.500" end="00:59:50.970" style="s2">but yeah I think look I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.750" end="00:59:52.589" style="s2">the BA is not as valuable as it looks</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.970" end="00:59:55.260" style="s2">I also think the PhD is not as valuable</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.589" end="00:59:57.450" style="s2">as it looks I sort of feel it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.260" end="01:00:00.329" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.450" end="01:00:01.589" style="s2">across the board it strikes me that what</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.329" end="01:00:05.039" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing is a bit of an uphill</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.589" end="01:00:07.619" style="s2">struggle because um at the top</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.039" end="01:00:10.140" style="s2">universities the BA is the far more</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.619" end="01:00:12.180" style="s2">prestigious degree than a PhD at this</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.140" end="01:00:14.579" style="s2">point so if you&#39;re at Stanford or</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.180" end="01:00:18.380" style="s2">Harvard you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.579" end="01:00:21.150" style="s2">hard to get in to the undergraduate and</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.380" end="01:00:23.549" style="s2">then you have you have more PhD students</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.150" end="01:00:27.270" style="s2">then you have undergraduates there all</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.549" end="01:00:28.619" style="s2">these people who are on you know a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.270" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">questionable track they&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.619" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">questionable choices it&#39;s not clear you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:37.770" style="s2">know you know and so if you sort of and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:39.059" style="s2">and and and they&#39;re probably probably</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.770" end="01:00:42.180" style="s2">are gonna have some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.059" end="01:00:43.890" style="s2">psychological breakdown in their future</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.180" end="01:00:46.859" style="s2">you know the dating prospects aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.890" end="01:00:48.660" style="s2">good there all these things that are a</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.859" end="01:00:52.109" style="s2">little bit off so yet in theory if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.660" end="01:00:53.789" style="s2">had a super tightly controlled ph.d</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.109" end="01:00:55.289" style="s2">program right that might work</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.789" end="01:00:58.200" style="s2">but but you have to at least make those</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.289" end="01:01:00.510" style="s2">those two changes you know as it is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.200" end="01:01:03.270" style="s2">people in in graduate school it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.510" end="01:01:04.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like tribbles and Star Trek and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.270" end="01:01:07.529" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it there&#39;s you know we</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.680" end="01:01:12.180" style="s2">have you know just so many and they all</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.529" end="01:01:15.150" style="s2">feel expendable and unneeded and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.180" end="01:01:16.890" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s just that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.150" end="01:01:20.039" style="s2">a good that&#39;s not a good place to be you</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.890" end="01:01:21.690" style="s2">know and and where&#39;s I think the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.039" end="01:01:23.880" style="s2">undergraduate conceit is still that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.690" end="01:01:25.829" style="s2">more you know k-selected instead of our</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.880" end="01:01:27.779" style="s2">selector that it&#39;s more on that</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.829" end="01:01:29.400" style="s2">everybody is special and valuable you</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.779" end="01:01:32.460" style="s2">know that&#39;s often not true either</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.400" end="01:01:36.329" style="s2">so I&#39;d be critical of both right and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.460" end="01:01:38.819" style="s2">I think but yeah if we if we could if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.329" end="01:01:40.980" style="s2">could have a real PhD that was required</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.819" end="01:01:43.289" style="s2">you know there was was much harder and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.980" end="01:01:46.109" style="s2">that actually led to sort of an academic</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.289" end="01:01:47.940" style="s2">position or some other comparable</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.109" end="01:01:49.559" style="s2">position that would be that&#39;d be good</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.940" end="01:01:51.180" style="s2">you know one of the questions I always</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.559" end="01:01:53.279" style="s2">come back to and this is what is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.180" end="01:01:56.400" style="s2">teleology these programs where do they</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.279" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">where do they go and and what I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.400" end="01:02:02.250" style="s2">has gone you know um and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:03.690" style="s2">analogies I&#39;ve come up with is you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.250" end="01:02:05.170" style="s2">I think undergraduate elite</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.690" end="01:02:08.499" style="s2">undergraduate</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.170" end="01:02:10.029" style="s2">is like junior highschool football you</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.499" end="01:02:12.130" style="s2">know if you always go foot budget I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.029" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">see that coming it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.130" end="01:02:16.239" style="s2">football and junior high schools</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:18.099" style="s2">probably not damaging for you but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.239" end="01:02:19.869" style="s2">not going anywhere I see because if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.099" end="01:02:23.410" style="s2">keep playing football in high school and</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.869" end="01:02:25.630" style="s2">college and then professionally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.410" end="01:02:28.900" style="s2">just bad and the better you are the more</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.630" end="01:02:31.839" style="s2">successful you are the the let the less</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.900" end="01:02:33.430" style="s2">well it works and and then the question</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.839" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">is what&#39;s the motivational structure you</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.430" end="01:02:37.749" style="s2">know when I was an undergraduate in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:40.390" style="s2">1980s there was still a part of it where</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.749" end="01:02:41.380" style="s2">you thought the professors were cool it</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.390" end="01:02:43.420" style="s2">you know might be something you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.380" end="01:02:45.339" style="s2">to be at some point in the future you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.420" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">know um and and they were role models</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.339" end="01:02:50.259" style="s2">just like in you know junior high school</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:52.390" style="s2">football and an NFL player you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.259" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">would have been a role model but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.390" end="01:02:56.710" style="s2">great damage in both side now now I</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:57.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you&#39;re just yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.710" end="01:03:00.460" style="s2">you&#39;re just doing lots of brain damage</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.910" end="01:03:02.920" style="s2">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s a track that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.460" end="01:03:05.469" style="s2">work and therefore the teleology sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.920" end="01:03:07.479" style="s2">was broken down so undergraduate part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.469" end="01:03:09.910" style="s2">the teleology was that it was preparing</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.479" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">you for graduate school and that part</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.910" end="01:03:13.059" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:15.249" style="s2">what&#39;s gotten deranged who then graduate</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.059" end="01:03:17.910" style="s2">school well it&#39;s preparing you to be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.249" end="01:03:19.749" style="s2">postdoc and then well that&#39;s the postdoc</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.910" end="01:03:22.630" style="s2">apocalypse where we want to call it</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.749" end="01:03:23.769" style="s2">postdoc ellipse postdoc ellipse postdoc</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.630" end="01:03:27.249" style="s2">you heard it here folks</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.769" end="01:03:30.130" style="s2">host ups and and so but just at every</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.249" end="01:03:32.229" style="s2">step I think the teleology the system is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.130" end="01:03:34.239" style="s2">is in really bad shape it&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.229" end="01:03:36.940" style="s2">this is true of all these institutions</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.239" end="01:03:39.219" style="s2">with fake growth that are sociopathic or</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.940" end="01:03:41.739" style="s2">pathological but at the universities</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.219" end="01:03:43.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s striking is it&#39;s very bad</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.739" end="01:03:46.150" style="s2">and I think this was already true in</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.599" end="01:03:47.859" style="s2">important ways in a back in the 80s</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.150" end="01:03:49.960" style="s2">early 90s when I was going through the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.859" end="01:03:53.640" style="s2">system and when I think when I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.960" end="01:03:56.140" style="s2">back on it um I think I was most</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.640" end="01:03:58.630" style="s2">intensely motivated academically in high</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.140" end="01:04:00.309" style="s2">school because the teleology was really</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.630" end="01:04:03.099" style="s2">clear you were trying to get into a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.309" end="01:04:04.420" style="s2">college and then by the time I was at</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.099" end="01:04:06.759" style="s2">Stanford it was a little bit less clear</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.420" end="01:04:09.489" style="s2">by the time I was a law school really</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.759" end="01:04:11.710" style="s2">unclear what that was going and and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.489" end="01:04:14.049" style="s2">was by the time I was you know 25 I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.710" end="01:04:17.319" style="s2">far less motivated than then at age 18</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.049" end="01:04:19.749" style="s2">so and I think I think these dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.319" end="01:04:22.979" style="s2">just in a more extreme than ever today</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.749" end="01:04:25.539" style="s2">what I find so dispiriting about your</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.979" end="01:04:29.019" style="s2">your diagnosis is first of all that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.539" end="01:04:31.089" style="s2">agree with second of all if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.019" end="01:04:32.890" style="s2">train people in these fields like if we</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.089" end="01:04:35.650" style="s2">don&#39;t get people to go into molecular</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.890" end="01:04:37.660" style="s2">biology or bioinformatics or something</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.650" end="01:04:39.940" style="s2">like that we&#39;re never going to be able</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.660" end="01:04:43.690" style="s2">to find the low-hanging fruit in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.940" end="01:04:46.569" style="s2">orchard so it seems to me that we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.690" end="01:04:50.469" style="s2">to find some way that it makes sense for</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.569" end="01:04:51.999" style="s2">a life to explore these questions one of</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.469" end="01:04:53.140" style="s2">the things that I don&#39;t understand and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.999" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you have any insight go</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.140" end="01:04:57.819" style="s2">ahead and you know go ahead keep going</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:59.589" style="s2">well I was gonna say is that um it feels</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.819" end="01:05:02.289" style="s2">to me that almost all of our</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.589" end="01:05:04.660" style="s2">institutions are carbon copies of each</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.289" end="01:05:06.699" style="s2">other at different levels of quality and</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.660" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">that there are only a tiny number of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.699" end="01:05:11.739" style="s2">actually innovative institutions it used</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:14.410" style="s2">to be that you know Reed College was sex</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.739" end="01:05:16.719" style="s2">drugs and Goethe and you had you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.410" end="01:05:17.949" style="s2">st. John&#39;s with the great books</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.719" end="01:05:20.019" style="s2">curriculum that didn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.949" end="01:05:21.789" style="s2">anything else or Deep Springs and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.019" end="01:05:25.680" style="s2">University of Chicago was crazy about</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.789" end="01:05:30.430" style="s2">young people but the diversity of</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.680" end="01:05:34.029" style="s2">institutions is unbelievably low is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.430" end="01:05:37.719" style="s2">wrong I think that&#39;s that&#39;s fair but I I</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.029" end="01:05:39.339" style="s2">would say yeah beyond the bigger problem</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.719" end="01:05:41.650" style="s2">with a lot of these fields it&#39;s yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.339" end="01:05:42.910" style="s2">think we have to keep training people I</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.650" end="01:05:44.289" style="s2">think we need to keep training people in</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.910" end="01:05:45.910" style="s2">physics or even these fields that seem</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.289" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">completely dead I&#39;m not you know super</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.910" end="01:05:49.569" style="s2">important but I think the question is um</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:52.479" style="s2">we have to always ask is how many people</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.569" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">should we be training and you know my</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.479" end="01:05:57.160" style="s2">intuition is you want even if you want</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:06:00.249" style="s2">the gates to be very tight one of my</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.160" end="01:06:03.759" style="s2">friends is a is in the professor in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.249" end="01:06:05.469" style="s2">Stanford Economics Department and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.759" end="01:06:08.979" style="s2">way he describes it to me is they have</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.469" end="01:06:11.469" style="s2">about 30 graduate students starting PhDs</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.979" end="01:06:13.209" style="s2">in economics at Stanford every year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.469" end="01:06:16.449" style="s2">you know six to eight years to get a PhD</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.209" end="01:06:19.660" style="s2">at the end of the first year the faculty</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.449" end="01:06:21.459" style="s2">has an implicit ranking of the students</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.660" end="01:06:23.650" style="s2">where they sort of agreed who the top</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.459" end="01:06:25.599" style="s2">three or four are the top that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.650" end="01:06:27.400" style="s2">ranking never changes the top three or</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.599" end="01:06:29.170" style="s2">four have a are able to get a good</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.400" end="01:06:29.650" style="s2">position in academia the others not so</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.170" end="01:06:31.340" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.650" end="01:06:33.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.340" end="01:06:35.210" style="s2">and you know this is it we&#39;re pretending</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.800" end="01:06:37.850" style="s2">to be kind to people and we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.210" end="01:06:41.180" style="s2">being cruel incredibly cruel um and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.850" end="01:06:42.860" style="s2">and so I think that that if there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.180" end="01:06:45.140" style="s2">going to be you know it&#39;s a supply</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.860" end="01:06:49.100" style="s2">demand of labor if they&#39;re gonna be good</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.140" end="01:06:52.250" style="s2">um good positions in academia where you</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.100" end="01:06:53.900" style="s2">can you know have a reasonable life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.250" end="01:06:55.940" style="s2">not a monastic vow of poverty that</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.900" end="01:06:58.940" style="s2">you&#39;re taking to be an academic if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.940" end="01:07:00.860" style="s2">gonna have that you want you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.940" end="01:07:02.630" style="s2">the sort of Malthusian struggle if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.860" end="01:07:04.580" style="s2">have ten graduate students in a</p>

<p begin="01:07:49.480" end="01:07:59.500" style="s2">it it seems to me that power laws those</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.690" end="01:08:01.970" style="s2">distributions with very thick tails</p>

<p begin="01:08:56.720" end="01:09:02.930" style="s2">19th century right and you know most</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.170" end="01:09:04.490" style="s2">people were farmers and presumably some</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.930" end="01:09:06.980" style="s2">people were better farmers than others</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.490" end="01:09:10.490" style="s2">but you know everyone started within 140</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.980" end="01:09:13.640" style="s2">acres of land and and there was this</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.490" end="01:09:15.710" style="s2">wide-open frontier even if you had some</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.640" end="01:09:18.140" style="s2">parts of the society that had more of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.710" end="01:09:20.450" style="s2">power-law dynamic there was a large part</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.140" end="01:09:22.910" style="s2">that didn&#39;t and that was that was what</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.450" end="01:09:25.910" style="s2">what I think gave it a certain certain</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.910" end="01:09:29.120" style="s2">amount of health and yeah the challenges</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.910" end="01:09:33.100" style="s2">if we&#39;ve geared our society saying that</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.120" end="01:09:36.530" style="s2">all that matters is education and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.100" end="01:09:39.320" style="s2">PhDs and academic research and that this</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.530" end="01:09:41.300" style="s2">has this crazy power law dynamic then</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.320" end="01:09:43.880" style="s2">then you&#39;re just going to have a society</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.300" end="01:09:45.470" style="s2">in which there are you know lots of</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.880" end="01:09:47.000" style="s2">people playing video games and basements</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.470" end="01:09:49.580" style="s2">or something like that so that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.000" end="01:09:51.260" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the way I</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.580" end="01:09:52.970" style="s2">would I would frame it but yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.260" end="01:09:54.970" style="s2">I think there are there&#39;s definitely are</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.970" end="01:09:57.830" style="s2">some areas where this is the case and</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.970" end="01:09:59.210" style="s2">and then you know we just need you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.830" end="01:10:02.270" style="s2">we need we need more growth for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.210" end="01:10:03.980" style="s2">whole society if you have growth you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.270" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">have a rising tide that lifts all boats</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.980" end="01:10:08.540" style="s2">and so it&#39;s always you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:12.200" style="s2">stagnation is the problem well you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.540" end="01:10:14.780" style="s2">I I&#39;ve joked about this as we are not</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.200" end="01:10:16.870" style="s2">even communistic in our progressivism</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.780" end="01:10:19.130" style="s2">because the old</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.870" end="01:10:20.540" style="s2">formulation of communism was from each</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.130" end="01:10:23.030" style="s2">according to his abilities to each</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.540" end="01:10:25.700" style="s2">according to his needs and the inability</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.030" end="01:10:28.880" style="s2">to recognize different levels of ability</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.700" end="01:10:30.740" style="s2">I mean like almost every mathematician</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.880" end="01:10:33.020" style="s2">or physicists who encountered John VII</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.740" end="01:10:34.340" style="s2">Normans just said he the guy is smarter</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.020" end="01:10:36.130" style="s2">than I am it&#39;s not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.340" end="01:10:39.350" style="s2">deepest or he did all of the great work</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.130" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">but you know when you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.350" end="01:10:44.750" style="s2">somebody who is able to employ skills</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:48.500" style="s2">that you simply don&#39;t have I mean I know</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.750" end="01:10:50.540" style="s2">I&#39;m not a concert pianist and right okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.500" end="01:10:52.550" style="s2">I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how you solve the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.540" end="01:10:54.290" style="s2">social problem right if everybody has to</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.550" end="01:10:56.660" style="s2">be a mathematician or a concert pianist</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.290" end="01:10:57.740" style="s2">that that that like well I want a</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.660" end="01:10:59.000" style="s2">society in which we have great</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.740" end="01:11:02.600" style="s2">mathematicians and great</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.000" end="01:11:04.220" style="s2">answered pianists that that seems that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.600" end="01:11:06.410" style="s2">that would be very healthy society right</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.220" end="01:11:08.240" style="s2">it&#39;s very unhealthy if every parent</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.410" end="01:11:10.250" style="s2">thinks their child has to be a</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.240" end="01:11:12.650" style="s2">mathematician or initiative pianist and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.250" end="01:11:14.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.650" end="01:11:15.830" style="s2">society we we unfortunately have well</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.600" end="01:11:18.220" style="s2">this is why</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.830" end="01:11:21.290" style="s2">so this is where why I try to sell you</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.220" end="01:11:25.130" style="s2">sometimes on a more progressive view of</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.290" end="01:11:27.320" style="s2">the world which is I want deregulated</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.130" end="01:11:29.450" style="s2">capitalism I want the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.320" end="01:11:30.980" style="s2">the rare skill sets to be able to</p>

<p begin="01:11:33.170" end="01:11:37.700" style="s2">thing that that I wish more people</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.700" end="01:11:41.240" style="s2">understood about what you bring which is</p>

<p begin="01:12:21.530" end="01:12:28.910" style="s2">think yes look if we had if we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.800" end="01:12:31.370" style="s2">runaway automation right and you know if</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.910" end="01:12:32.960" style="s2">we&#39;re building robots that are smarter</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.370" end="01:12:36.020" style="s2">than humans and can do everything humans</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.960" end="01:12:37.910" style="s2">can do then we probably have to have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.020" end="01:12:39.590" style="s2">serious conversation about a universal</p>

<p begin="01:12:41.810" end="01:12:47.930" style="s2">very very weird society I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.170" end="01:12:50.420" style="s2">see the automation happening at all and</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.930" end="01:12:52.190" style="s2">I think the question of automation in my</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.420" end="01:12:55.790" style="s2">mind is identical to this question of</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.190" end="01:12:58.370" style="s2">productivity growth um there is you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.790" end="01:13:00.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve been automating for 200 250 years</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.370" end="01:13:04.000" style="s2">since the Industrial Revolution</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.550" end="01:13:06.680" style="s2">agriculture and industry factoring and</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.000" end="01:13:11.480" style="s2">the sort of society we have in the early</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.680" end="01:13:13.760" style="s2">21st century is one in which most jobs</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.480" end="01:13:16.760" style="s2">our non-tradable service sector jobs</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.760" end="01:13:18.890" style="s2">that are not easily automatable so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.760" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">like a waiter and restaurant it&#39;s a yoga</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.890" end="01:13:21.470" style="s2">instructor it&#39;s nurse it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:24.320" style="s2">kindergarten teacher</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.470" end="01:13:27.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that&#39;s what most jobs in</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.320" end="01:13:30.350" style="s2">our society are and because they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.340" end="01:13:33.050" style="s2">they&#39;ve been so resistant to automation</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.350" end="01:13:34.130" style="s2">that this may be one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.050" end="01:13:36.710" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.130" end="01:13:37.130" style="s2">the productivity numbers are are slowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.710" end="01:13:38.600" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.130" end="01:13:40.790" style="s2">even if we&#39;re still innovating as fast</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.600" end="01:13:42.170" style="s2">and manufacturing and even if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.790" end="01:13:44.060" style="s2">still improving agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.170" end="01:13:46.250" style="s2">they&#39;re smaller and smaller part of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.060" end="01:13:47.470" style="s2">economy and so even 5% of your</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.250" end="01:13:49.460" style="s2">productivity growth in manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.470" end="01:13:51.320" style="s2">that means a lot more than manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.460" end="01:13:53.930" style="s2">60% of the economy than it does when</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.320" end="01:13:56.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a 20% of the economy and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.930" end="01:14:01.390" style="s2">that&#39;s roughly uh that&#39;s roughly what I</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.840" end="01:14:03.530" style="s2">what I think I think would happen and</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.390" end="01:14:05.750" style="s2">you know if you just if you just look at</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.530" end="01:14:07.640" style="s2">the you know the current the current</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.750" end="01:14:10.820" style="s2">dynamic in the u.s. is we have you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.640" end="01:14:14.630" style="s2">unemployment like 3.6 3.7 percent right</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.820" end="01:14:15.710" style="s2">it&#39;s super low it&#39;s um and still there</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.630" end="01:14:18.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be that much wage</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.710" end="01:14:20.270" style="s2">pressure that there doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.230" end="01:14:21.440" style="s2">that much growth the productivity</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.270" end="01:14:22.850" style="s2">numbers still aren&#39;t great you think</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.440" end="01:14:25.790" style="s2">there&#39;d be enormous and quite</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.850" end="01:14:27.620" style="s2">conservative me yeah um but I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.790" end="01:14:29.060" style="s2">again Mike Mike my read on it is just</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.620" end="01:14:31.190" style="s2">the the automation story has been</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.060" end="01:14:32.150" style="s2">oversold like I agree the automation</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.190" end="01:14:33.440" style="s2">story&#39;s been over it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.150" end="01:14:35.030" style="s2">possible it&#39;s going to happen the</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.440" end="01:14:37.160" style="s2">hospitals just around the corner and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.030" end="01:14:38.450" style="s2">it&#39;s about about to happen well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.160" end="01:14:40.370" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been told in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.450" end="01:14:42.739" style="s2">areas over the last you know 40 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.370" end="01:14:44.900" style="s2">so I have a couple questions about this</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.739" end="01:14:47.630" style="s2">one is sort of if I think about how</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.900" end="01:14:49.880" style="s2">common retail occupations are is there</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.630" end="01:14:54.500" style="s2">something about retail that is resistant</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.880" end="01:14:56.750" style="s2">to Amazon ofin if you will where people</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.500" end="01:14:57.890" style="s2">actually want to go shop in a physical</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.750" end="01:14:59.630" style="s2">place and are willing to pay a premium</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.890" end="01:15:01.280" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t understood but to have</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.630" end="01:15:02.989" style="s2">human contact maybe there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.280" end="01:15:04.730" style="s2">information exchanged maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.989" end="01:15:06.680" style="s2">recreational aspect that&#39;s bundled</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.730" end="01:15:09.380" style="s2">that&#39;s one of my two questions the other</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.680" end="01:15:11.900" style="s2">one surrounds the idea that we&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.380" end="01:15:13.660" style="s2">focused on like when is a GI coming and</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.900" end="01:15:16.220" style="s2">the robots that will do everything and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.660" end="01:15:18.440" style="s2">part of the lesson for me about machine</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.220" end="01:15:20.890" style="s2">learning is how many things humans were</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.440" end="01:15:23.120" style="s2">doing that don&#39;t require anything like</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.890" end="01:15:25.039" style="s2">artificial general intelligence just</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.120" end="01:15:27.530" style="s2">some specialized neural net</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.039" end="01:15:29.329" style="s2">seems to be good enough to do the job so</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.530" end="01:15:33.889" style="s2">those would be two questions in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.329" end="01:15:35.719" style="s2">as to how yes yes but I think all these</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.889" end="01:15:39.170" style="s2">things you know you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.719" end="01:15:42.800" style="s2">concretize right and yes i i think</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.170" end="01:15:45.409" style="s2">retail is is a sector that&#39;s under you</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.800" end="01:15:47.960" style="s2">know quite a bit of pressure is going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.409" end="01:15:50.059" style="s2">stay under quite a bit of pressure that</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.960" end="01:15:51.619" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe the top that&#39;s the the top</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.059" end="01:15:55.940" style="s2">one I would it&#39;s pretty looks like</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.619" end="01:15:57.800" style="s2">vulnerable to me but that&#39;s the and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.940" end="01:16:00.260" style="s2">know and that&#39;s sort of that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.800" end="01:16:01.760" style="s2">Amazon is the is the most threatening of</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.260" end="01:16:03.710" style="s2">the big tech companies and that it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.760" end="01:16:05.300" style="s2">know threatening a lot of other</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.710" end="01:16:07.099" style="s2">companies elsewhere in the industry and</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.300" end="01:16:09.079" style="s2">disrupting them and you know making</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.099" end="01:16:11.409" style="s2">things more efficient but you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.079" end="01:16:15.320" style="s2">probably with with a lot of sheer forces</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.409" end="01:16:17.929" style="s2">at work in that process so um so I agree</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.320" end="01:16:20.119" style="s2">that that&#39;s a candidate for you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.929" end="01:16:21.889" style="s2">automation or productivity improvements</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.119" end="01:16:24.320" style="s2">or things like that I&#39;m still not</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.889" end="01:16:26.780" style="s2">convinced that it&#39;s in the aggregate</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.320" end="01:16:28.280" style="s2">shifting things that much you know and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.780" end="01:16:32.420" style="s2">then go through and go through all sorts</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.280" end="01:16:35.780" style="s2">of individual job descriptions where you</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.420" end="01:16:38.929" style="s2">know uh people used to have secretaries</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.780" end="01:16:40.849" style="s2">because typing was a skill and you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.929" end="01:16:42.260" style="s2">the word processor you don&#39;t quite need</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.849" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">this you can do short emails you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.260" end="01:16:45.829" style="s2">quite need a secretary people still have</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.000" end="01:16:48.590" style="s2">executive assistants that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.829" end="01:16:50.269" style="s2">somehow do slightly different set of</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.590" end="01:16:51.710" style="s2">responsibilities but it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.269" end="01:16:53.929" style="s2">clearly a fewer executive assistants</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.710" end="01:16:56.449" style="s2">that we used to have secretaries and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.929" end="01:17:00.070" style="s2">when one actually concretize is it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.449" end="01:17:03.769" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s not quite clear how much</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.070" end="01:17:06.500" style="s2">you know how disruptive the automation</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.769" end="01:17:08.690" style="s2">that&#39;s happening you know it really is</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.500" end="01:17:10.070" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s always straight is he and</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.690" end="01:17:12.679" style="s2">this is it&#39;s a version of the text AG</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.070" end="01:17:14.840" style="s2">nation thing right it&#39;s always last 4050</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.679" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">years things have been slow we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.840" end="01:17:19.309" style="s2">told it&#39;s about to accelerate like crazy</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:19.909" style="s2">that may be true in some ways I hope</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.309" end="01:17:22.730" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.909" end="01:17:24.519" style="s2">um but if one was simply extrapolating</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.730" end="01:17:27.050" style="s2">from the last 40 to 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.519" end="01:17:28.429" style="s2">perhaps the the default is that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.050" end="01:17:31.099" style="s2">should be more worried about the lack of</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.429" end="01:17:34.250" style="s2">automation than excess automation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.099" end="01:17:35.750" style="s2">really interesting and and so yes if and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.250" end="01:17:37.470" style="s2">again I think if we had the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.750" end="01:17:39.930" style="s2">runaway automation</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.470" end="01:17:42.390" style="s2">I mean you could get to like 3/4 percent</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.930" end="01:17:44.010" style="s2">GDP growth and at 3 to 4 percent GDP</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.390" end="01:17:45.900" style="s2">growth we can solve these problems</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.010" end="01:17:47.820" style="s2">socially you would be willing to have</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.900" end="01:17:49.830" style="s2">like you know this thing that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.820" end="01:17:52.860" style="s2">talking to Andrew yang about has been</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.830" end="01:17:55.800" style="s2">the idea of hyper capitalism which is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.860" end="01:17:57.840" style="s2">deregulated hyper kappa hyper capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.800" end="01:18:01.770" style="s2">where you can do more experimenting or</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.840" end="01:18:03.990" style="s2">playing copper couple to some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.770" end="01:18:06.030" style="s2">hyper socialism where you recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.990" end="01:18:09.690" style="s2">the median individual might not be able</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.030" end="01:18:12.200" style="s2">in the future to easily defend a</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.690" end="01:18:15.330" style="s2">position needed for family formation</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.200" end="01:18:16.410" style="s2">well let me rephrase this a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.330" end="01:18:18.990" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get a conversion</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.410" end="01:18:20.580" style="s2">experience on your first podcast here to</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.990" end="01:18:24.120" style="s2">make me wait for the next and maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.580" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">little longer than that too but I would</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.120" end="01:18:31.320" style="s2">say um if we can get the GDP growth back</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:33.900" style="s2">to 3 percent a year on a sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.320" end="01:18:35.190" style="s2">basis without fudging without fudging</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.900" end="01:18:38.910" style="s2">without lying about productivity numbers</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.190" end="01:18:42.900" style="s2">etc then on there will be a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.910" end="01:18:44.580" style="s2">room for for various social programs I</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.900" end="01:18:45.930" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want them to be misdirected in</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.580" end="01:18:48.840" style="s2">all sorts of ways but there would be a</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.930" end="01:18:53.040" style="s2">lot of things that we we could we could</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.840" end="01:18:55.440" style="s2">do I should say and I&#39;m and um I I would</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.040" end="01:18:57.750" style="s2">be very uncomfortable starting with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.440" end="01:19:00.510" style="s2">social programs without the growth and</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.750" end="01:19:02.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.510" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">conversation that I often see happening</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.490" end="01:19:07.170" style="s2">in Silicon Valley where where it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:10.260" style="s2">start with ubi right because we&#39;re lying</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.170" end="01:19:12.210" style="s2">about automation if automation of</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.260" end="01:19:13.290" style="s2">automation is happening then we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.210" end="01:19:14.520" style="s2">in the productivity numbers and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.290" end="01:19:17.730" style="s2">eventually maybe we need something like</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.520" end="01:19:20.160" style="s2">ubi if automation is not happening and</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.730" end="01:19:22.620" style="s2">you do ubi then you just you know blow</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.160" end="01:19:24.540" style="s2">up the economy right I should say and</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.620" end="01:19:25.980" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve caused a question you</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.540" end="01:19:27.690" style="s2">know it&#39;s you&#39;ve come somewhat toward</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.980" end="01:19:28.500" style="s2">coming them doing them in parallel yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.690" end="01:19:31.080" style="s2">I&#39;m ok with that</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.500" end="01:19:33.930" style="s2">no no I&#39;m not not ok with starting with</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.080" end="01:19:35.250" style="s2">the socialism well so I appreciate you</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.930" end="01:19:36.870" style="s2">even a Marxist wouldn&#39;t believe this</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.250" end="01:19:38.130" style="s2">even a Marxist thinks to the you have to</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.870" end="01:19:40.110" style="s2">first get the capitals to do things</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.130" end="01:19:41.490" style="s2">before you can redistribute stuff right</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.110" end="01:19:42.810" style="s2">I know and you can&#39;t start with a</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.490" end="01:19:44.490" style="s2">redistribution before we&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.810" end="01:19:46.140" style="s2">automation I&#39;m not even a Marxist Peter</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.490" end="01:19:48.450" style="s2">but the thing that I was going to say is</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.140" end="01:19:49.260" style="s2">is that as you talk about the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.450" end="01:19:50.840" style="s2">we can solve some of these problems</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.260" end="01:19:52.969" style="s2">socially I want</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.840" end="01:19:56.630" style="s2">talk about from the progressive side I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.969" end="01:19:58.699" style="s2">not interested in using social programs</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.630" end="01:20:01.699" style="s2">where markets continue to function I</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.699" end="01:20:03.440" style="s2">mean the idea of making people</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.699" end="01:20:06.500" style="s2">personally accountable for their own</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.440" end="01:20:08.389" style="s2">happiness and their own success and path</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.500" end="01:20:11.320" style="s2">through the world is incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.389" end="01:20:14.030" style="s2">liberating and I view markets as</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.320" end="01:20:17.210" style="s2">providing most of the progress that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.030" end="01:20:19.790" style="s2">now enjoy so there is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.210" end="01:20:22.280" style="s2">very weird and punitive about the desire</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.790" end="01:20:25.250" style="s2">for redistribution I mean that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.280" end="01:20:27.290" style="s2">almost a desire to tag the wealthy that</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.250" end="01:20:31.099" style="s2">has nothing to do with taking care of</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.290" end="01:20:34.550" style="s2">the unfortunate and what I really am</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.099" end="01:20:36.679" style="s2">talking about here is how do we get a</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.550" end="01:20:40.489" style="s2">conversation between left and right</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.679" end="01:20:42.560" style="s2">which isn&#39;t cryptic which isn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.489" end="01:20:44.300" style="s2">of course I have a much more cynical</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.560" end="01:20:47.599" style="s2">view of this where I think the</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.300" end="01:20:49.010" style="s2">redistribution rhetoric it&#39;s mainly not</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.599" end="01:20:51.889" style="s2">even targeted at the wealthy</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.010" end="01:20:54.650" style="s2">oh it&#39;s targeted at the lower middle</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.889" end="01:20:56.270" style="s2">class at the deplorable z-- or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.650" end="01:20:58.639" style="s2">you want to call them and it&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.270" end="01:21:01.150" style="s2">tell them that they will never get ahead</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.639" end="01:21:04.280" style="s2">nothing will happen in their life and</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.150" end="01:21:06.349" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s actually why you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.280" end="01:21:09.290" style="s2">a lot of people who are lower middle</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.349" end="01:21:11.810" style="s2">class or middle class are viscerally</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.290" end="01:21:14.030" style="s2">quite strongly opposed to welfare</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.810" end="01:21:15.860" style="s2">because it&#39;s always an insult to them</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.030" end="01:21:18.889" style="s2">and he&#39;s always heard as an insult and</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.860" end="01:21:20.540" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re wrong to feel</p>

<p begin="01:25:45.890" end="01:25:50.030" style="s2">very undesirable I think that there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.380" end="01:25:52.700" style="s2">so fascinating that we actually finally</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.030" end="01:25:55.040" style="s2">get to something like this I think that</p>

<p begin="01:25:57.860" end="01:26:01.909" style="s2">there were a lot of people I think in</p>

<p begin="01:26:03.739" end="01:26:08.030" style="s2">and some of it probably dipped into</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.149" end="01:26:10.669" style="s2">communism what my sense of it was is</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.030" end="01:26:11.959" style="s2">that there was a period in the 30s where</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.669" end="01:26:14.119" style="s2">people realized that there had to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.959" end="01:26:15.800" style="s2">coordinated social action and that there</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.119" end="01:26:20.630" style="s2">were people who were too vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.800" end="01:26:22.519" style="s2">that that somehow got wrapped up in all</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.630" end="01:26:24.679" style="s2">of the things that Stalin was talking</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.519" end="01:26:27.169" style="s2">about that sounded positive if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.679" end="01:26:30.469" style="s2">didn&#39;t know the reality so for example</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.169" end="01:26:32.630" style="s2">Paul robes and you know a hero of the of</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.469" end="01:26:36.469" style="s2">the of the left you know was extolling</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.630" end="01:26:38.659" style="s2">starla Stalin&#39;s virtues openly my guess</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.469" end="01:26:39.979" style="s2">is is that he didn&#39;t fully understand</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.659" end="01:26:42.380" style="s2">what had happened that he&#39;d gotten</p>

<p begin="01:26:44.599" end="01:26:48.110" style="s2">was a point which many people suddenly</p>

<p begin="01:26:50.030" end="01:26:54.139" style="s2">because at least it had the hope I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.639" end="01:26:57.110" style="s2">you know there were American blacks for</p>

<p begin="01:27:52.579" end="01:27:59.360" style="s2">think so and somehow somehow like maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.159" end="01:28:01.880" style="s2">yeah it maybe there were indirect ways</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.360" end="01:28:03.619" style="s2">that it was helpful or beneficial in</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.880" end="01:28:05.329" style="s2">countries that did not become communist</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.619" end="01:28:08.580" style="s2">but in countries that actually became</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.329" end="01:28:10.410" style="s2">communist you know it</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.580" end="01:28:12.570" style="s2">it didn&#39;t actually ever seem to work out</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.410" end="01:28:15.720" style="s2">for those people I definitely think that</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.570" end="01:28:18.330" style="s2">there was some sense that they were</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.720" end="01:28:19.860" style="s2">fooled and duped in this situation but</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.330" end="01:28:23.490" style="s2">by the same token not wanting to make</p>

<p begin="01:28:23.490" end="01:28:26.910" style="s2">I think that a lot of your rights would</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.380" end="01:28:28.710" style="s2">have been seen much earlier by the</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.910" end="01:28:34.080" style="s2">communists who were earlier to that</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.710" end="01:28:36.150" style="s2">party I think that to an extent some of</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.080" end="01:28:38.940" style="s2">the things that we just take for granted</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.150" end="01:28:41.640" style="s2">as part of living in a tolerant society</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.940" end="01:28:44.700" style="s2">we&#39;re really not found outside and so if</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.640" end="01:28:46.410" style="s2">you were trying to dine a la carte maybe</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.700" end="01:28:48.150" style="s2">you could take something from the comedy</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.410" end="01:28:51.120" style="s2">buffet you could take something from the</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.150" end="01:28:53.630" style="s2">anti-communist buffet and you could</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.120" end="01:28:56.670" style="s2">steal a little from you know regular</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.630" end="01:28:58.230" style="s2">party politics of course the Dixiecrats</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.670" end="01:28:59.940" style="s2">were not exactly the most racially</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.230" end="01:29:01.620" style="s2">progressive group in the world things</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.940" end="01:29:06.540" style="s2">were very different and there was no</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.620" end="01:29:08.460" style="s2">clear place to turn yes always it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.540" end="01:29:10.230" style="s2">always easy for us to judge people in</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.460" end="01:29:11.970" style="s2">the past - too harshly so I think I</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.230" end="01:29:15.720" style="s2">think that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.970" end="01:29:20.220" style="s2">generalization I I would I would say</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.720" end="01:29:23.610" style="s2">that the you know that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.220" end="01:29:25.950" style="s2">about the the revolution at the extreme</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.610" end="01:29:28.410" style="s2">revolutionary movements that always um</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.950" end="01:29:30.120" style="s2">seem to be from my point view the</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.410" end="01:29:32.610" style="s2">violence was always too much and I wind</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.120" end="01:29:36.330" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.610" end="01:29:37.560" style="s2">package it&#39;s a package deal but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.330" end="01:29:39.690" style="s2">like the violence part of the package</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.560" end="01:29:41.580" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the part</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.690" end="01:29:42.930" style="s2">that at the end of the day makes me</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.580" end="01:29:44.580" style="s2">think the package would not have been</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.930" end="01:29:46.110" style="s2">worth it so what I would like to do is</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.580" end="01:29:47.820" style="s2">to take a quick break and I would like</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.110" end="01:29:49.350" style="s2">to come back on exactly this point</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.820" end="01:29:53.130" style="s2">because it&#39;s the point where I feel that</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.350" end="01:29:55.260" style="s2">perhaps you are least understood by the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.130" end="01:29:58.320" style="s2">outside world with in terms of what</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.260" end="01:30:00.570" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about both growth and</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.320" end="01:30:02.820" style="s2">progress on the one hand and violence on</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.570" end="01:30:04.260" style="s2">the other so when we come back we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.820" end="01:30:07.680" style="s2">pick it up with Peter Thiel thank you</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.260" end="01:30:10.110" style="s2">thanks welcome back to the portal I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.680" end="01:30:12.750" style="s2">here with my friend and employer Peter</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.110" end="01:30:14.700" style="s2">Thiel for this our inaugural interview</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.750" end="01:30:17.940" style="s2">episode and we just gotten to a point</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.700" end="01:30:20.280" style="s2">which I think I hope people who have</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.940" end="01:30:21.710" style="s2">been tracking your career your books</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.280" end="01:30:23.810" style="s2">your thought process</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.710" end="01:30:25.520" style="s2">are gonna find interesting because I</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.810" end="01:30:27.320" style="s2">think it&#39;s the thing that if I had to</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.520" end="01:30:29.119" style="s2">guess would be the thing that people at</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.320" end="01:30:32.060" style="s2">least understand about you or maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.119" end="01:30:36.050" style="s2">have wrong the most ever since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.060" end="01:30:39.199" style="s2">known you your focus has weirdly been</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.050" end="01:30:41.510" style="s2">reduction of violence across a great</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.199" end="01:30:43.400" style="s2">number of different topics at a level</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.510" end="01:30:46.099" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think has leaked out into</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.400" end="01:30:48.590" style="s2">the public&#39;s understanding of you and</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.099" end="01:30:54.710" style="s2">what causes you to make the choices you</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.590" end="01:31:00.679" style="s2">make how do you see growth as attached</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.710" end="01:31:06.139" style="s2">to reduction of violence well I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.679" end="01:31:08.210" style="s2">that it&#39;s um it&#39;s very hard to see how</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.139" end="01:31:11.560" style="s2">anything like the kinds of societies we</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.210" end="01:31:14.810" style="s2">have in Western Europe the United States</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.560" end="01:31:16.639" style="s2">could function without without growth I</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.810" end="01:31:19.489" style="s2">think you know I think the way sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.639" end="01:31:20.929" style="s2">parliamentary Republican democracy works</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.489" end="01:31:23.300" style="s2">is you have a group of people sitting</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.929" end="01:31:25.340" style="s2">around the table they craft complicated</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.300" end="01:31:27.739" style="s2">legislation and there&#39;s a lot of horse</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.340" end="01:31:29.690" style="s2">trading and as long as the pie is</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.739" end="01:31:32.179" style="s2">growing you can give something to</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.690" end="01:31:35.060" style="s2">everybody when the pie stops growing it</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.179" end="01:31:37.369" style="s2">becomes a zero-sum dynamic and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.060" end="01:31:43.150" style="s2">legislative process does not work and</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.369" end="01:31:45.110" style="s2">and so the sort of democratic types of</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.150" end="01:31:48.170" style="s2">parliamentary systems we&#39;ve had for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.110" end="01:31:52.280" style="s2">last 200 250 years have mapped on to</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.170" end="01:31:54.139" style="s2">this period of of rapid growth we had</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.280" end="01:31:57.199" style="s2">sort of a very bad experiment in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.139" end="01:32:00.380" style="s2">1930s where the growth stopped at least</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.199" end="01:32:02.750" style="s2">sort of Nathan economic sense and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.380" end="01:32:05.270" style="s2">system you know systems became fascist</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.750" end="01:32:06.199" style="s2">or communist it didn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.270" end="01:32:10.219" style="s2">actually work</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.199" end="01:32:12.050" style="s2">and so I I suspect that if we&#39;re in for</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.219" end="01:32:14.659" style="s2">a period of long growth</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.050" end="01:32:17.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t think um I don&#39;t think our our</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.659" end="01:32:19.340" style="s2">kind of government can work I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.360" end="01:32:22.040" style="s2">there is a prospect of all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.340" end="01:32:24.170" style="s2">forms of violence more violence by the</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.040" end="01:32:27.650" style="s2">state against the citizens there may be</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.170" end="01:32:29.810" style="s2">more zero-sum Wars globally or there may</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.650" end="01:32:31.580" style="s2">be other ways things are super deformed</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.810" end="01:32:33.080" style="s2">to pacify people so maybe you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.580" end="01:32:34.160" style="s2">everyone just smokes marijuana all day</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.080" end="01:32:35.990" style="s2">but that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.160" end="01:32:38.110" style="s2">also kind of deformed but I think I</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.990" end="01:32:40.760" style="s2">think a world without growth is either</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.110" end="01:32:44.210" style="s2">going to be a much more violent or a</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.760" end="01:32:45.800" style="s2">much more deformed world and and again</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.210" end="01:32:49.160" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not the case that</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.800" end="01:32:51.200" style="s2">growth simply solves all problems so you</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.160" end="01:32:53.030" style="s2">can have very rapid growth and it can</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.200" end="01:32:54.500" style="s2">still you can still have the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.030" end="01:32:56.960" style="s2">violence you can still you can still</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.500" end="01:32:59.180" style="s2">have bad things that can happen but</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.960" end="01:33:01.490" style="s2">that&#39;s our only chance without growth I</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.180" end="01:33:04.280" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s very hard to see how</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.490" end="01:33:07.340" style="s2">you have a good future now in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.280" end="01:33:09.740" style="s2">whenever I hear you interpreted in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.340" end="01:33:13.160" style="s2">private means look you or you have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.740" end="01:33:17.420" style="s2">know that there is a version of a view</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.160" end="01:33:20.750" style="s2">that exists in the minds of pundits and</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.420" end="01:33:22.370" style="s2">you know the commentariat that just</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.750" end="01:33:25.460" style="s2">loves to paint you as if you were a</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.370" end="01:33:27.290" style="s2">cartoon villain and I always think that</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.460" end="01:33:29.630" style="s2">for those people who are actually</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.290" end="01:33:32.120" style="s2">confused about you as opposed to those</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.630" end="01:33:35.840" style="s2">who wish to be confused about you it</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.120" end="01:33:37.730" style="s2">says if you&#39;re looking through a window</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.840" end="01:33:39.860" style="s2">and they&#39;re looking at the reflection in</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.730" end="01:33:42.740" style="s2">the window not understanding what it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.860" end="01:33:47.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re focused on why do you think</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.740" end="01:33:50.680" style="s2">it is that almost nobody sees your</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.720" end="01:34:01.040" style="s2">preoccupation with violence reduction</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.680" end="01:34:02.720" style="s2">well it&#39;s um I I think um I think is</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.040" end="01:34:04.070" style="s2">always hard for me to come with a good</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.720" end="01:34:07.550" style="s2">answer these sort of sociological</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.070" end="01:34:09.440" style="s2">questions I think that I think people</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.550" end="01:34:12.050" style="s2">generally don&#39;t think of the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.440" end="01:34:14.240" style="s2">violence as quite as central as I I</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.050" end="01:34:16.700" style="s2">think I think it is I think it is a I</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.240" end="01:34:20.450" style="s2">think it&#39;s you know I&#39;m a very deep</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.700" end="01:34:22.670" style="s2">problem you know on a human level if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.450" end="01:34:25.370" style="s2">think of sort of this mimetic element to</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.670" end="01:34:28.550" style="s2">human nature where we copy one another</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.370" end="01:34:31.010" style="s2">we want the things other people want and</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.550" end="01:34:36.260" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.010" end="01:34:37.760" style="s2">of room for conflict and that you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.260" end="01:34:40.490" style="s2">if it&#39;s not channeled very carefully a</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.760" end="01:34:42.470" style="s2">violent conflict in human relationships</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.490" end="01:34:45.500" style="s2">and in human societies between human</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.470" end="01:34:48.019" style="s2">societies and this this is sort of I</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.500" end="01:34:50.329" style="s2">think a very very deep problem and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.019" end="01:34:52.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know sort of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.329" end="01:34:54.699" style="s2">Christian anthropology but you also have</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.190" end="01:34:56.480" style="s2">the same in Machiavelli or you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.699" end="01:34:59.329" style="s2">there are serve a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.480" end="01:35:00.920" style="s2">traditions where you know human beings</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.329" end="01:35:04.489" style="s2">are if not evil they&#39;re at least</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.920" end="01:35:08.389" style="s2">dangerous and and I think I think the</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.489" end="01:35:11.570" style="s2">sort of softer anthropological biases</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.389" end="01:35:13.909" style="s2">that that a lot of people have in you</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.570" end="01:35:16.219" style="s2">know sort of late modernity or in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.909" end="01:35:19.489" style="s2">Enlightenment world are that you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.219" end="01:35:22.999" style="s2">humans are by nature good they&#39;re by</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.489" end="01:35:24.889" style="s2">nature peaceful um and that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.999" end="01:35:27.139" style="s2">norm so there&#39;s you know that might be</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.889" end="01:35:29.420" style="s2">sort of a general bias people have is</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.139" end="01:35:32.119" style="s2">that people can&#39;t be this vile it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.420" end="01:35:33.650" style="s2">it&#39;s not the stipa problem it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.119" end="01:35:35.360" style="s2">problem other people have there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.650" end="01:35:38.269" style="s2">bad people who are violent but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.360" end="01:35:41.150" style="s2">a general problem you know one of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.269" end="01:35:44.630" style="s2">things that I think has been fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.150" end="01:35:46.400" style="s2">to me in you know I mean effectively I</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.630" end="01:35:48.139" style="s2">didn&#39;t know you when I was young and</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.400" end="01:35:50.449" style="s2">this feels like a lifelong friendship</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.139" end="01:35:52.249" style="s2">that got started way late in my life and</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.449" end="01:35:55.610" style="s2">one of the things that that kind of was</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.249" end="01:35:57.710" style="s2">surprising to me is that my coming from</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.610" end="01:35:59.989" style="s2">a Jewish background you&#39;re coming from a</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.710" end="01:36:03.320" style="s2">German background I think both of us</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.989" end="01:36:05.749" style="s2">were sent this sensitized by the horrors</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.320" end="01:36:08.230" style="s2">of World War two which I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.749" end="01:36:11.300" style="s2">the problem for the Jews is very clear</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.230" end="01:36:13.730" style="s2">but the fact that Germany never really</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.300" end="01:36:16.789" style="s2">recovered its proud intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.730" end="01:36:19.869" style="s2">traditions that had gotten bound up in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.789" end="01:36:22.639" style="s2">level of mechanized and planned violence</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.869" end="01:36:24.650" style="s2">you know the decimation of a great</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.639" end="01:36:26.210" style="s2">intellectual tradition and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.650" end="01:36:28.730" style="s2">things we&#39;ve talked about in the past is</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.210" end="01:36:31.730" style="s2">whether the twilight of living memory of</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.730" end="01:36:34.239" style="s2">the Holocaust should be used for some</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.730" end="01:36:36.460" style="s2">more profound German Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.239" end="01:36:39.710" style="s2">reconciliation that these are two</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.460" end="01:36:41.690" style="s2">communities that have held somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.710" end="01:36:44.719" style="s2">similar thought processes from the</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.690" end="01:36:46.639" style="s2">perspective of memetic competition maybe</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.719" end="01:36:48.050" style="s2">you know there was a there were there</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.639" end="01:36:49.849" style="s2">was a problem that they were doomed to</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.050" end="01:36:53.599" style="s2">run into each other but that in some</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.849" end="01:36:55.670" style="s2">sense there are two wounds that need to</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.599" end="01:36:58.820" style="s2">be healed now that all of the original</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.670" end="01:37:01.579" style="s2">participants are either quite elderly or</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.820" end="01:37:05.119" style="s2">gone do you think that that is in for</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.579" end="01:37:08.449" style="s2">our conversation well I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.119" end="01:37:11.089" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly um an element of that</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.449" end="01:37:16.609" style="s2">between between the two of us I I think</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.089" end="01:37:23.089" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s probably a degree</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.609" end="01:37:26.989" style="s2">to which on the history was so traumatic</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.089" end="01:37:28.729" style="s2">that that people still understate the</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.989" end="01:37:31.219" style="s2">this aspect there was there was</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.729" end="01:37:34.300" style="s2">something about you know late 19th</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.219" end="01:37:38.359" style="s2">century early 20th century Germany where</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.300" end="01:37:40.099" style="s2">the Judaism was better integrated into</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.359" end="01:37:42.409" style="s2">the society than in many other places</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.099" end="01:37:47.409" style="s2">and there was something very synergistic</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.409" end="01:37:51.919" style="s2">very very generative about that and and</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.409" end="01:37:55.849" style="s2">and and then you know getting at all</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.919" end="01:37:57.919" style="s2">these ways that at the the it was lost</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.849" end="01:38:02.059" style="s2">are very very hard to do you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.919" end="01:38:04.820" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a you know sort of a a the sort</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.059" end="01:38:08.030" style="s2">of social democratic response to the</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.820" end="01:38:09.800" style="s2">Hitler era and the Holocaust was sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.030" end="01:38:12.229" style="s2">radically egalitarian and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.800" end="01:38:15.050" style="s2">everybody&#39;s equal you shouldn&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.229" end="01:38:17.659" style="s2">people everybody is equally valuable and</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.050" end="01:38:19.820" style="s2">yet in some ways what was Hitler killed</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.659" end="01:38:21.739" style="s2">the best people and so there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.820" end="01:38:23.949" style="s2">which the the social democratic response</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.739" end="01:38:27.050" style="s2">to to what happened</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.949" end="01:38:28.459" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even come up to the terrible</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.050" end="01:38:30.709" style="s2">thing that happened so inegalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.459" end="01:38:32.389" style="s2">society will we don&#39;t miss quite as many</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.709" end="01:38:35.510" style="s2">people were all equal nothing&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.389" end="01:38:37.219" style="s2">changed but but well maybe you have no</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.510" end="01:38:39.619" style="s2">Jewish people left in Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.219" end="01:38:41.449" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot less dynamism in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.619" end="01:38:43.760" style="s2">society as a result and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.449" end="01:38:45.619" style="s2">that people still can&#39;t say in Germany</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.760" end="01:38:49.969" style="s2">because that&#39;s that right you feel like</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.619" end="01:38:52.550" style="s2">it&#39;s uh you know like if I say it people</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.969" end="01:38:57.079" style="s2">won&#39;t they won&#39;t they won&#39;t contradicted</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.550" end="01:38:59.179" style="s2">or anything but but it&#39;s uh it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.079" end="01:39:01.969" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.179" end="01:39:04.579" style="s2">profoundly uncomfortable so I think I</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.969" end="01:39:06.530" style="s2">think there is a sense yeah that that</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.579" end="01:39:08.899" style="s2">you know it&#39;s there&#39;s from all these</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.530" end="01:39:11.030" style="s2">strange ways that Germany still under</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.899" end="01:39:12.949" style="s2">the shadow of Hitler even even you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.030" end="01:39:15.320" style="s2">the ways that people are trying to you</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.949" end="01:39:17.660" style="s2">know exercise Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.320" end="01:39:20.180" style="s2">you know in some ways have deformed the</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.660" end="01:39:22.670" style="s2">society where you can&#39;t you can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.180" end="01:39:24.739" style="s2">back to the things that worked</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.670" end="01:39:26.720" style="s2">incredibly well in you know pre-world</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.739" end="01:39:27.830" style="s2">War one Germany there was probably a lot</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.720" end="01:39:29.840" style="s2">there was unhealthy and wrong with it</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.830" end="01:39:32.000" style="s2">too but but but</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.840" end="01:39:34.820" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a sense that something um</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.000" end="01:39:36.440" style="s2">you know something something very big</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.820" end="01:39:38.840" style="s2">has been lost there&#39;s that probably are</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.440" end="01:39:42.710" style="s2">a Jewish version of this that one could</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.840" end="01:39:43.730" style="s2">one could articulate as well but but</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.710" end="01:39:46.370" style="s2">yeah I think there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.730" end="01:39:50.330" style="s2">synergy that&#39;s uh that&#39;s that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.370" end="01:39:52.700" style="s2">powerful and that&#39;s quite missing so you</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.330" end="01:39:54.650" style="s2">know from from my side of the fence I</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.700" end="01:39:56.630" style="s2">was just listening on NPR to a</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.650" end="01:40:00.800" style="s2">description of Fiddler on the Roof being</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.630" end="01:40:04.010" style="s2">put on by Joel Grey in Yiddish and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.800" end="01:40:07.730" style="s2">sound of you know Jewish Middle High</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.010" end="01:40:12.040" style="s2">German there&#39;s something about it that</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.730" end="01:40:12.040" style="s2">is shocking in today&#39;s era</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.210" end="01:40:16.290" style="s2">and so there&#39;s been a Jewish loss you</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.040" end="01:40:20.180" style="s2">know I felt this a couple of times I</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.290" end="01:40:22.230" style="s2">avoided to be honest going to Germany</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.180" end="01:40:24.870" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t want to run into old</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.230" end="01:40:29.730" style="s2">people and wonder where they had been</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.870" end="01:40:31.290" style="s2">but eventually at Soros invitation found</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.730" end="01:40:33.480" style="s2">myself at a conference in Berlin and</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.290" end="01:40:35.460" style="s2">when I checked into the hotel I heard my</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.480" end="01:40:38.900" style="s2">last name pronounced in you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.460" end="01:40:41.910" style="s2">impeccable German and it was both a</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.900" end="01:40:44.580" style="s2">horrible feeling and a wonderful feeling</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.910" end="01:40:46.080" style="s2">like somehow weirdly something was home</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.580" end="01:40:49.050" style="s2">or I went to a restaurant near</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.080" end="01:40:51.870" style="s2">checkpoint charlie with my wife and I</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.050" end="01:40:55.050" style="s2">was missing a fork even like the person</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.870" end="01:40:57.930" style="s2">spoke no English and I remembered from a</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.050" end="01:41:00.240" style="s2">some old story of my father and I asked</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.930" end="01:41:02.250" style="s2">for a Gopal which I guess is the Yiddish</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.240" end="01:41:05.430" style="s2">for fork and it was close enough and</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.250" end="01:41:07.320" style="s2">somebody brought me a fork and by</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.430" end="01:41:10.860" style="s2">uttering a word that I got gobble gobble</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.320" end="01:41:13.590" style="s2">gobble okay Sherman yes by by going</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.860" end="01:41:15.960" style="s2">through that exercise I found that when</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.590" end="01:41:17.190" style="s2">this fork was brought to me I realized</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.960" end="01:41:20.130" style="s2">that there was some part of my</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.190" end="01:41:22.230" style="s2">experience in fact that was missing that</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.130" end="01:41:25.350" style="s2">this uncomfortable relationship which</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.230" end="01:41:29.130" style="s2">you know my grandfather when we when we</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.350" end="01:41:34.400" style="s2">went through Israel driving north to</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.130" end="01:41:37.710" style="s2">south was singing leader I mean he was</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.400" end="01:41:39.270" style="s2">German was the language of of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.710" end="01:41:41.640" style="s2">culture it was the language of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.270" end="01:41:45.360" style="s2">intellectual and that never left him and</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.640" end="01:41:48.870" style="s2">so I think that weirdly this is the</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.360" end="01:41:51.030" style="s2">first time because I think it&#39;ll be too</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.870" end="01:41:52.770" style="s2">late if we wait for in 20 more years</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.030" end="01:41:55.470" style="s2">because there will be no one to remember</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.770" end="01:42:00.830" style="s2">but that there is some opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.470" end="01:42:04.380" style="s2">recognize a dual wound yeah no I um I</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.830" end="01:42:05.760" style="s2">think I think the I think the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.380" end="01:42:08.490" style="s2">on the on the Germany side is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.760" end="01:42:10.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of I had I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.490" end="01:42:13.110" style="s2">somewhat of a you know idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.110" end="01:42:14.910" style="s2">background here where we I was born in</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.110" end="01:42:18.570" style="s2">Germany but we emigrated when I was</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.910" end="01:42:20.850" style="s2">about a year old and uh and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.570" end="01:42:24.270" style="s2">he spoke German at home and lived in</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.850" end="01:42:25.769" style="s2">Africa and Namibia where it went to</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.270" end="01:42:29.099" style="s2">German speaking school</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.769" end="01:42:32.940" style="s2">but it was it was very different I think</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.099" end="01:42:35.639" style="s2">from the from from the general</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.940" end="01:42:39.389" style="s2">post-world war ii german experience and</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.639" end="01:42:40.679" style="s2">and i and so there are gather all these</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.389" end="01:42:44.119" style="s2">things that i can see from the outside</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.679" end="01:42:47.400" style="s2">looking in to germany that i think are</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.119" end="01:42:49.139" style="s2">you know it&#39;s still like i still have a</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.400" end="01:42:51.809" style="s2">connection to it and this of all these</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.139" end="01:42:54.030" style="s2">ways you know you visited it as a child</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.809" end="01:42:55.920" style="s2">many times and this is something that i</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.030" end="01:42:58.019" style="s2">connect with and it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.920" end="01:43:03.119" style="s2">like like super different you know and</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.019" end="01:43:05.369" style="s2">and the the sort of you know the</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.119" end="01:43:07.320" style="s2">contrast of germany in california always</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.369" end="01:43:09.719" style="s2">like to give is that california&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.320" end="01:43:12.900" style="s2">optimistic but desperate and germany&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.719" end="01:43:14.670" style="s2">pessimistic but comfortable but the from</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.900" end="01:43:18.599" style="s2">a Californian perspective the past the</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.670" end="01:43:22.190" style="s2">the incredibly deep pessimism is is is</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.599" end="01:43:26.280" style="s2">is is is really really striking and and</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.190" end="01:43:27.480" style="s2">even on that one dimension i think you</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.280" end="01:43:30.449" style="s2">know jewish culture is is super</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.480" end="01:43:32.969" style="s2">different well and I feel like Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.449" end="01:43:36.269" style="s2">culture is in part starting to attenuate</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.969" end="01:43:39.449" style="s2">that we don&#39;t feel I mean this is this</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.269" end="01:43:40.650" style="s2">is crazy talk but we never thought that</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.449" end="01:43:43.380" style="s2">there was anything positive about</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.650" end="01:43:45.119" style="s2">anti-semitism and obviously it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.380" end="01:43:48.119" style="s2">positive thing but there were positive</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.119" end="01:43:50.489" style="s2">externalities and that it allowed us to</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.119" end="01:43:51.809" style="s2">push ourselves very very hard because we</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.489" end="01:43:54.449" style="s2">always knew that we weren&#39;t going to get</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.809" end="01:43:56.280" style="s2">a fair shake and that at any moment you</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.449" end="01:43:58.530" style="s2">might need to flee to someplace that was</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.280" end="01:44:00.360" style="s2">less dangerous and I feel that as we</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.530" end="01:44:02.070" style="s2">become comfortable we&#39;ve lost some of</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.360" end="01:44:03.929" style="s2">the dynamism which is a hard thing to</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.070" end="01:44:06.809" style="s2">admit but I do think that that is in</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.929" end="01:44:09.679" style="s2">part true just as I see you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.809" end="01:44:11.849" style="s2">see this in Germany Germany&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.679" end="01:44:15.690" style="s2">intellectual contribution was so</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.849" end="01:44:18.570" style="s2">profound that nothing post-world war ii</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.690" end="01:44:21.210" style="s2">seems to suggest the same nation and I</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.570" end="01:44:24.440" style="s2">think that that loss is a profound loss</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.210" end="01:44:28.380" style="s2">not to Germany but to the entire world</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.440" end="01:44:29.999" style="s2">yes it&#39;s uh it&#39;s you know and of course</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.380" end="01:44:31.739" style="s2">one of the challenges is you know we can</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.999" end="01:44:33.900" style="s2">you sort of describe these things we can</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.739" end="01:44:37.840" style="s2">speculate on you know you know some of</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.900" end="01:44:41.200" style="s2">the causal things it&#39;s uh I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.840" end="01:44:43.390" style="s2">it&#39;s somehow we don&#39;t want to go back we</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.200" end="01:44:47.260" style="s2">can&#39;t go back and don&#39;t want to I agree</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.390" end="01:44:49.330" style="s2">and uh and so yeah there is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.260" end="01:44:52.180" style="s2">history and you know I I think</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.330" end="01:44:56.230" style="s2">something&#39;s been lost in both Germany</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.180" end="01:44:59.350" style="s2">and in Jewish culture and how when how</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.230" end="01:45:02.140" style="s2">in reconstitutes this is is is even we</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.350" end="01:45:05.380" style="s2">can convince people of you know the</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.140" end="01:45:08.530" style="s2">causes and the losses what you actually</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.380" end="01:45:11.280" style="s2">do about it is is super hard to say and</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.530" end="01:45:15.130" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s sort of always the the</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.280" end="01:45:17.020" style="s2">strange dynamic in this something I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.130" end="01:45:19.840" style="s2">open to us working on at some future</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.020" end="01:45:23.590" style="s2">point if we can find the time but let me</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.840" end="01:45:26.800" style="s2">switch gears slightly and come back a</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.590" end="01:45:28.330" style="s2">little bit to the violence point but one</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.800" end="01:45:31.300" style="s2">of the things that I think has become</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.330" end="01:45:34.750" style="s2">kind of interesting in our relationship</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.300" end="01:45:37.120" style="s2">is that a a certain class of theories</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.750" end="01:45:39.990" style="s2">that are not popular in the general</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.120" end="01:45:42.750" style="s2">population are traded back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.990" end="01:45:46.210" style="s2">between us</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.750" end="01:45:48.280" style="s2">partially around the idea of how do we</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.210" end="01:45:51.910" style="s2">restart growth how do we avoid violence</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.280" end="01:45:53.740" style="s2">and I wanted to sort of alert people who</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.910" end="01:45:57.340" style="s2">are interested in the portal concept to</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.740" end="01:45:59.950" style="s2">this idea of orphaned or unpopular</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.340" end="01:46:02.740" style="s2">theories that are traded among a few but</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.950" end="01:46:04.780" style="s2">maybe not among the many so if we could</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.740" end="01:46:08.800" style="s2">go through a few of these one of them</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.780" end="01:46:13.420" style="s2">has to do with how you and I both were</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.800" end="01:46:15.880" style="s2">much more I think we believed that Trump</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.420" end="01:46:17.950" style="s2">was much more likely to get elected than</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.880" end="01:46:20.020" style="s2">the general population did and this has</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.950" end="01:46:23.080" style="s2">to do with the theory of preference</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.020" end="01:46:25.150" style="s2">falsification that people will broadly</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.080" end="01:46:26.800" style="s2">lie about what their true preferences</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.150" end="01:46:28.810" style="s2">are so they&#39;ll keep one set of public</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.800" end="01:46:31.180" style="s2">preferences but a hidden set of private</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.810" end="01:46:33.160" style="s2">preferences and then in our culture that</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.180" end="01:46:35.500" style="s2">gets revealed every four years where you</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.160" end="01:46:36.990" style="s2">might have have a schrödinger&#39;s you had</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.500" end="01:46:40.900" style="s2">experiment you find out where the</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.990" end="01:46:43.030" style="s2">actually is yes I ya know I felt this</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.900" end="01:46:45.700" style="s2">was a dynamic that was going on in all</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.030" end="01:46:47.770" style="s2">these strange ways in in 2016 there was</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.700" end="01:46:49.770" style="s2">a dinner I had in San Francisco about a</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.770" end="01:46:51.870" style="s2">week before the election with a group of</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.770" end="01:46:54.660" style="s2">center-right people one</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.870" end="01:46:55.980" style="s2">very prominent angel investor in Silicon</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.660" end="01:46:57.990" style="s2">Valley and he said you know I&#39;m voting</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.980" end="01:47:00.570" style="s2">for Trump in a week but because I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.990" end="01:47:02.820" style="s2">Silicon Valley I have to lie and so he</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.570" end="01:47:05.700" style="s2">was unusually honest about lying and and</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.820" end="01:47:07.230" style="s2">and the way the way I lie is that I tell</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.700" end="01:47:08.100" style="s2">people I&#39;m voting for Gary Johnson&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.230" end="01:47:09.720" style="s2">couldn&#39;t say that he was gonna vote for</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.100" end="01:47:10.620" style="s2">Hillary Clinton like the facial muscles</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.720" end="01:47:12.900" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work or something would go</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.620" end="01:47:16.410" style="s2">wrong but Gary Johnston was sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.900" end="01:47:17.520" style="s2">lie that you could could tell and and</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.410" end="01:47:18.810" style="s2">then if you actually look at what</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.520" end="01:47:21.210" style="s2">happened in the month before the</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.810" end="01:47:23.250" style="s2">election the gary johnson support you</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.210" end="01:47:25.410" style="s2">know collapsed from - um like six to two</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.250" end="01:47:28.820" style="s2">percent or whatever and as far as i can</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.410" end="01:47:31.560" style="s2">tell all of that went to to trump and</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.820" end="01:47:34.500" style="s2">and the question one has to ask is were</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.560" end="01:47:36.930" style="s2">these people you know lying all along</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.500" end="01:47:38.490" style="s2">were they lying to themselves did they</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.930" end="01:47:40.260" style="s2">sincerely change their mind in the last</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.490" end="01:47:42.900" style="s2">month or some some combination of that</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.260" end="01:47:44.730" style="s2">but but yeah one one sort of vehicle for</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.900" end="01:47:47.310" style="s2">this preference falsification was that</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.730" end="01:47:49.200" style="s2">you had got a third party Canada was</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.310" end="01:47:51.330" style="s2">sort of a gateway to the transitions</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.200" end="01:47:53.460" style="s2">this would happen with Ross Perot where</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.330" end="01:47:56.010" style="s2">the people when you know eventually went</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.460" end="01:47:58.230" style="s2">to Clinton in 92 or John Anderson in</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.010" end="01:47:59.940" style="s2">1980 so that&#39;s been that&#39;s been a sort</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.230" end="01:48:01.830" style="s2">of repeated pattern and that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.940" end="01:48:04.110" style="s2">that was one element of what was going</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.830" end="01:48:09.900" style="s2">on but then I think there were also um</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.110" end="01:48:13.770" style="s2">all these all these aspects of of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.900" end="01:48:15.810" style="s2">Trump candidacy that people were super</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.770" end="01:48:18.750" style="s2">uncomfortable about polite society and</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.810" end="01:48:19.920" style="s2">and so one would you know that the</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.750" end="01:48:22.590" style="s2">preference falsification was somehow</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.920" end="01:48:25.770" style="s2">perhaps much greater than in in many</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.590" end="01:48:27.120" style="s2">other other past contexts and so you</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.770" end="01:48:29.910" style="s2">know even even the day of the election</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.120" end="01:48:32.310" style="s2">the exit polls suggested that Trump was</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.910" end="01:48:34.920" style="s2">going to lose and so there was still a</p>

<p begin="01:49:49.120" end="01:49:53.590" style="s2">wonder about yeah I&#39;m you know because</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.670" end="01:49:57.310" style="s2">there was something about the polling</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.590" end="01:50:00.370" style="s2">that took on this unusually iconic role</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.310" end="01:50:02.230" style="s2">in 2016 it was so important and there</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.370" end="01:50:03.670" style="s2">was no truth outside the polls I</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.230" end="01:50:06.820" style="s2">remember there&#39;s you know one of the</p>

<p begin="01:50:14.080" end="01:50:19.180" style="s2">right but there was something about how</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.660" end="01:50:21.040" style="s2">how all-important they were in 2016 that</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.180" end="01:50:22.630" style="s2">that might have been a tell that</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.040" end="01:50:25.540" style="s2">something something was a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.630" end="01:50:27.280" style="s2">us I think people knew and for my from</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.540" end="01:50:29.320" style="s2">to my way of thinking I think people</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.280" end="01:50:31.120" style="s2">knew that there was something very</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.320" end="01:50:33.640" style="s2">bizarre about this election I think that</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.120" end="01:50:36.370" style="s2">the Bernie scare that if the Democratic</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.640" end="01:50:40.690" style="s2">Party hadn&#39;t been so skillfully and</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.370" end="01:50:42.370" style="s2">skillful in sidelining Bernie and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.690" end="01:50:46.660" style="s2">the party regulars were you know clearly</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.370" end="01:50:48.730" style="s2">backing Clinton my sense is that it</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.660" end="01:50:51.490" style="s2">could well have been Bernie versus Trump</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.730" end="01:50:54.280" style="s2">and that would have been enough to say</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.490" end="01:50:56.080" style="s2">the neoliberal story is over so I think</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.280" end="01:50:59.800" style="s2">there was that fear that this was coming</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.080" end="01:51:02.140" style="s2">to an end my sense of it was that the</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.800" end="01:51:04.420" style="s2">major reaction to Trump was sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.140" end="01:51:08.430" style="s2">class reaction that it was you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.420" end="01:51:11.200" style="s2">rejecting the entire concept of a an</p>

<p begin="01:51:13.810" end="01:51:18.220" style="s2">clearly sort of not the kind of person</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.450" end="01:51:19.090" style="s2">who should be in the Oval Office much</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.220" end="01:51:21.579" style="s2">more than</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.090" end="01:51:23.559" style="s2">the issue of whether or not Trump was</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.579" end="01:51:25.329" style="s2">going to be a war monger turned the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.559" end="01:51:27.219" style="s2">into a police state which of course</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.329" end="01:51:31.809" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to have happened as of this</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.219" end="01:51:34.179" style="s2">moment in 2019 yes yes but I guess what</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.809" end="01:51:36.429" style="s2">my sense of it was is that people really</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.179" end="01:51:39.010" style="s2">were shocked I was because I live in a</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.429" end="01:51:40.239" style="s2">left-of-center universe the day after</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.010" end="01:51:42.909" style="s2">they certainly pretended to be shocked</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.239" end="01:51:44.440" style="s2">no there&#39;s no IIIi look I&#39;ll concede</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.909" end="01:51:47.110" style="s2">your point they were they were pretty</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.440" end="01:51:50.110" style="s2">shocked they were shocked but you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.110" end="01:51:52.059" style="s2">if but I still have my question why were</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.110" end="01:51:55.110" style="s2">they clicking on the national interest a</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.059" end="01:51:58.599" style="s2">few times a day one version of it was</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.110" end="01:51:59.800" style="s2">let&#39;s say even if Hillary trounced Trump</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.599" end="01:52:01.659" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t enough that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.800" end="01:52:03.699" style="s2">scary thing given what Trump had been</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.659" end="01:52:06.219" style="s2">built up to which is a you know orange</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.699" end="01:52:07.900" style="s2">Hitler you know if you imagine that your</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.219" end="01:52:10.960" style="s2">country is supporting somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.900" end="01:52:12.670" style="s2">thinks all Mexicans are rapists and is</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.960" end="01:52:16.030" style="s2">going to take the country back to you</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.670" end="01:52:17.860" style="s2">know to the Middle Ages it would be very</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.030" end="01:52:20.739" style="s2">disconcerting if such a person could get</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.860" end="01:52:26.079" style="s2">20% of the vote so I think that the poll</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.739" end="01:52:30.670" style="s2">had his own significance however you</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.079" end="01:52:33.010" style="s2">know I I think that one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.670" end="01:52:35.230" style="s2">about preference falsification is is</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.010" end="01:52:38.440" style="s2">that when you start to believe that this</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.230" end="01:52:40.090" style="s2">is a robust phenomenon that all of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.440" end="01:52:41.530" style="s2">economic models that assume that your</p>

<p begin="01:52:41.530" end="01:52:47.230" style="s2">preferences are the same you start to</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.190" end="01:52:48.880" style="s2">see the world very differently and so</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.230" end="01:52:50.619" style="s2">this is one of the portals into an</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.880" end="01:52:53.730" style="s2">alternate way of seeing the universe so</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.619" end="01:52:57.760" style="s2">as not to get surprised by revolutions</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.730" end="01:53:00.099" style="s2">well it&#39;s always um you know it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.760" end="01:53:02.440" style="s2">this question on in my mind this</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.099" end="01:53:05.050" style="s2">question of preference falsification the</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.440" end="01:53:07.809" style="s2">two McCrone theories tightly coupled to</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.050" end="01:53:10.020" style="s2">this question of you know how intense is</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.809" end="01:53:13.960" style="s2">the problem of political correctness</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.020" end="01:53:16.210" style="s2">where how how much pressure is there on</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.960" end="01:53:21.699" style="s2">people to say things they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.210" end="01:53:23.710" style="s2">believe and and and I you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.699" end="01:53:25.480" style="s2">always come back to thinking that the</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.710" end="01:53:27.099" style="s2">problem of political correctness in some</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.480" end="01:53:29.320" style="s2">sense is our biggest political problem</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.099" end="01:53:32.440" style="s2">that that you know we live in a world</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.320" end="01:53:34.360" style="s2">where people are super uncomfortable say</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.440" end="01:53:36.310" style="s2">what they think that it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.360" end="01:53:40.570" style="s2">dangerous to use you use the Silicon</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.310" end="01:53:42.310" style="s2">Valley context um it&#39;s a problem that</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.570" end="01:53:44.920" style="s2">Silicon Valley has become a one-party</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.310" end="01:53:46.480" style="s2">state but there are two different senses</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.920" end="01:53:48.730" style="s2">in which you can be a one-party state</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.480" end="01:53:51.489" style="s2">one sense is that everybody just happens</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.730" end="01:53:56.260" style="s2">to believe this one thing which you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.489" end="01:53:58.150" style="s2">um you know is one thing and then the</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.260" end="01:53:59.730" style="s2">other one is in which 85% of people</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.150" end="01:54:02.770" style="s2">believe one thing and the other 15%</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.730" end="01:54:05.020" style="s2">pretend to and you know it&#39;s for like a</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.770" end="01:54:07.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a dynamic with super majorities</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.020" end="01:54:08.260" style="s2">where you know we is in a democracy we</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.120" end="01:54:09.699" style="s2">think fifty-one percent of people</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.260" end="01:54:11.890" style="s2">believe something they&#39;re probably right</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.699" end="01:54:14.260" style="s2">if 70 to 80 percent believe something</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.890" end="01:54:15.370" style="s2">it&#39;s almost more certainly right but if</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.260" end="01:54:17.530" style="s2">you have ninety-nine point nine nine</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.370" end="01:54:19.590" style="s2">percent of the people believe something</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.530" end="01:54:22.360" style="s2">at some point you shifted from</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.590" end="01:54:25.210" style="s2">democratic truth to North Korean and</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.360" end="01:54:26.949" style="s2">sanity and and so there is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.210" end="01:54:31.540" style="s2">subtle tipping point where the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.949" end="01:54:34.540" style="s2">crowds shifts into into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.540" end="01:54:37.180" style="s2">sort of softly totalitarian or something</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.540" end="01:54:39.100" style="s2">like that so in my mind it maps you know</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.180" end="01:54:40.870" style="s2">very much on to this this question of</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.100" end="01:54:42.489" style="s2">you know the problem of political</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.870" end="01:54:45.489" style="s2">correctness it&#39;s always hard to measure</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.489" end="01:54:46.870" style="s2">how how big it is you know politically</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.489" end="01:54:48.219" style="s2">correct society of course you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.870" end="01:54:51.550" style="s2">just saying what we think we all love</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.219" end="01:54:53.140" style="s2">stalling we all of chairman mao and and</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.550" end="01:54:54.969" style="s2">maybe you know we&#39;re just singing these</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.140" end="01:54:58.390" style="s2">songs because we&#39;re all enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.969" end="01:55:00.130" style="s2">about it and and i think my read on it</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.390" end="01:55:02.440" style="s2">is that that&#39;s that problem has gotten</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.130" end="01:55:05.050" style="s2">more acute in a lot of parts of our</p>

<p begin="01:55:05.050" end="01:55:11.219" style="s2">think that&#39;s gotten well as you know I</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.650" end="01:55:14.920" style="s2">started this whole intellectual darkweb</p>

<p begin="01:56:00.100" end="01:56:04.900" style="s2">dangerous truths so for example if you</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.830" end="01:56:08.800" style="s2">believe that IQ equals intelligence</p>

<p begin="01:56:10.390" end="01:56:17.620" style="s2">you&#39;re going to fear anything that shows</p>

<p begin="01:56:17.620" end="01:56:21.520" style="s2">don&#39;t believe IQ equals intelligence if</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.930" end="01:56:24.910" style="s2">you believe that intelligence is a much</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.520" end="01:56:26.560" style="s2">richer story and that no group is that</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.910" end="01:56:28.750" style="s2">far out of the running you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.560" end="01:56:30.969" style="s2">terribly frightened of the data because</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.750" end="01:56:33.070" style="s2">you have lots of different ways of</p>

<p begin="01:56:33.070" end="01:56:38.320" style="s2">you generally find that the truth is the</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.170" end="01:56:40.989" style="s2">best way of lifting people out of their</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.320" end="01:56:42.520" style="s2">situation so I secretly suspect to be</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.989" end="01:56:44.500" style="s2">blunt about and this is kind of horrible</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.520" end="01:56:47.110" style="s2">that a lot of Silicon Valley is</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.500" end="01:56:50.350" style="s2">extremely bigoted and misogynistic and</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.110" end="01:56:52.840" style="s2">it can&#39;t actually make eye contact with</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.350" end="01:56:54.250" style="s2">the fact that it secretly thinks women</p>

<p begin="01:57:08.350" end="01:57:12.310" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t actually worry too much</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.630" end="01:57:14.560" style="s2">about an intellectual difference you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.310" end="01:57:16.180" style="s2">be willing to have an intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.560" end="01:57:18.730" style="s2">conversation that was quite open about</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.180" end="01:57:20.620" style="s2">it so maybe I can turn that around is it</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.730" end="01:57:21.910" style="s2">yeah I let me see there&#39;s sort of a lot</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.620" end="01:57:25.390" style="s2">of different things I want to react to</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.910" end="01:57:28.140" style="s2">there I um yeah I suspect that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.390" end="01:57:31.150" style="s2">a distraction of sorts you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.140" end="01:57:33.520" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m this very superficial layer</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.150" end="01:57:35.110" style="s2">and we want to have we want to have</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.520" end="01:57:38.440" style="s2">debates when I&#39;ve debates in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.110" end="01:57:40.150" style="s2">areas a lot of you know hard questions</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.440" end="01:57:42.820" style="s2">and their questions in science and</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.150" end="01:57:44.080" style="s2">technology and philosophy religion</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.820" end="01:57:46.000" style="s2">they&#39;re all these questions I think it</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.080" end="01:57:48.160" style="s2">would be healthy to debate and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.000" end="01:57:50.230" style="s2">way in which political debates are sort</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.160" end="01:57:52.390" style="s2">of a low form of these questions and</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.230" end="01:57:55.239" style="s2">there&#39;s one sense in which I think of</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.390" end="01:57:58.480" style="s2">these political questions as less</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.239" end="01:57:59.659" style="s2">important or less elevated and some of</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.480" end="01:58:01.850" style="s2">these others</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.659" end="01:58:04.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a sense in which these</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.850" end="01:58:08.540" style="s2">questions about politics are ones that</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.520" end="01:58:11.300" style="s2">that everyone can have access to and so</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.540" end="01:58:13.790" style="s2">if you can&#39;t even have a debate about</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.300" end="01:58:15.920" style="s2">politics you can&#39;t say you know I like</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.790" end="01:58:19.760" style="s2">the man with a strange orange hairdo or</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.920" end="01:58:22.219" style="s2">I like the mean grandmother yeah um if</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.760" end="01:58:24.350" style="s2">you can&#39;t even say that then then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.219" end="01:58:25.760" style="s2">sort of frozen out discussion on a lot</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.350" end="01:58:28.429" style="s2">of other areas and that&#39;s that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.760" end="01:58:31.250" style="s2">one of the reasons I think the that that</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.429" end="01:58:33.440" style="s2">political correctness starts with</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.250" end="01:58:35.510" style="s2">correctness about politics and the</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.440" end="01:58:36.860" style="s2">that&#39;s it this time when you that when</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.510" end="01:58:39.530" style="s2">you aren&#39;t allowed to talk about that</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.860" end="01:58:41.719" style="s2">area you implicitly frozen out a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.530" end="01:58:44.239" style="s2">others that are maybe more important and</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.719" end="01:58:45.260" style="s2">you know and we&#39;re you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.239" end="01:58:46.969" style="s2">certainly not gonna have a debate about</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.260" end="01:58:48.710" style="s2">string theory if we can&#39;t even have a</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.969" end="01:58:51.380" style="s2">common sense debate about politics or</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.710" end="01:58:54.199" style="s2">something like that um you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.380" end="01:58:57.860" style="s2">it&#39;s I&#39;m I&#39;m very sympathetic to the</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.199" end="01:59:02.090" style="s2">sort of distraction theory that that you</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.860" end="01:59:03.760" style="s2">know a lot of these sort of that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.090" end="01:59:07.400" style="s2">going on our society is like a</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.760" end="01:59:09.530" style="s2">psychosocial magic hypnotic magic trick</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.400" end="01:59:11.239" style="s2">where you know we&#39;re being distracted</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.530" end="01:59:13.340" style="s2">from from something something very</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.239" end="01:59:15.620" style="s2">important and political correctness</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.340" end="01:59:17.570" style="s2">identity politics in maybe American</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.620" end="01:59:20.750" style="s2">exceptionalism sort of these these</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.570" end="01:59:22.730" style="s2">various ideological systems on you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.750" end="01:59:25.070" style="s2">are distracting us from things the the</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.730" end="01:59:26.510" style="s2">you know the thing I keep thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.070" end="01:59:28.940" style="s2">the main thing is distracting us from is</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.510" end="01:59:30.260" style="s2">the stagnation and is that you know that</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.940" end="01:59:32.210" style="s2">there are these problems that that we</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.260" end="01:59:34.250" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk about in our society</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.210" end="01:59:35.989" style="s2">it&#39;s possible it&#39;s also a way to</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.250" end="01:59:38.630" style="s2">distract us from bad thoughts that we</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.989" end="01:59:40.670" style="s2">have about people or the sword use you</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.630" end="01:59:42.230" style="s2">said but the one I would go back to</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.670" end="01:59:44.929" style="s2">first is just that it&#39;s distracting us</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.230" end="01:59:46.400" style="s2">from dealing with dealing with problems</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.929" end="01:59:48.170" style="s2">you know the reason the reason we have a</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.400" end="01:59:50.020" style="s2">new speak the sort of Orwellian Newspeak</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.170" end="01:59:52.400" style="s2">and politics with these zombie</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.020" end="01:59:55.370" style="s2">politicians and you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.400" end="01:59:58.100" style="s2">Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush or whoever</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.370" end="01:59:59.690" style="s2">it might might be is that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.100" end="02:00:01.460" style="s2">supposed to talk about the real issues</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.690" end="02:00:03.080" style="s2">and maybe they have a bad conscience and</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.460" end="02:00:05.090" style="s2">I think they&#39;re bad people but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.080" end="02:00:06.980" style="s2">I think the primary thing is just too</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.090" end="02:00:08.330" style="s2">dangerous to talk about what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.980" end="02:00:10.670" style="s2">going on they don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.330" end="02:00:12.469" style="s2">about it and better not talk about that</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.670" end="02:00:12.909" style="s2">yeah I think there&#39;s another take on it</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.469" end="02:00:15.159" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.909" end="02:00:16.929" style="s2">you know if I&#39;m honest about it it</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.159" end="02:00:20.670" style="s2">probably originates from my side of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.929" end="02:00:23.500" style="s2">aisle which is that I have a sense that</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.670" end="02:00:25.300" style="s2">if you believe that productivity and</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.500" end="02:00:27.550" style="s2">growth is over you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.300" end="02:00:28.780" style="s2">emphasize issues of Merit because you</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.550" end="02:00:31.510" style="s2">don&#39;t really think that the merit is</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.780" end="02:00:34.120" style="s2">gonna translate and so therefore all you</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.510" end="02:00:37.060" style="s2">can focus on like you know a board of a</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.120" end="02:00:38.800" style="s2">company is just a bunch of slots at a</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.060" end="02:00:40.870" style="s2">trough and so you have to make sure that</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.800" end="02:00:42.820" style="s2">every group has its slots at the trough</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.870" end="02:00:44.560" style="s2">right because it doesn&#39;t actually matter</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.820" end="02:00:46.330" style="s2">the board isn&#39;t doing anything to begin</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.560" end="02:00:48.489" style="s2">with and so it&#39;s only a question of</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.330" end="02:00:52.179" style="s2">receiving the wealth that is already</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.489" end="02:00:53.980" style="s2">there and so I worry that that is you</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.179" end="02:00:55.719" style="s2">know I guess where I break with a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.980" end="02:00:58.420" style="s2">progressives is that I believe that most</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.719" end="02:01:00.909" style="s2">progress comes from progress rights</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.420" end="02:01:02.350" style="s2">technologically led and informational II</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.909" end="02:01:04.510" style="s2">led that the more we know and the more</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.350" end="02:01:07.480" style="s2">we can do the more we can take care of</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.510" end="02:01:12.929" style="s2">people yes I I mean again this is always</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.480" end="02:01:15.280" style="s2">maybe naive hope on my part or or um or</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.929" end="02:01:16.960" style="s2">something like this but I always think</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.280" end="02:01:18.969" style="s2">that when we can&#39;t talk about things</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.960" end="02:01:21.070" style="s2">yeah I can&#39;t solve them and and that</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.969" end="02:01:23.199" style="s2">this is exactly and so that maybe these</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.070" end="02:01:24.520" style="s2">are maybe these are the calculations you</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.199" end="02:01:26.500" style="s2">make and this is you know this is the</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.520" end="02:01:27.790" style="s2">way we Pat people on the head even</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.500" end="02:01:30.940" style="s2">though they&#39;re never gonna get ahead or</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.790" end="02:01:35.560" style="s2">something like that but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.940" end="02:01:36.460" style="s2">never going to work it&#39;s people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.560" end="02:01:38.770" style="s2">that stupid and they will eventually</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.460" end="02:01:41.199" style="s2">figure it out and so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.770" end="02:01:44.230" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of why I&#39;m under motivated</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.199" end="02:01:45.429" style="s2">to play that game yeah and I have to say</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.230" end="02:01:48.340" style="s2">that one of the things that I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.429" end="02:01:49.960" style="s2">from you is that it&#39;s one thing to hold</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.340" end="02:01:52.270" style="s2">it have a contrarian position it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.960" end="02:01:55.590" style="s2">another thing to hold it when the whole</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.270" end="02:01:58.350" style="s2">world starts hating on you for example I</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.590" end="02:02:01.750" style="s2">watched the world go from viewing</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.350" end="02:02:04.260" style="s2">removing Gawker as removing a nuisance</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.750" end="02:02:11.969" style="s2">or worse that was threatening people</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.260" end="02:02:11.969" style="s2">selectively to a concern you know about</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.010" end="02:02:18.760" style="s2">like First Amendment rights and</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.480" end="02:02:21.010" style="s2">silencing you know free speech and you</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.760" end="02:02:27.239" style="s2">know III do have the strong sense that</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.010" end="02:02:30.159" style="s2">people are willfully misinterpreting</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.239" end="02:02:32.469" style="s2">these actions that are necessary to sort</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.159" end="02:02:35.320" style="s2">of self correct in our society and are</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.469" end="02:02:38.320" style="s2">not being terribly honest there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.320" end="02:02:40.510" style="s2">of bad faith acting and in our system at</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.320" end="02:02:42.010" style="s2">the moment yeah but you know again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.510" end="02:02:43.949" style="s2">always I&#39;m always like this again where</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.010" end="02:02:45.880" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m always quite hopeful that people</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.949" end="02:02:47.380" style="s2">realize there&#39;s a lot of bad faith</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.880" end="02:02:49.360" style="s2">acting and they they you know they just</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.380" end="02:02:51.789" style="s2">can&#39;t like go out of it accordingly and</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.360" end="02:02:53.469" style="s2">I you know um you know I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.789" end="02:02:56.949" style="s2">how many of the people disagree with me</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.469" end="02:02:59.230" style="s2">on the the support for Trump you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.949" end="02:03:02.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll be more open to it in five years</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.230" end="02:03:04.690" style="s2">or ten years and we&#39;ll see on the Gawker</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.440" end="02:03:08.170" style="s2">matter I&#39;m you know I&#39;m gonna win that</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.690" end="02:03:10.840" style="s2">one and and I think that you know I</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.170" end="02:03:13.630" style="s2">think people understand that when it</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.840" end="02:03:16.929" style="s2">gets criticized by people in the media</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.630" end="02:03:19.090" style="s2">who have themselves are up against super</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.929" end="02:03:21.130" style="s2">challenged business models right they</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.090" end="02:03:23.650" style="s2">have to act in sociopathic ways to get</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.130" end="02:03:25.329" style="s2">clicks by their readers right that this</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.650" end="02:03:30.219" style="s2">is just the game they have to play I</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.329" end="02:03:32.889" style="s2">think people I agree than you think and</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.219" end="02:03:36.219" style="s2">uh and therefore you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.889" end="02:03:37.929" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite what it what it looks</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.219" end="02:03:39.760" style="s2">well but but there&#39;s also a way in which</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.929" end="02:03:41.590" style="s2">boat in both of these cases there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.760" end="02:03:44.349" style="s2">nothing I think I was I was extremely</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.590" end="02:03:45.880" style="s2">disturbed by Gawker a decade decade and</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.349" end="02:03:48.309" style="s2">a half ago because I think it was a</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.880" end="02:03:50.920" style="s2">really powerful thing at the time where</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.309" end="02:03:52.059" style="s2">it worked because people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.920" end="02:03:54.309" style="s2">understand how it worked it was this</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.059" end="02:03:57.400" style="s2">hate factory the scapegoating machine</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.309" end="02:03:59.949" style="s2">but people didn&#39;t see it as such um and</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.400" end="02:04:02.019" style="s2">because of that it was it was super</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.949" end="02:04:04.030" style="s2">powerful once you you know once you see</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.019" end="02:04:06.849" style="s2">how it works once you understand it it</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.030" end="02:04:09.869" style="s2">is it is less powerful so you know even</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.849" end="02:04:13.630" style="s2">you know had I not succeeded in in</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.869" end="02:04:15.429" style="s2">litigation again against Gawker I think</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.630" end="02:04:17.349" style="s2">it would be a weaker version of that</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.429" end="02:04:18.820" style="s2">today because and you know there are of</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.349" end="02:04:20.590" style="s2">course equally nasty things on the</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.820" end="02:04:22.750" style="s2">internet but they&#39;re not as powerful</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.590" end="02:04:24.939" style="s2">because a little well-organized people</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.750" end="02:04:26.860" style="s2">people can sort of us the</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.939" end="02:04:28.449" style="s2">there&#39;s more transparency into them into</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.860" end="02:04:30.639" style="s2">the bad motives and people get it and</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.449" end="02:04:33.130" style="s2">the hate factory only works when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.639" end="02:04:34.719" style="s2">not perceived as such well I think that</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.130" end="02:04:36.550" style="s2">there is a way in which some of this</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.719" end="02:04:40.030" style="s2">stuff is slowing down because people are</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.550" end="02:04:44.169" style="s2">getting tired of the constant state of</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.030" end="02:04:46.059" style="s2">beheading figuratively of people via</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.169" end="02:04:48.669" style="s2">their reputation that we&#39;ve moved from</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.059" end="02:04:50.499" style="s2">honest physical violence into</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.669" end="02:04:52.449" style="s2">reputational and economic violence</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.499" end="02:04:53.889" style="s2">against people that are considered</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.449" end="02:04:56.289" style="s2">undesirable but I think that like</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.889" end="02:04:58.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a story with both Gawker and</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.289" end="02:05:01.449" style="s2">Trump which the rest of the world will</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.539" end="02:05:04.150" style="s2">never see and I wouldn&#39;t have seen it if</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.449" end="02:05:06.010" style="s2">I hadn&#39;t been working with you in the</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.150" end="02:05:08.469" style="s2">case of Gawker I don&#39;t think anybody</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.010" end="02:05:11.739" style="s2">even knows the story about how much you</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.469" end="02:05:13.360" style="s2">sweated the ethics internally of how do</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.739" end="02:05:15.130" style="s2">I do this right how do I make sure that</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.360" end="02:05:16.929" style="s2">I don&#39;t hurt anybody that I shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.130" end="02:05:18.639" style="s2">hurting how do I make sure that this</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.929" end="02:05:21.579" style="s2">represents something narrow and not</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.639" end="02:05:23.439" style="s2">something broad which is the story so</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.579" end="02:05:25.449" style="s2">far as I know that hasn&#39;t been told and</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.439" end="02:05:30.849" style="s2">then there&#39;s the story with Trump where</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.449" end="02:05:33.269" style="s2">I few remember this when Trump won you</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.849" end="02:05:38.019" style="s2">had a gathering at your house and you</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.269" end="02:05:41.889" style="s2">did not invite me and I was so pissed at</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.019" end="02:05:44.409" style="s2">you that even though I was tooth and</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.889" end="02:05:48.400" style="s2">nail against Trump and I remain really</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.409" end="02:05:50.380" style="s2">pretty close to a never Trump er I knew</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.400" end="02:05:52.179" style="s2">why you did what you did I knew that you</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.380" end="02:05:55.030" style="s2">felt that it was a reduction in violence</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.179" end="02:05:56.889" style="s2">and I think that you had theories that</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.030" end="02:05:58.269" style="s2">nobody believed at the time if I look</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.889" end="02:06:01.539" style="s2">out at this world F through these</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.269" end="02:06:04.119" style="s2">windows Trump has not changed mostly day</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.539" end="02:06:06.429" style="s2">to day life except for the phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.119" end="02:06:08.919" style="s2">Trump but it&#39;s it&#39;s no there&#39;s the gate</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.429" end="02:06:11.829" style="s2">you know a policeman on every street</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.919" end="02:06:14.949" style="s2">corner with a an automatic rifle we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.829" end="02:06:17.679" style="s2">not in some sort of siege from the White</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.949" end="02:06:19.300" style="s2">House and you said I think much less is</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.679" end="02:06:20.439" style="s2">going to happen than people imagine and</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.300" end="02:06:23.199" style="s2">I think we&#39;re going to be in a much less</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.439" end="02:06:25.030" style="s2">interventionist mode then we were</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.199" end="02:06:26.650" style="s2">previously and whether or not you were</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.030" end="02:06:27.789" style="s2">right or you&#39;re wrong so far I think</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.650" end="02:06:31.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve been borne out to be right on</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.789" end="02:06:33.849" style="s2">both of those points I knew that you had</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.570" end="02:06:36.249" style="s2">an idea that we had to shake things up</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.849" end="02:06:37.929" style="s2">or we were going to be in some very</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.249" end="02:06:41.710" style="s2">dangerous situation there was</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.929" end="02:06:43.449" style="s2">I mean I had two speeches in 2016 one</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.710" end="02:06:45.130" style="s2">was at the Republican convention one was</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.449" end="02:06:47.770" style="s2">at the Washington Press Club about a</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.130" end="02:06:51.010" style="s2">month before the election and in in both</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.770" end="02:06:52.420" style="s2">speeches I you know I underscored the</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.010" end="02:06:54.550" style="s2">ways in which I think Trump would</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.420" end="02:06:56.350" style="s2">represent a break from the</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.550" end="02:06:58.870" style="s2">interventionist neoconservative</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.350" end="02:07:02.260" style="s2">neoliberal foreign policies of you know</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.870" end="02:07:04.750" style="s2">on that you know Bush 43 that Obama</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.260" end="02:07:07.360" style="s2">still continued and that Hillary was was</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.750" end="02:07:13.420" style="s2">likely to can been likely to continue on</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.360" end="02:07:15.250" style="s2">and and I still think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.420" end="02:07:19.330" style="s2">roughly what&#39;s happened it&#39;s not been</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.250" end="02:07:21.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not been as far away from</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.330" end="02:07:23.350" style="s2">interventionism as I would like but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.370" end="02:07:27.760" style="s2">directionally directionally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.350" end="02:07:29.949" style="s2">happened and I think and I think that</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.760" end="02:07:31.480" style="s2">you know I do think we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.949" end="02:07:33.429" style="s2">go back to that on the Republican side</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.480" end="02:07:35.170" style="s2">which is like a very important thing</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.429" end="02:07:37.480" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to go back to the Bush</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.170" end="02:07:39.429" style="s2">foreign policy ever yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.480" end="02:07:42.880" style="s2">in him that&#39;s that that was an important</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.429" end="02:07:45.390" style="s2">thing you know it was it was when when</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.880" end="02:07:47.980" style="s2">in the in the primaries when you know</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.390" end="02:07:50.080" style="s2">publican primaries when when Trump spoke</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.980" end="02:07:51.250" style="s2">out against the Iraq war right that was</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.080" end="02:07:53.530" style="s2">you know that was a very important</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.250" end="02:07:54.940" style="s2">moment for my point of view yeah and I</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.530" end="02:07:57.310" style="s2">think you know I think you know we</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.940" end="02:07:58.690" style="s2">always think of the you know I think the</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.310" end="02:08:00.670" style="s2">way one way to think of the president</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.690" end="02:08:02.409" style="s2">United States is that you&#39;re sort of the</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.670" end="02:08:04.510" style="s2">mayor of this country and but you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.409" end="02:08:06.610" style="s2">dictator of the world because in the</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.510" end="02:08:09.340" style="s2">u.s. your power is very limited outside</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.610" end="02:08:10.929" style="s2">the US you can do a you know a great</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.340" end="02:08:12.940" style="s2">number of things and that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.929" end="02:08:16.420" style="s2">these these foreign policy questions are</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.940" end="02:08:22.800" style="s2">actually are very important ones in</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.420" end="02:08:26.440" style="s2">assessing a president well may I guess</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.800" end="02:08:29.590" style="s2">my my take on the great danger of Trump</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.440" end="02:08:32.560" style="s2">was that there were certain sorts of</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.590" end="02:08:34.659" style="s2">standards and agreed-upon cultural</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.560" end="02:08:36.130" style="s2">aspects which I&#39;ve likened to the oral</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.659" end="02:08:39.610" style="s2">torah of the United States where the</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.130" end="02:08:43.420" style="s2">Constitution is our written Torah and my</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.610" end="02:08:48.280" style="s2">concern is that Trump has had an effect</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.420" end="02:08:51.110" style="s2">on degrading certain expectations where</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.280" end="02:08:52.670" style="s2">it does matter how one comports oneself</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.110" end="02:08:54.590" style="s2">the president maybe not as much as some</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.670" end="02:08:56.119" style="s2">of my friends would like to think and I</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.590" end="02:08:58.310" style="s2">do think that we needed some dynamism</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.119" end="02:09:01.130" style="s2">but my concern is is that it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.310" end="02:09:04.699" style="s2">very difficult to recover from the kind</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.130" end="02:09:09.020" style="s2">of damage to our sense of what can and</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.699" end="02:09:10.460" style="s2">cannot be said and done not that I did</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.020" end="02:09:12.679" style="s2">think I did think that we needed to</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.460" end="02:09:14.929" style="s2">break out of our Overton Window if you</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.679" end="02:09:17.150" style="s2">will on many topics I was just the way</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.929" end="02:09:21.170" style="s2">that Trump touched those whereas not</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.150" end="02:09:24.199" style="s2">comfortable for me yes look I don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.170" end="02:09:25.760" style="s2">yeah I agree there are certain ways in</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.199" end="02:09:27.739" style="s2">which President Trump does not act</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.760" end="02:09:30.320" style="s2">presidential in the way in which the</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.739" end="02:09:31.969" style="s2">previous presidents inarguable things</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.320" end="02:09:33.590" style="s2">that need it and then maybe said but</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.969" end="02:09:36.290" style="s2">then maybe there&#39;s some point where it</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.590" end="02:09:38.300" style="s2">was too much acting and the acting was</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.290" end="02:09:42.380" style="s2">counterproductive and that&#39;s that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.300" end="02:09:46.040" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s III I think there is</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.380" end="02:09:48.440" style="s2">something extraordinary about how it was</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.040" end="02:09:52.699" style="s2">possible for someone like Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.440" end="02:09:56.300" style="s2">to get elected and and probably a useful</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.699" end="02:09:58.250" style="s2">question for people on both the left and</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.300" end="02:09:59.090" style="s2">the right would be to to try to think</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.250" end="02:10:01.580" style="s2">about you know what the underlying</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.090" end="02:10:05.989" style="s2">problems were with some of the solutions</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.580" end="02:10:08.750" style="s2">to that are and and you know it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.989" end="02:10:10.699" style="s2">know I think I think I think the the</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.750" end="02:10:12.170" style="s2">left or the Democrats you know they</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.699" end="02:10:15.170" style="s2">could think it they can win they can win</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.170" end="02:10:17.540" style="s2">in 2020 but they have to have more of an</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.170" end="02:10:19.130" style="s2">agenda than just telling the Republicans</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.540" end="02:10:20.510" style="s2">to hurry up and die well this has to be</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.130" end="02:10:22.489" style="s2">more than that this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.510" end="02:10:25.010" style="s2">convinced me that I didn&#39;t get the Trump</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.489" end="02:10:26.659" style="s2">thing which was I was convinced that</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.010" end="02:10:29.179" style="s2">Trump was gonna be such a wake up call</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.659" end="02:10:31.909" style="s2">that the Democratic Party was gonna you</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.179" end="02:10:33.530" style="s2">know go behind a closed door and say we</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.909" end="02:10:35.600" style="s2">cannot let this happen again we have to</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.530" end="02:10:37.280" style="s2">look honestly at how we got beaten what</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.600" end="02:10:38.389" style="s2">this represents what it means and what</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.280" end="02:10:40.639" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do next time</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.389" end="02:10:42.530" style="s2">and the idea that we were going to</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.639" end="02:10:44.000" style="s2">double or triple down on some of the</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.530" end="02:10:46.760" style="s2">stuff that didn&#39;t work never even</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.000" end="02:10:51.469" style="s2">occurred to me I had no idea that that</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.760" end="02:10:53.239" style="s2">party was so far gone that it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.469" end="02:10:55.369" style="s2">actually you know if you imagine that</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.239" end="02:10:56.989" style="s2">he&#39;s orange Hitler you would think</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.369" end="02:10:59.090" style="s2">orange Hitler would be the occasion to</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.989" end="02:11:00.409" style="s2">think deeply in question hypotheses and</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.090" end="02:11:02.480" style="s2">I really had been shocked at the extent</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.409" end="02:11:05.510" style="s2">to which that didn&#39;t happen so maybe I</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.480" end="02:11:07.070" style="s2">got my own party wrong on that front I</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.510" end="02:11:10.909" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that we were this far gone</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.070" end="02:11:14.599" style="s2">but ya know it&#39;s it&#39;s I think this feels</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.909" end="02:11:17.030" style="s2">a lot of time to to do that and I keep</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.599" end="02:11:19.060" style="s2">thinking that you know we are at some</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.030" end="02:11:21.800" style="s2">point where where the distractions</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.060" end="02:11:25.790" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to work as well and I think</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.800" end="02:11:27.800" style="s2">the the the big distraction on on the</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.790" end="02:11:30.469" style="s2">left over the last 40 50 years have come</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.800" end="02:11:31.909" style="s2">in forms of identity politics where you</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.469" end="02:11:35.030" style="s2">know we we don&#39;t look at the country as</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.909" end="02:11:37.429" style="s2">a whole we look at parts of it and and</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.030" end="02:11:39.770" style="s2">sort of it on it and it&#39;s sort of been a</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.429" end="02:11:43.820" style="s2">way of you know um I think obscuring</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.770" end="02:11:46.639" style="s2">these questions of stagnation Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.820" end="02:11:50.840" style="s2">had a right I would say the right the</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.639" end="02:11:52.400" style="s2">right wing distraction technique has</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.840" end="02:11:53.929" style="s2">been a would say something like American</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.400" end="02:11:56.960" style="s2">exceptionalism which is interesting</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.929" end="02:11:59.960" style="s2">which is you know this doctrine that the</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.960" end="02:12:04.250" style="s2">u.s. is this singular exceptional</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.960" end="02:12:06.320" style="s2">country it&#39;s so so terrific so wonderful</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.250" end="02:12:08.780" style="s2">it does everything so incredibly well</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.320" end="02:12:11.719" style="s2">that you shouldn&#39;t ask any any difficult</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.780" end="02:12:14.300" style="s2">questions any questions at all and you</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.719" end="02:12:16.429" style="s2">know it&#39;s if you want the it&#39;s it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.300" end="02:12:18.830" style="s2">think it in theological or</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.429" end="02:12:21.560" style="s2">epistemological terms you can compare it</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.830" end="02:12:24.610" style="s2">to the radical monotheism of the God of</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.560" end="02:12:27.409" style="s2">the Old Testament where um it means that</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.610" end="02:12:29.510" style="s2">God is so radically unique that you</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.409" end="02:12:32.000" style="s2">can&#39;t know anything about him you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.510" end="02:12:33.560" style="s2">talk about God&#39;s attributes you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.000" end="02:12:35.750" style="s2">you know say anything about him</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.560" end="02:12:38.570" style="s2">whatsoever and if the United States is</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.750" end="02:12:40.340" style="s2">radically exceptional then in a similar</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.570" end="02:12:42.710" style="s2">way you can say nothing about it</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.340" end="02:12:44.030" style="s2">whatsoever and there may be all these</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.710" end="02:12:45.739" style="s2">things on the ground that seem crazy</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.030" end="02:12:47.179" style="s2">we&#39;re you know we you know we have</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.739" end="02:12:49.550" style="s2">people who are exceptionally overweight</p>
<p begin="02:12:47.179" end="02:12:51.590" style="s2">we have we have subway systems that are</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.550" end="02:12:54.010" style="s2">exceptionally expensive to build we have</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.590" end="02:12:55.610" style="s2">universities they&#39;re exceptionally</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.010" end="02:12:57.199" style="s2">sociopathic I mean you know of the</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.610" end="02:12:59.929" style="s2">student debt problem any other country</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.199" end="02:13:02.150" style="s2">on you know we have a trade regime</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.929" end="02:13:04.360" style="s2">that&#39;s exceptionally bad for our country</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.150" end="02:13:06.650" style="s2">like no other country is</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.360" end="02:13:09.199" style="s2">self-destructive this they&#39;re all these</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.650" end="02:13:11.929" style="s2">things that we somehow don&#39;t ask us I</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.199" end="02:13:14.619" style="s2">think exceptionalism</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.929" end="02:13:17.099" style="s2">somehow led to this country that was</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.619" end="02:13:20.429" style="s2">exceptionally</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.099" end="02:13:23.760" style="s2">and strange and that&#39;s uh that&#39;s um and</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.429" end="02:13:25.920" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s you know greatness</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.760" end="02:13:27.869" style="s2">is adjacent to exceptionalism but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.920" end="02:13:31.619" style="s2">actually still quite different because</p>
<p begin="02:13:27.869" end="02:13:33.989" style="s2">many countries can be great and great is</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.619" end="02:13:35.790" style="s2">more it&#39;s more a scale and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.989" end="02:13:38.340" style="s2">something you measure it against multi</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.790" end="02:13:40.619" style="s2">an area it&#39;s where as exceptional it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.340" end="02:13:43.829" style="s2">just completely and commensurate with</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.619" end="02:13:45.929" style="s2">anything else and and and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.829" end="02:13:49.650" style="s2">that&#39;s gotten us into have very very bad</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.929" end="02:13:51.329" style="s2">cool to sack night I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.650" end="02:13:53.340" style="s2">a way in which that sort of</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.329" end="02:13:56.000" style="s2">exceptionalism has ended on the right</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.340" end="02:13:58.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s been we&#39;ve moved beyond that</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.000" end="02:14:00.210" style="s2">and I&#39;m hopeful that in a similar way</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.560" end="02:14:03.119" style="s2">the left will move beyond identity</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.210" end="02:14:04.980" style="s2">politics even though you know right now</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.119" end="02:14:07.079" style="s2">it feels like the monster is flopping</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.980" end="02:14:08.310" style="s2">about more violently than ever and even</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.079" end="02:14:10.590" style="s2">though I think it might be its death</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.310" end="02:14:12.389" style="s2">throes but maybe not yeah it could be</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.590" end="02:14:13.860" style="s2">that it&#39;s gotten very strong or it could</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.389" end="02:14:17.579" style="s2">be on its last legs and it might as well</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.860" end="02:14:20.369" style="s2">go for broke yes so let me return back</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.579" end="02:14:22.739" style="s2">to the the line of inquiry I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.369" end="02:14:24.060" style="s2">sorry I just enjoying so much hearing</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.739" end="02:14:28.139" style="s2">what you have to say some of its new to</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.060" end="02:14:29.969" style="s2">me the the theories that might be</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.139" end="02:14:32.040" style="s2">portals into a different way of looking</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.969" end="02:14:33.510" style="s2">at the world one of them that you</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.040" end="02:14:37.469" style="s2">brought into my I&#39;ve never heard it</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.510" end="02:14:40.020" style="s2">before was Gerard&#39;s various theories and</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.469" end="02:14:42.989" style="s2">I wonder if you might say you&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.020" end="02:14:45.329" style="s2">credited your success in business to how</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.989" end="02:14:47.639" style="s2">you understood and you applied your army</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.329" end="02:14:50.070" style="s2">obviously he didn&#39;t have this kind of</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.639" end="02:14:51.630" style="s2">level of business success so can you</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.070" end="02:14:54.000" style="s2">talk a little bit about your personal</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.630" end="02:14:55.440" style="s2">relationship to Renee Gerard&#39;s theories</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.000" end="02:14:58.320" style="s2">as a portal into a different way of</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.440" end="02:15:00.719" style="s2">seeing the world well it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.320" end="02:15:03.510" style="s2">about the theory so it&#39;s a it was sort</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.719" end="02:15:07.579" style="s2">of this um theory of human psychology as</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.510" end="02:15:10.920" style="s2">deeply mimetic where you sort of um you</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.579" end="02:15:14.190" style="s2">copy other people so just for the folks</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.920" end="02:15:17.010" style="s2">at home mimetic as in mime rather than</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.190" end="02:15:17.880" style="s2">me medic is in meme yes can closely</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.010" end="02:15:20.190" style="s2">relate</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.880" end="02:15:21.750" style="s2">you imitate people but you imitate</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.190" end="02:15:23.940" style="s2">that&#39;s how you learn to speak as a child</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.750" end="02:15:26.730" style="s2">you copy your parents language that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.940" end="02:15:29.219" style="s2">how then you also imitate desire and</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.730" end="02:15:30.800" style="s2">then there are sort of all sorts of</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.219" end="02:15:33.050" style="s2">aspects of mimesis</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.800" end="02:15:35.510" style="s2">can lead to sort of mass violence mass</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.050" end="02:15:37.880" style="s2">insanity so it has it&#39;s it&#39;s both what</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.510" end="02:15:41.960" style="s2">enables human culture to function but it</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.880" end="02:15:43.880" style="s2">also it also is is quite quite dangerous</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.960" end="02:15:46.130" style="s2">and you know when I came across the sort</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.880" end="02:15:49.400" style="s2">of constellation of ideas as an</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.130" end="02:15:52.010" style="s2">undergraduate at Stanford my my biases</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.400" end="02:15:54.310" style="s2">were sort of libertarian classic liberal</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.010" end="02:15:56.960" style="s2">you know only individuals exist</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.310" end="02:15:58.850" style="s2">individuals who radically autonomous can</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.960" end="02:16:01.760" style="s2">can think for themselves and so this was</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.850" end="02:16:05.390" style="s2">a it was both you know it was sort of a</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.760" end="02:16:07.610" style="s2">powerful corrective to that</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.390" end="02:16:11.090" style="s2">intellectually but then it also worked</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.610" end="02:16:12.470" style="s2">on an existential level where you sort</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.090" end="02:16:15.080" style="s2">of realized while there all these ways</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.470" end="02:16:17.030" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been hyper mimetic I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.080" end="02:16:19.520" style="s2">hyper tracked why my Stanford what does</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.030" end="02:16:22.660" style="s2">this matter so much why you know why am</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.520" end="02:16:25.700" style="s2">i doing all the things I&#39;m doing and and</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.660" end="02:16:27.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s it&#39;s a prism through which</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.700" end="02:16:30.110" style="s2">one one looks at a lot of things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.950" end="02:16:33.140" style="s2">uh that I found to be you know quite</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.110" end="02:16:34.670" style="s2">helpful over over over recent decades I</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.140" end="02:16:37.070" style="s2">think the preference falsification you</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.670" end="02:16:38.660" style="s2">can think of in mimetic terms where you</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.070" end="02:16:41.390" style="s2">know everybody goes along with what</p>
<p begin="02:16:38.660" end="02:16:43.970" style="s2">everybody else thinks and then you can</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.390" end="02:16:46.220" style="s2">get these sort of chaotic points where</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.970" end="02:16:47.750" style="s2">all of a sudden things can shift much</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.220" end="02:16:49.730" style="s2">faster than you would think possible</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.750" end="02:16:52.070" style="s2">because they&#39;re all these dynamics that</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.730" end="02:16:54.410" style="s2">are not you know not simply rational</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.070" end="02:16:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite correct to to model</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.410" end="02:16:59.660" style="s2">people as these sort of classical atoms</p>
<p begin="02:16:56.720" end="02:17:01.790" style="s2">or something like that it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.660" end="02:17:04.670" style="s2">entangled do you what would be a good</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.790" end="02:17:07.730" style="s2">way for people listening at home to</p>
<p begin="02:17:04.670" end="02:17:09.710" style="s2">start to get into Gerard&#39;s philosophy if</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.730" end="02:17:11.810" style="s2">they were interested well there are you</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.710" end="02:17:13.460" style="s2">know it&#39;s there&#39;s for the number of</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.810" end="02:17:15.770" style="s2">different books that Gerard wrote I</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.460" end="02:17:17.240" style="s2">think the the Magisterial one is</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.770" end="02:17:19.210" style="s2">probably things hidden since the</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.240" end="02:17:22.400" style="s2">foundation of the world so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.210" end="02:17:24.440" style="s2">truth of mimesis and violence and the</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.400" end="02:17:28.310" style="s2">waste so it&#39;s sort of part psychology</p>
<p begin="02:17:24.440" end="02:17:29.990" style="s2">part anthropology part part history you</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.310" end="02:17:32.180" style="s2">know all portal I should point out</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.990" end="02:17:35.030" style="s2">because it&#39;s the draw hit it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.180" end="02:17:38.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a portal onto the past onto human</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.030" end="02:17:41.510" style="s2">origins it&#39;s a it&#39;s a and our history</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.330" end="02:17:44.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a portal onto the present onto the</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.510" end="02:17:48.010" style="s2">interpersonal dynamics of psychology</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.710" end="02:17:50.530" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s um you know it&#39;s a portal</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.010" end="02:17:52.599" style="s2">onto the future in terms of you know you</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.530" end="02:17:55.090" style="s2">know are we going to let these mimetic</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.599" end="02:17:57.639" style="s2">desires run amok and head towards</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.090" end="02:17:59.740" style="s2">apocalyptic violence for you know um</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.639" end="02:18:01.300" style="s2">even the entire planet to come no longer</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.740" end="02:18:04.210" style="s2">absorb the violence that we can unleash</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.300" end="02:18:06.700" style="s2">or are we gonna learn from this and and</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.210" end="02:18:08.110" style="s2">transcend this and in a way where we we</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.700" end="02:18:10.719" style="s2">get to some some very different place</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.110" end="02:18:14.290" style="s2">and so it has it has a sense that you</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.719" end="02:18:16.479" style="s2">know both danger and and hope for the</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.290" end="02:18:19.330" style="s2">future as well so it&#39;s a it is sort of</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.479" end="02:18:22.630" style="s2">this you know panoramic theory on a lot</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.330" end="02:18:25.630" style="s2">of ways super powerful and and just</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.630" end="02:18:27.670" style="s2">extraordinarily different from from what</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.630" end="02:18:28.840" style="s2">when one would normally hear there was</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.670" end="02:18:30.910" style="s2">you know there was there&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.840" end="02:18:32.410" style="s2">almost a cult-like element where you had</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.910" end="02:18:34.809" style="s2">you know these people who are followers</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.410" end="02:18:36.790" style="s2">of Gerard and it was sort of a sense</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.809" end="02:18:38.349" style="s2">that you know we had we had figured out</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.790" end="02:18:41.019" style="s2">the truth about the world in a way that</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.349" end="02:18:43.330" style="s2">nobody else did and that you know that</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.019" end="02:18:44.650" style="s2">that was generative and very powerful so</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.330" end="02:18:49.990" style="s2">you know it was always this parts of it</p>
<p begin="02:18:44.650" end="02:18:51.969" style="s2">that are unhealthy but but it was um you</p>
<p begin="02:18:49.990" end="02:18:54.580" style="s2">know it was it has sort of an incredible</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.969" end="02:18:56.050" style="s2">dynamism and then just you are aware</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.580" end="02:18:58.660" style="s2">that you know maybe things are so</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.050" end="02:19:01.599" style="s2">different from how how they appear to be</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.660" end="02:19:03.070" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s you know there may be</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.599" end="02:19:05.110" style="s2">a portal out there there may be you know</p>
<p begin="02:19:03.070" end="02:19:08.620" style="s2">what was shocking to me I mean the first</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.110" end="02:19:11.440" style="s2">time I heard about it you invited me to</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.620" end="02:19:14.769" style="s2">a conference that you were keeping quiet</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.440" end="02:19:18.370" style="s2">and I was in the news and there was a</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.769" end="02:19:20.620" style="s2">quite a lot of anger and furor that I</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.370" end="02:19:23.769" style="s2">had done something wrong and you waited</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.620" end="02:19:26.229" style="s2">a few days to give a talk and you talked</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.769" end="02:19:29.440" style="s2">about scapegoating and the mechanism by</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.229" end="02:19:31.809" style="s2">which violence that might be visited</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.440" end="02:19:34.210" style="s2">upon the many is visited upon the one</p>
<p begin="02:19:31.809" end="02:19:38.590" style="s2">and then you also started talking about</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.210" end="02:19:40.599" style="s2">the King as if he is sort of scapegoat</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.590" end="02:19:42.099" style="s2">in Waiting so that the king is not</p>
<p begin="02:19:40.599" end="02:19:44.429" style="s2">necessarily something that one would</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.099" end="02:19:46.450" style="s2">want to be and I found it absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.429" end="02:19:49.210" style="s2">fascinating because it turned so many</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.450" end="02:19:50.650" style="s2">ideas on their heads that I got angry at</p>
<p begin="02:19:49.210" end="02:19:52.330" style="s2">you why hadn&#39;t you told me this earlier</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.650" end="02:19:54.190" style="s2">when I&#39;d been through three sleep</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.330" end="02:19:55.630" style="s2">sleepless nights before I&#39;d heard the</p>
<p begin="02:19:54.190" end="02:19:58.300" style="s2">theory so I found it instantly</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.630" end="02:19:58.601" style="s2">applicable particularly if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.300" end="02:20:00.610" style="s2">sort</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.601" end="02:20:03.280" style="s2">a person who&#39;s likely to get scapegoated</p>
<p begin="02:20:00.610" end="02:20:05.230" style="s2">by not taking refuge in the herd do you</p>
<p begin="02:20:03.280" end="02:20:09.251" style="s2">think it has more relevance to people</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.230" end="02:20:11.410" style="s2">who are struggling to like break out as</p>
<p begin="02:20:09.251" end="02:20:15.751" style="s2">individuals because of the possibility</p>
<p begin="02:20:11.410" end="02:20:19.450" style="s2">of being picked off you know I I think</p>
<p begin="02:20:15.751" end="02:20:22.120" style="s2">um well I think it has Universal</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.450" end="02:20:24.641" style="s2">thinking I think it is you know oddly</p>
<p begin="02:20:22.120" end="02:20:26.381" style="s2">true yeah has some sort of Universal</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.641" end="02:20:28.721" style="s2">relevance I think the problems of</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.381" end="02:20:32.471" style="s2">violence and scapegoating are are</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.721" end="02:20:35.041" style="s2">universal problems it is um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.471" end="02:20:38.620" style="s2">probably the case there are certain</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.041" end="02:20:42.521" style="s2">types of people who are more likely to</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.620" end="02:20:44.950" style="s2">become scapegoats but but it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.521" end="02:20:47.291" style="s2">absolute thing yeah and so there is you</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.950" end="02:20:48.671" style="s2">know there&#39;s always um you could say</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.291" end="02:20:50.801" style="s2">there&#39;s an arbitrariness about</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.671" end="02:20:54.851" style="s2">scapegoating because the scapegoat is</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.801" end="02:20:57.551" style="s2">supposed to represent to stand in for</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.851" end="02:20:58.870" style="s2">for everybody and so the scapegoat has</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.551" end="02:21:01.061" style="s2">to be perceived as someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.870" end="02:21:03.521" style="s2">radically other but then also has to</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.061" end="02:21:05.291" style="s2">somehow emerge from from within the</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.521" end="02:21:07.751" style="s2">group and so there are there are times</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.291" end="02:21:10.931" style="s2">when the scapegoat is the sort of</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.751" end="02:21:14.081" style="s2">outlier you know extreme insight or</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.931" end="02:21:15.341" style="s2">extreme outsider you know King slash</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.081" end="02:21:17.561" style="s2">criminal or you know whatever</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.341" end="02:21:19.240" style="s2">personality and that&#39;s that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.561" end="02:21:21.461" style="s2">dangerous sort of thing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:21:19.240" end="02:21:23.831" style="s2">Abraham Lincoln the the incredible</p>
<p begin="02:21:21.461" end="02:21:25.561" style="s2">orator who&#39;s also grows up in a log</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.831" end="02:21:29.521" style="s2">cabin so you know these sort of extreme</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.561" end="02:21:33.700" style="s2">contrasts are often often um you know</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.521" end="02:21:35.980" style="s2">people who who are at risk of this maybe</p>
<p begin="02:21:33.700" end="02:21:38.591" style="s2">more than others and then at the same</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.980" end="02:21:41.021" style="s2">time you know because these are sort of</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.591" end="02:21:43.391" style="s2">mob-like dynamics there is sort of a way</p>
<p begin="02:21:41.021" end="02:21:45.461" style="s2">in which you know it&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.391" end="02:21:48.521" style="s2">really safe from the violence right ever</p>
<p begin="02:21:45.461" end="02:21:53.200" style="s2">no one no one&#39;s completely safe I think</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.521" end="02:21:56.440" style="s2">that&#39;s quite quite true but yes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.200" end="02:21:59.681" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a yes but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:56.440" end="02:22:03.190" style="s2">sort is a thought that one of the sort</p>
<p begin="02:21:59.681" end="02:22:06.431" style="s2">of history ideas that Gerard had that is</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.190" end="02:22:09.251" style="s2">is that is that there&#39;s a dynamic to</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.431" end="02:22:11.230" style="s2">this process where scapegoating it only</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.251" end="02:22:12.310" style="s2">works when people don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.230" end="02:22:14.979" style="s2">and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:12.310" end="02:22:16.600" style="s2">sort of as you understand it better it</p>
<p begin="02:22:14.979" end="02:22:19.569" style="s2">works less well or it has to get</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.600" end="02:22:23.439" style="s2">displaced into other other dimensions</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.569" end="02:22:25.029" style="s2">and so on you know if you have a you</p>
<p begin="02:22:23.439" end="02:22:26.739" style="s2">know if you have a witch-hunt say you</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.029" end="02:22:29.470" style="s2">know we need to find a witch to bring</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.739" end="02:22:31.810" style="s2">back peace to the community that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="02:22:29.470" end="02:22:33.069" style="s2">of a psychosocial understanding of what</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.810" end="02:22:35.229" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is actually</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.069" end="02:22:36.699" style="s2">counterproductive the witch hunt itself</p>
<p begin="02:22:35.229" end="02:22:38.500" style="s2">you know the witch hunt is supposed to</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.699" end="02:22:40.029" style="s2">be supposed to be a theological epiphany</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.500" end="02:22:42.010" style="s2">right you know that God&#39;s telling you</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.029" end="02:22:44.170" style="s2">who the witches if you think of it as</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.010" end="02:22:46.119" style="s2">some sort of psychosocial control</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.170" end="02:22:49.270" style="s2">mechanism then they won&#39;t work anymore</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.119" end="02:22:53.199" style="s2">and so so that you know the metaphor</p>
<p begin="02:22:49.270" end="02:22:57.699" style="s2">that Gerard uses is that you know um the</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.199" end="02:23:00.310" style="s2">sacred is like phlogiston and violence</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.699" end="02:23:02.350" style="s2">is like oxygen and so you know but but</p>
<p begin="02:23:00.310" end="02:23:04.540" style="s2">it only works in a world where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.350" end="02:23:07.540" style="s2">misunderstood and so if you understand</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.540" end="02:23:10.029" style="s2">scapegoating you end up in a world where</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.540" end="02:23:11.579" style="s2">it works less and less well and the kind</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.029" end="02:23:15.189" style="s2">of political and cultural institutions</p>
<p begin="02:23:11.579" end="02:23:17.529" style="s2">that are that are linked to it will will</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.189" end="02:23:22.600" style="s2">tend to unravel you know I think one of</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.529" end="02:23:25.090" style="s2">the one of the sort of on ways in which</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.600" end="02:23:28.659" style="s2">this this has happened a great deal and</p>
<p begin="02:23:25.090" end="02:23:30.670" style="s2">you know in modernity is that we we</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.659" end="02:23:33.609" style="s2">scapegoat the scapegoat or sort of go up</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.670" end="02:23:35.319" style="s2">one level that&#39;s actually and and that</p>
<p begin="02:23:33.609" end="02:23:37.720" style="s2">sort of always it makes it a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:23:35.319" end="02:23:40.000" style="s2">more complicated and so if we go after</p>
<p begin="02:23:37.720" end="02:23:42.460" style="s2">the people who were the historical</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.000" end="02:23:45.399" style="s2">oppressors the historical victimizers</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.460" end="02:23:48.640" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s often you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.399" end="02:23:50.619" style="s2">often a super powerful way and since</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.640" end="02:23:52.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like slightly too complicated there</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.619" end="02:23:54.369" style="s2">was a there&#39;s a Bill Clinton formulation</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.630" end="02:23:56.739" style="s2">of this you know we must unite against</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.369" end="02:23:58.869" style="s2">those who seek to divide us and which is</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.739" end="02:24:01.329" style="s2">on some level itself contradictory yeah</p>
<p begin="02:23:58.869" end="02:24:03.489" style="s2">but then it&#39;s just a little bit too hard</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.329" end="02:24:05.350" style="s2">for people to fully disentangle and</p>
<p begin="02:24:03.489" end="02:24:09.310" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of one way</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.350" end="02:24:11.979" style="s2">that that I think it&#39;s still still um</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.310" end="02:24:13.779" style="s2">sort of works even though um you know</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.979" end="02:24:15.579" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s again when everyone sees these</p>
<p begin="02:24:13.779" end="02:24:17.260" style="s2">moves when everyone understands them it</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.579" end="02:24:18.850" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t work that well anymore so</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.260" end="02:24:22.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it&#39;s like saying</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.850" end="02:24:24.840" style="s2">well like would you like me to prescribe</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.300" end="02:24:24.840" style="s2">you a placebo</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.859" end="02:24:28.620" style="s2">in other words that probably does not</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.210" end="02:24:30.859" style="s2">work very well it doesn&#39;t work very well</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.620" end="02:24:32.760" style="s2">it probably does not work very well and</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.859" end="02:24:34.380" style="s2">but then the other part of it that I</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.760" end="02:24:36.899" style="s2">find terrifying which is but also</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.380" end="02:24:38.790" style="s2">interesting is that implicit in this</p>
<p begin="02:24:36.899" end="02:24:40.979" style="s2">framework is that there is a minimal</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.790" end="02:24:43.500" style="s2">level of violence needed to accomplish</p>
<p begin="02:24:40.979" end="02:24:47.580" style="s2">an end and that the scapegoating</p>
<p begin="02:24:43.500" end="02:24:50.880" style="s2">mechanism well entirely unjust has the</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.580" end="02:24:53.670" style="s2">virtue of being minimal and yes that the</p>
<p begin="02:24:50.880" end="02:24:57.149" style="s2">horror is visited upon the individual</p>
<p begin="02:24:53.670" end="02:24:58.200" style="s2">yes yes or the theological terminology</p>
<p begin="02:24:57.149" end="02:25:01.109" style="s2">Gerard would use would be the</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.200" end="02:25:04.410" style="s2">scapegoating is satanic and that archaic</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.109" end="02:25:05.910" style="s2">cultures were a little bit satanic but</p>
<p begin="02:25:04.410" end="02:25:08.220" style="s2">not very and they were sort of satanic</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.910" end="02:25:10.800" style="s2">in an innocent way because the violence</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.220" end="02:25:18.090" style="s2">was actually you know a way to limit</p>
<p begin="02:25:10.800" end="02:25:20.850" style="s2">violence that that you know we violated</p>
<p begin="02:25:18.090" end="02:25:24.080" style="s2">by Allah knew I&#39;ve out violence and this</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.850" end="02:25:28.800" style="s2">is this is how this is how our societies</p>
<p begin="02:25:24.080" end="02:25:30.540" style="s2">how our societies work and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.800" end="02:25:32.189" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not quite clear how things</p>
<p begin="02:25:30.540" end="02:25:35.240" style="s2">will will continue to work so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:32.189" end="02:25:37.859" style="s2">yeah so you could always say that</p>
<p begin="02:25:35.240" end="02:25:40.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which and this is</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.859" end="02:25:42.510" style="s2">super broad brushstroke type argument</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.410" end="02:25:46.979" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which you can say that</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.510" end="02:25:49.290" style="s2">um the left is more focused on unjust on</p>
<p begin="02:25:46.979" end="02:25:52.319" style="s2">the unjustified nature of violence and</p>
<p begin="02:25:49.290" end="02:25:54.420" style="s2">the right is more focused on how a</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.319" end="02:25:57.840" style="s2">certain amount of violence is needed for</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.420" end="02:26:01.050" style="s2">society and and there and there are ways</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.840" end="02:26:03.750" style="s2">in which um they&#39;re both right and then</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.050" end="02:26:07.439" style="s2">there ways in which they&#39;re they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="02:26:03.750" end="02:26:08.399" style="s2">deconstructing each other I suppose you</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.439" end="02:26:13.470" style="s2">could say the nation-state</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.399" end="02:26:15.780" style="s2">a nation-state contains violence in both</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.470" end="02:26:19.140" style="s2">senses of the word contain because</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.780" end="02:26:21.060" style="s2">that&#39;s good it contains it as it limits</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.140" end="02:26:23.520" style="s2">it a channels it in certain ways well</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.060" end="02:26:26.370" style="s2">then it&#39;s also part of part of its very</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.520" end="02:26:28.950" style="s2">being and and you got into yeah all</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.370" end="02:26:31.229" style="s2">these questions when you know when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:28.950" end="02:26:33.720" style="s2">appropriate when it&#39;s when it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="02:26:31.229" end="02:26:35.160" style="s2">that&#39;s why you know I I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.720" end="02:26:38.069" style="s2">violence I think you know it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.160" end="02:26:39.540" style="s2">serious problem but to also recognize</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.069" end="02:26:41.521" style="s2">hands instrumental major</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.540" end="02:26:44.970" style="s2">she said we&#39;re gonna get rid of all</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.521" end="02:26:47.220" style="s2">violence tomorrow it&#39;s gonna stop you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.970" end="02:26:49.320" style="s2">be talking about nothing or I think I</p>
<p begin="02:26:47.220" end="02:26:51.360" style="s2">think so he&#39;s no way in which that can</p>
<p begin="02:26:49.320" end="02:26:54.660" style="s2">well that that might require tremendous</p>
<p begin="02:26:51.360" end="02:26:56.450" style="s2">amount of violence to enact or on or if</p>
<p begin="02:26:54.660" end="02:26:58.350" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have no more violence at all</p>
<p begin="02:26:56.450" end="02:27:02.010" style="s2">you&#39;ll you know maybe you&#39;ll have just</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.350" end="02:27:04.260" style="s2">total chaos and a lot of violence well</p>
<p begin="02:27:02.010" end="02:27:06.420" style="s2">in that form so it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.260" end="02:27:07.320" style="s2">an interesting problem to ant yeah</p>
<p begin="02:27:06.420" end="02:27:09.720" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of all these interesting</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.320" end="02:27:11.640" style="s2">descriptors but then how to practically</p>

<p begin="02:27:17.460" end="02:27:22.460" style="s2">or not is that I think we on the left</p>
<p begin="02:27:19.740" end="02:27:27.180" style="s2">are somewhat divided between two camps</p>
<p begin="02:27:22.460" end="02:27:29.640" style="s2">one camp is quite open about wanting to</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.180" end="02:27:32.730" style="s2">end depression and the other camp is</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.640" end="02:27:34.170" style="s2">cryptic about wanting to reverse it in</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.730" end="02:27:36.660" style="s2">other words you&#39;ve oppressed for long</p>
<p begin="02:27:34.170" end="02:27:39.360" style="s2">enough it is your turn to be oppressed</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.660" end="02:27:42.330" style="s2">by us and we are actually envious of</p>
<p begin="02:27:39.360" end="02:27:43.920" style="s2">oppression and there is something of a</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.330" end="02:27:46.050" style="s2">civil war I mean I would say this is the</p>

<p begin="02:27:46.050" end="02:27:50.730" style="s2">left flank is misunderstood which is</p>
<p begin="02:27:48.480" end="02:27:55.220" style="s2">that almost none of the left wing</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.730" end="02:27:58.980" style="s2">members of the IDW are interested in</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.220" end="02:28:01.260" style="s2">oppressing anybody so there&#39;s no give me</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.980" end="02:28:04.500" style="s2">no payback period that that sounds like</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.260" end="02:28:06.720" style="s2">fun to us and one of the things I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:28:04.500" end="02:28:10.170" style="s2">understood until it was said to me quite</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.720" end="02:28:12.660" style="s2">starkly if progress is messy you got to</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.170" end="02:28:17.240" style="s2">break a few eggs to make an omelet there</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.660" end="02:28:20.160" style="s2">is this just tolerance bordering on</p>
<p begin="02:28:17.240" end="02:28:22.140" style="s2">excitement about the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.160" end="02:28:23.790" style="s2">stick it to those who have stuck it to</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.140" end="02:28:25.650" style="s2">you from your perspective that this is</p>
<p begin="02:28:23.790" end="02:28:28.830" style="s2">an aspect of justice whereas the</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.650" end="02:28:30.600" style="s2">cessation of oppression is interesting</p>
<p begin="02:28:28.830" end="02:28:33.840" style="s2">to another part of that group yes much</p>
<p begin="02:28:30.600" end="02:28:36.120" style="s2">less yellow the disturbing thing is that</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.840" end="02:28:38.850" style="s2">it&#39;s of course much less exciting and</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.120" end="02:28:40.620" style="s2">much less energizing so I often think if</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.850" end="02:28:43.680" style="s2">you if you listen to political speech</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.620" end="02:28:45.480" style="s2">right the applause lines are always the</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.680" end="02:28:47.820" style="s2">ones we are going to go after the other</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.480" end="02:28:50.310" style="s2">side yeah we&#39;re we&#39;re gonna go after the</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.820" end="02:28:52.380" style="s2">bad people we&#39;re gonna stop them and if</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.310" end="02:28:53.160" style="s2">you try to construct a political speech</p>
<p begin="02:28:52.380" end="02:28:56.670" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.160" end="02:28:58.710" style="s2">um it was we&#39;re gonna unite people we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.670" end="02:29:02.641" style="s2">gonna get everybody onto the skull and</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.710" end="02:29:04.680" style="s2">there were no bad people um it would be</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.641" end="02:29:05.970" style="s2">it&#39;s almost impossible to have a speech</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.680" end="02:29:07.950" style="s2">that has any energy at all</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.970" end="02:29:10.740" style="s2">well I and and and so I you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.950" end="02:29:14.340" style="s2">it&#39;s uh let me take issue with that</p>
<p begin="02:29:10.740" end="02:29:16.980" style="s2">slightly my excitement was it a</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.340" end="02:29:19.710" style="s2">political speech exactly what you said</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.980" end="02:29:22.290" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think I miss can I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.710" end="02:29:25.891" style="s2">mischaracterize it I think that the</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.290" end="02:29:28.170" style="s2">problem is the reason I pour energy into</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.891" end="02:29:30.980" style="s2">trying to stop the political correctness</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.170" end="02:29:32.970" style="s2">and and the rules about what can be said</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.980" end="02:29:34.320" style="s2">mostly has to do with the fact that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.970" end="02:29:36.590" style="s2">incredibly excited</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.320" end="02:29:39.450" style="s2">except I&#39;m excited about something</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.590" end="02:29:42.680" style="s2">non-political like if what I&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="02:29:39.450" end="02:29:47.220" style="s2">about is pursuing technological progress</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.680" end="02:29:50.010" style="s2">scientific progress more people being</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.220" end="02:29:52.021" style="s2">able to form families etc that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="02:29:50.010" end="02:29:53.880" style="s2">the excitement is it&#39;s not coming from</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.021" end="02:29:56.280" style="s2">the politics it&#39;s coming from what the</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.880" end="02:29:58.141" style="s2">politics facilitates and so I think that</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.280" end="02:30:00.960" style="s2">the problem with these speeches is if</p>
<p begin="02:29:58.141" end="02:30:03.891" style="s2">you don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.960" end="02:30:06.870" style="s2">that we&#39;re keeping the space clean for</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.891" end="02:30:08.190" style="s2">mm-hmm we might as well riot or</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.870" end="02:30:09.510" style="s2">something because at least that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.190" end="02:30:11.790" style="s2">exciting and that&#39;s got some energy</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.510" end="02:30:13.650" style="s2">behind it and then it&#39;s my team versus</p>
<p begin="02:30:11.790" end="02:30:16.771" style="s2">your team but I think that would both</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.650" end="02:30:18.930" style="s2">you and I have been focus um level</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.771" end="02:30:21.480" style="s2">anybody is focused on technology as you</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.930" end="02:30:23.700" style="s2">are is a progressive in the sense of</p>
<p begin="02:30:21.480" end="02:30:26.760" style="s2">caring about what is actually progress</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.700" end="02:30:28.561" style="s2">and I think that that the danger comes</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.760" end="02:30:31.141" style="s2">from when politics becomes your</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.561" end="02:30:33.540" style="s2">entertainment and you know you read very</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.141" end="02:30:35.070" style="s2">correctly I learned this from you that</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.540" end="02:30:37.771" style="s2">when you look at a bunch of candidates</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.070" end="02:30:41.160" style="s2">debating on a crowd at a stage look at</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.771" end="02:30:43.830" style="s2">where the energy is and the energy is</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.160" end="02:30:46.260" style="s2">something that is not in my opinion a</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.830" end="02:30:48.900" style="s2">good indicator it&#39;s not a good proximate</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.260" end="02:30:52.950" style="s2">for the ultimate that I care about yes</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.900" end="02:30:54.900" style="s2">look I I&#39;d like it to be just the way</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.950" end="02:30:55.740" style="s2">you described I I just one of the right</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.900" end="02:30:58.230" style="s2">Joey</p>
<p begin="02:30:55.740" end="02:31:00.601" style="s2">it often is not and and so yes</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.230" end="02:31:03.720" style="s2">scientific technological progress right</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.601" end="02:31:06.189" style="s2">in a way can hope as it can lead towards</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.720" end="02:31:09.329" style="s2">a more cornucopia in which</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.189" end="02:31:13.209" style="s2">there&#39;s um less Malthusian struggle less</p>
<p begin="02:31:09.329" end="02:31:14.920" style="s2">less violence um and then at the same at</p>
<p begin="02:31:13.209" end="02:31:17.020" style="s2">the very same time you know an honest</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.920" end="02:31:19.449" style="s2">account of the history these things is</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.020" end="02:31:21.760" style="s2">that you know a lot of it was used to</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.449" end="02:31:25.329" style="s2">develop or advanced weapons it was in</p>
<p begin="02:31:21.760" end="02:31:27.819" style="s2">the pursuit of violence and one sort of</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.329" end="02:31:31.300" style="s2">account of the tech stagnation the</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.819" end="02:31:33.459" style="s2">scientific tech stagnation is that you</p>
<p begin="02:31:31.300" end="02:31:35.949" style="s2">know the the breakthrough thing was the</p>
<p begin="02:31:33.459" end="02:31:37.840" style="s2">atom bomb and then you know we and then</p>
<p begin="02:31:35.949" end="02:31:41.800" style="s2">you built the rockets to deliver the</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.840" end="02:31:43.810" style="s2">bombs more quickly and by 1970 we had</p>
<p begin="02:31:41.800" end="02:31:45.430" style="s2">enough bombs and rockets destroy the</p>
<p begin="02:31:43.810" end="02:31:48.310" style="s2">world ten or twenty times over or</p>
<p begin="02:31:45.430" end="02:31:51.459" style="s2">whatever and the whole thing made no</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.310" end="02:31:53.709" style="s2">more sense and and so if one of the big</p>
<p begin="02:31:51.459" end="02:31:59.350" style="s2">drivers of scientific and technological</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.709" end="02:32:02.880" style="s2">progress was um was actually just this</p>
<p begin="02:31:59.350" end="02:32:06.520" style="s2">sort of military dimension when that</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.880" end="02:32:09.220" style="s2">became absurd you know did the whole</p>
<p begin="02:32:06.520" end="02:32:12.130" style="s2">thing slow down to the Space Age and you</p>
<p begin="02:32:09.220" end="02:32:13.439" style="s2">know not in 1972 when Apollo left the</p>
<p begin="02:32:12.130" end="02:32:15.670" style="s2">moon but it was it was the key moment</p>
<p begin="02:32:13.439" end="02:32:17.739" style="s2">1975 when you had the Apollo Soyuz</p>
<p begin="02:32:15.670" end="02:32:19.959" style="s2">docking and like if we&#39;re just gonna be</p>
<p begin="02:32:17.739" end="02:32:21.399" style="s2">friends with the Russians are we does it</p>
<p begin="02:32:19.959" end="02:32:23.079" style="s2">really make sense for people working 80</p>
<p begin="02:32:21.399" end="02:32:25.930" style="s2">hours a hundred hours a week around the</p>
<p begin="02:32:23.079" end="02:32:28.840" style="s2">clock and again I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="02:32:25.930" end="02:32:30.220" style="s2">that but but I think one of the one of</p>
<p begin="02:32:28.840" end="02:32:32.499" style="s2">the challenges that and we should not</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.220" end="02:32:34.539" style="s2">understate how big it is in resetting</p>
<p begin="02:32:32.499" end="02:32:37.090" style="s2">Science and Technology in the 21st</p>
<p begin="02:32:34.539" end="02:32:38.800" style="s2">century is you know how do we tell a</p>
<p begin="02:32:37.090" end="02:32:41.020" style="s2">story that motivates sacrifice</p>
<p begin="02:32:38.800" end="02:32:42.729" style="s2">incredibly hard work deferred</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.020" end="02:32:45.729" style="s2">gratification for the future</p>
<p begin="02:32:42.729" end="02:32:53.949" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s not intrinsically</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.729" end="02:32:56.109" style="s2">violent yeah and and and it was it was</p>
<p begin="02:32:53.949" end="02:33:00.399" style="s2">combined with that in in all these</p>
<p begin="02:32:56.109" end="02:33:02.619" style="s2">powerful ways well you know you so when</p>
<p begin="02:33:00.399" end="02:33:05.319" style="s2">I think about the way in which the</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.619" end="02:33:06.310" style="s2">nation let&#39;s say came around is it</p>
<p begin="02:33:05.319" end="02:33:07.869" style="s2">because I think this is this is like</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.310" end="02:33:11.020" style="s2">this is one of the reasons you know if</p>
<p begin="02:33:07.869" end="02:33:12.550" style="s2">you sort of take people you know the a</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.020" end="02:33:14.949" style="s2">lot of people deny that there&#39;s a tech</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.550" end="02:33:17.260" style="s2">science stagnation going on sure but</p>
<p begin="02:33:14.949" end="02:33:19.149" style="s2">then you know one of the other things</p>
<p begin="02:33:17.260" end="02:33:19.960" style="s2">one hears as well you know maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:33:19.149" end="02:33:21.340" style="s2">not progressing as</p>
<p begin="02:33:19.960" end="02:33:23.830" style="s2">but do we really want it to progress</p>
<p begin="02:33:21.340" end="02:33:26.110" style="s2">this fast and isn&#39;t it dangerous and</p>
<p begin="02:33:23.830" end="02:33:28.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t it you know we&#39;re just gonna build</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.110" end="02:33:30.550" style="s2">the AI that&#39;s gonna kill everybody or</p>
<p begin="02:33:28.330" end="02:33:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;ll be you know biological weapons or</p>
<p begin="02:33:30.550" end="02:33:36.550" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be you know runaway</p>
<p begin="02:33:32.400" end="02:33:38.140" style="s2">nanotechnology or you know and and and</p>
<p begin="02:33:36.550" end="02:33:40.890" style="s2">III don&#39;t think we should you know</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.140" end="02:33:43.090" style="s2">dismiss those fears you know completely</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.890" end="02:33:44.320" style="s2">they&#39;re not completely oh the fear is</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.090" end="02:33:48.070" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to make these things</p>
<p begin="02:33:44.320" end="02:33:50.560" style="s2">cheap and easy whereas right now you you</p>
<p begin="02:33:48.070" end="02:33:52.390" style="s2">still need a state to do a lot of this</p>
<p begin="02:33:50.560" end="02:33:54.040" style="s2">work I mean you know you let the Elan</p>
<p begin="02:33:52.390" end="02:33:56.080" style="s2">musk is one of the first private</p>
<p begin="02:33:54.040" end="02:33:57.880" style="s2">individuals with a space program you</p>
<p begin="02:33:56.080" end="02:34:01.380" style="s2">know that&#39;s a version of it but I think</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.880" end="02:34:04.330" style="s2">in general it&#39;s just that that somehow</p>
<p begin="02:34:01.380" end="02:34:05.710" style="s2">you will lose control over over the</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.330" end="02:34:08.110" style="s2">violence you think you can control it</p>
<p begin="02:34:05.710" end="02:34:09.880" style="s2">maybe maybe it&#39;s a large state maybe</p>
<p begin="02:34:08.110" end="02:34:11.740" style="s2">it&#39;s you know maybe it&#39;s autonomous AI</p>
<p begin="02:34:09.880" end="02:34:14.080" style="s2">weapons which in theory are controlled</p>
<p begin="02:34:11.740" end="02:34:16.000" style="s2">by state but in practice not quite so</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.080" end="02:34:17.410" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah there&#39;s sort of all these all</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.000" end="02:34:19.660" style="s2">these scenarios where the stuff can</p>
<p begin="02:34:17.410" end="02:34:21.880" style="s2">conspire a lot of control you know I I</p>
<p begin="02:34:19.660" end="02:34:23.890" style="s2">I&#39;m more scared of the one where nothing</p>
<p begin="02:34:21.880" end="02:34:25.690" style="s2">happens right so I&#39;m I&#39;m more scared of</p>
<p begin="02:34:23.890" end="02:34:27.729" style="s2">like the stagnation world I feel</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.690" end="02:34:29.470" style="s2">ultimately goes this is straight to</p>
<p begin="02:34:27.729" end="02:34:32.380" style="s2">apocalypse this is the way my much more</p>
<p begin="02:34:29.470" end="02:34:34.600" style="s2">scared of that but we have to understand</p>
<p begin="02:34:32.380" end="02:34:36.970" style="s2">why people are scared of the non</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.600" end="02:34:38.110" style="s2">stagnant world well it&#39;s a very straight</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.970" end="02:34:39.640" style="s2">I mean point they&#39;re a couple of threads</p>
<p begin="02:34:38.110" end="02:34:42.820" style="s2">here that are super important one of</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.640" end="02:34:45.100" style="s2">which is that one thing that I sense</p>
<p begin="02:34:42.820" end="02:34:48.720" style="s2">that both of us get frustrated with is</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.100" end="02:34:52.750" style="s2">that if you think about growth as</p>
<p begin="02:34:48.720" end="02:34:55.120" style="s2">necessary to contain certain violence</p>
<p begin="02:34:52.750" end="02:34:59.110" style="s2">and you think about growth is largely</p>
<p begin="02:34:55.120" end="02:35:04.810" style="s2">also being how much fossil fuels you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:34:59.110" end="02:35:07.960" style="s2">able to burn climate is not paired with</p>
<p begin="02:35:04.810" end="02:35:15.280" style="s2">kind of a reduction in opulence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.960" end="02:35:20.130" style="s2">paired on the other side with with war</p>
<p begin="02:35:15.280" end="02:35:23.140" style="s2">and if you over focus on climate and you</p>
<p begin="02:35:20.130" end="02:35:24.700" style="s2">result in a situation in which growth is</p>
<p begin="02:35:23.140" end="02:35:26.950" style="s2">slowed to a halt now growth doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.700" end="02:35:28.750" style="s2">to be the amount of fossil fuel you burn</p>
<p begin="02:35:26.950" end="02:35:31.750" style="s2">but it has largely been that up until</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.750" end="02:35:33.580" style="s2">the present you actually see that the</p>
<p begin="02:35:31.750" end="02:35:35.290" style="s2">trade-off that your face</p>
<p begin="02:35:33.580" end="02:35:38.230" style="s2">is very different than the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:35:35.290" end="02:35:39.670" style="s2">usually portrayed by either side and</p>
<p begin="02:35:38.230" end="02:35:41.680" style="s2">somehow we never get around to that</p>
<p begin="02:35:39.670" end="02:35:43.720" style="s2">conversation which would be if we were</p>
<p begin="02:35:41.680" end="02:35:46.840" style="s2">very serious about climate would we be</p>
<p begin="02:35:43.720" end="02:35:48.910" style="s2">plunged into war yeah obviously you</p>
<p begin="02:35:46.840" end="02:35:50.980" style="s2">can&#39;t have an economy without an</p>
<p begin="02:35:48.910" end="02:35:52.390" style="s2">environment but it may also be the case</p>
<p begin="02:35:50.980" end="02:35:55.900" style="s2">that you can&#39;t have into our environment</p>
<p begin="02:35:52.390" end="02:35:57.490" style="s2">without an economy right and and and</p>
<p begin="02:35:55.900" end="02:36:00.970" style="s2">then if both of those statements are</p>
<p begin="02:35:57.490" end="02:36:03.340" style="s2">true maybe maybe you know the set of</p>
<p begin="02:36:00.970" end="02:36:04.600" style="s2">solutions the set of best solutions</p>
<p begin="02:36:03.340" end="02:36:07.300" style="s2">looks really different than if you just</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.600" end="02:36:09.730" style="s2">focus on one and not the other so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:36:07.300" end="02:36:11.680" style="s2">it is why it&#39;s so important for me to</p>
<p begin="02:36:09.730" end="02:36:13.271" style="s2">have environments in which people who</p>
<p begin="02:36:11.680" end="02:36:16.570" style="s2">don&#39;t agree on things would agree on</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.271" end="02:36:18.580" style="s2">what constitutes a conversation can sit</p>
<p begin="02:36:16.570" end="02:36:22.300" style="s2">down with an idea that nobody&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.580" end="02:36:24.010" style="s2">leave the table so but the reputation in</p>
<p begin="02:36:22.300" end="02:36:26.350" style="s2">tatters to the extent that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:36:24.010" end="02:36:27.910" style="s2">find a job on Monday to support</p>
<p begin="02:36:26.350" end="02:36:29.500" style="s2">themselves is that you have to actually</p>
<p begin="02:36:27.910" end="02:36:31.900" style="s2">weigh both of these things</p>
<p begin="02:36:29.500" end="02:36:33.940" style="s2">simultaneously and the great danger is</p>
<p begin="02:36:31.900" end="02:36:40.660" style="s2">people trying to solve either problem in</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.940" end="02:36:42.700" style="s2">isolation well you know um you know if</p>
<p begin="02:36:40.660" end="02:36:43.890" style="s2">one goes with a general climate change</p>
<p begin="02:36:42.700" end="02:36:46.900" style="s2">narrative that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:36:43.890" end="02:36:49.271" style="s2">anthropogenic it&#39;s um it&#39;s the co2</p>
<p begin="02:36:46.900" end="02:36:51.940" style="s2">levels are rising in in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:36:49.271" end="02:36:54.850" style="s2">dangerous and has you know serious risk</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.940" end="02:36:58.061" style="s2">of some kind of big big runaway process</p>
<p begin="02:36:54.850" end="02:37:01.240" style="s2">um you know I think always the the</p>
<p begin="02:36:58.061" end="02:37:02.710" style="s2">political question my mind is on you</p>
<p begin="02:37:01.240" end="02:37:04.540" style="s2">know what do you do about China and what</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.710" end="02:37:07.150" style="s2">do you do about India because these are</p>
<p begin="02:37:04.540" end="02:37:09.340" style="s2">the countries that are you know trying</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.150" end="02:37:11.290" style="s2">to catch up to the developed world they</p>
<p begin="02:37:09.340" end="02:37:14.950" style="s2">have an enormous way to go to catch up</p>
<p begin="02:37:11.290" end="02:37:16.570" style="s2">and and you know it&#39;s a helical</p>
<p begin="02:37:14.950" end="02:37:18.040" style="s2">consequence I think Western Europe</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.570" end="02:37:20.110" style="s2">you&#39;re I think Europe has something like</p>
<p begin="02:37:18.040" end="02:37:23.830" style="s2">8% of the carbon emissions in the world</p>
<p begin="02:37:20.110" end="02:37:25.330" style="s2">and and then and then we have to have</p>
<p begin="02:37:23.830" end="02:37:27.220" style="s2">more than just the sort of magical</p>
<p begin="02:37:25.330" end="02:37:29.320" style="s2">political thinking where it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="02:37:27.220" end="02:37:32.290" style="s2">like you know we&#39;re gonna have a carbon</p>
<p begin="02:37:29.320" end="02:37:34.540" style="s2">tax in California and this will be so</p>
<p begin="02:37:32.290" end="02:37:37.510" style="s2">charismatic and so inspiring that people</p>
<p begin="02:37:34.540" end="02:37:39.700" style="s2">in China and India will copy us and</p>
<p begin="02:37:37.510" end="02:37:41.500" style="s2">follow suit and people aren&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:37:39.700" end="02:37:43.840" style="s2">not willing to actually say that</p>
<p begin="02:37:41.500" end="02:37:46.600" style="s2">literally because it sounds so crazy um</p>
<p begin="02:37:43.840" end="02:37:47.499" style="s2">but if you say that that&#39;s not the way</p>
<p begin="02:37:46.600" end="02:37:50.589" style="s2">things actually</p>
<p begin="02:37:47.499" end="02:37:51.579" style="s2">work then then somehow you need you know</p>
<p begin="02:37:50.589" end="02:37:53.529" style="s2">you need to do some really different</p>
<p begin="02:37:51.579" end="02:37:55.659" style="s2">things we need to find energy sources</p>
<p begin="02:37:53.529" end="02:37:57.569" style="s2">that are not carbon dioxide intensive</p>
<p begin="02:37:55.659" end="02:38:02.199" style="s2">maybe we need to figure out ways to</p>
<p begin="02:37:57.569" end="02:38:03.819" style="s2">engineer carbon sinks you know the is</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.199" end="02:38:05.859" style="s2">all the sort of crazy geoengineering</p>
<p begin="02:38:03.819" end="02:38:08.709" style="s2">stuff that maybe should be on the table</p>
<p begin="02:38:05.859" end="02:38:10.659" style="s2">maybe we should be more open to to</p>
<p begin="02:38:08.709" end="02:38:12.189" style="s2">nuclear power either sort of like a</p>
<p begin="02:38:10.659" end="02:38:15.009" style="s2">range of very different debates it</p>
<p begin="02:38:12.189" end="02:38:16.659" style="s2">pushes you towards let me take a</p>
<p begin="02:38:15.009" end="02:38:18.999" style="s2">slightly different tack the two</p>
<p begin="02:38:16.659" end="02:38:20.799" style="s2">statements that I found later in life</p>
<p begin="02:38:18.999" end="02:38:21.789" style="s2">unfortunately but have both been</p>
<p begin="02:38:20.799" end="02:38:24.009" style="s2">meaningful to me</p>
<p begin="02:38:21.789" end="02:38:26.079" style="s2">one is vapors definition that a</p>
<p begin="02:38:24.009" end="02:38:29.049" style="s2">government is a monopoly on violence and</p>
<p begin="02:38:26.079" end="02:38:33.219" style="s2">and the other one it&#39;s a guy I can never</p>
<p begin="02:38:29.049" end="02:38:36.489" style="s2">remember who said I think as a French</p>
<p begin="02:38:33.219" end="02:38:37.989" style="s2">political philosopher said a nation is a</p>
<p begin="02:38:36.489" end="02:38:41.139" style="s2">group of people who have agreed to</p>
<p begin="02:38:37.989" end="02:38:43.509" style="s2">forget something in common and if you</p>
<p begin="02:38:41.139" end="02:38:46.059" style="s2">put these things together if you imagine</p>
<p begin="02:38:43.509" end="02:38:48.939" style="s2">that somehow we&#39;ve now gone in for the</p>
<p begin="02:38:46.059" end="02:38:50.529" style="s2">belief the transparency is almost always</p>
<p begin="02:38:48.939" end="02:38:52.599" style="s2">a good thing and then what we need is</p>
<p begin="02:38:50.529" end="02:38:55.509" style="s2">greater transparency to control the</p>
<p begin="02:38:52.599" end="02:38:57.519" style="s2">badness in our society we probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:38:55.509" end="02:38:59.169" style="s2">be able to forget anything in common</p>
<p begin="02:38:57.519" end="02:39:01.539" style="s2">therefore we may not be able to have a</p>
<p begin="02:38:59.169" end="02:39:04.959" style="s2">nation and therefore the nation may not</p>
<p begin="02:39:01.539" end="02:39:07.719" style="s2">be able to monopolize violence which is</p>
<p begin="02:39:04.959" end="02:39:10.119" style="s2">a very disturbing but interesting causal</p>
<p begin="02:39:07.719" end="02:39:12.489" style="s2">chain can we explore the idea of</p>
<p begin="02:39:10.119" end="02:39:15.909" style="s2">transparency given that people seem to</p>
<p begin="02:39:12.489" end="02:39:17.979" style="s2">now associate certain words with</p>
<p begin="02:39:15.909" end="02:39:20.109" style="s2">positivity even though normally we would</p>
<p begin="02:39:17.979" end="02:39:23.019" style="s2">have thought about privacy transparency</p>
<p begin="02:39:20.109" end="02:39:24.609" style="s2">trade-offs let&#39;s say yes why I always do</p>
<p begin="02:39:23.019" end="02:39:29.019" style="s2">think there&#39;s a privacy transparency</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.609" end="02:39:31.359" style="s2">trade-off and and and there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:29.019" end="02:39:32.799" style="s2">always you know it&#39;s always a one thing</p>
<p begin="02:39:31.359" end="02:39:35.019" style="s2">is always confusing about transparency</p>
<p begin="02:39:32.799" end="02:39:38.949" style="s2">it means there&#39;s transparency in theory</p>
<p begin="02:39:35.019" end="02:39:41.769" style="s2">which is like this panopticon like thing</p>
<p begin="02:39:38.949" end="02:39:44.259" style="s2">where the entire planet gets illuminated</p>
<p begin="02:39:41.769" end="02:39:47.739" style="s2">brightly and equally everywhere all at</p>
<p begin="02:39:44.259" end="02:39:51.219" style="s2">once and and so that&#39;s in theory but</p>
<p begin="02:39:47.739" end="02:39:54.159" style="s2">then in practice it is often it sounds</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.219" end="02:39:56.499" style="s2">more like a weapon that will be directed</p>
<p begin="02:39:54.159" end="02:39:59.409" style="s2">against certain people we&#39;re on you know</p>
<p begin="02:39:56.499" end="02:40:00.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of who gets to render</p>
<p begin="02:39:59.409" end="02:40:02.381" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="02:40:00.400" end="02:40:03.910" style="s2">it&#39;s transparent and who gets and maybe</p>
<p begin="02:40:02.381" end="02:40:05.290" style="s2">it&#39;s even a secret path dependent</p>
<p begin="02:40:03.910" end="02:40:07.801" style="s2">sequencing question where if you do it</p>
<p begin="02:40:05.290" end="02:40:09.940" style="s2">first for strike first strike</p>
<p begin="02:40:07.801" end="02:40:12.580" style="s2">transparency is very powerful and so you</p>
<p begin="02:40:09.940" end="02:40:16.301" style="s2">think about like you know um mr. Snowden</p>
<p begin="02:40:12.580" end="02:40:19.181" style="s2">against the NSA and then the NSA trying</p>

<p begin="02:40:20.740" end="02:40:28.150" style="s2">as and and I think a lot of it ends up</p>
<p begin="02:40:24.250" end="02:40:28.841" style="s2">having having that kind of an having</p>
<p begin="02:40:28.150" end="02:40:30.400" style="s2">sizes</p>

<p begin="02:40:38.591" end="02:40:49.471" style="s2">like that and that&#39;s yeah and and and so</p>
<p begin="02:40:45.431" end="02:40:52.841" style="s2">i I think um if I think in practice um</p>
<p begin="02:40:49.471" end="02:40:54.460" style="s2">full transparency it assumes people can</p>
<p begin="02:40:52.841" end="02:40:56.500" style="s2">pay attention to everything at once or</p>
<p begin="02:40:54.460" end="02:40:58.601" style="s2">equally and that seems that seems</p>
<p begin="02:40:56.500" end="02:41:01.120" style="s2">politically incorrect then even if you</p>
<p begin="02:40:58.601" end="02:41:03.370" style="s2">had this much greater transparency in</p>
<p begin="02:41:01.120" end="02:41:06.400" style="s2">all these ways through all these ways</p>
<p begin="02:41:03.370" end="02:41:08.801" style="s2">that that would seem creepy totalitarian</p>
<p begin="02:41:06.400" end="02:41:10.420" style="s2">if we if we you know if you stated in</p>
<p begin="02:41:08.801" end="02:41:11.790" style="s2">terms of the problem of violence right</p>
<p begin="02:41:10.420" end="02:41:15.660" style="s2">you can think of the trade-off between</p>
<p begin="02:41:11.790" end="02:41:19.391" style="s2">transparency and privacy as you know</p>
<p begin="02:41:15.660" end="02:41:22.841" style="s2">transparency is you know we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="02:41:19.391" end="02:41:25.960" style="s2">at everybody and therefore they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="02:41:22.841" end="02:41:27.641" style="s2">that violent but the state may be very</p>
<p begin="02:41:25.960" end="02:41:31.721" style="s2">violent and forcing all this</p>
<p begin="02:41:27.641" end="02:41:33.851" style="s2">transparency and privacy is you know um</p>
<p begin="02:41:31.721" end="02:41:37.750" style="s2">you get to have a gun and you get to do</p>
<p begin="02:41:33.851" end="02:41:40.360" style="s2">various dangerous things in the dark and</p>
<p begin="02:41:37.750" end="02:41:42.370" style="s2">no one knows what they are and so</p>
<p begin="02:41:40.360" end="02:41:44.920" style="s2">there&#39;s probably more violence on the</p>
<p begin="02:41:42.370" end="02:41:46.210" style="s2">individual level but then less control</p>
<p begin="02:41:44.920" end="02:41:48.341" style="s2">on the state and it&#39;s again this</p>
<p begin="02:41:46.210" end="02:41:50.650" style="s2">question of you know are you more scared</p>
<p begin="02:41:48.341" end="02:41:54.131" style="s2">of the violence of individuals or more</p>
<p begin="02:41:50.650" end="02:41:55.740" style="s2">scared of centralized violence and you</p>
<p begin="02:41:54.131" end="02:41:57.940" style="s2">probably one should not be too</p>
<p begin="02:41:55.740" end="02:42:00.761" style="s2">categorical or too absolute about this</p>
<p begin="02:41:57.940" end="02:42:02.110" style="s2">but you know it can it can show up in</p>
<p begin="02:42:00.761" end="02:42:04.690" style="s2">both places and that&#39;s why it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:42:02.110" end="02:42:06.940" style="s2">wickedly hard problem wickedly hard it</p>
<p begin="02:42:04.690" end="02:42:09.971" style="s2">does seem to be and I have to say I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:42:06.940" end="02:42:12.101" style="s2">just I&#39;ve started to hate the</p>
<p begin="02:42:09.971" end="02:42:14.460" style="s2">transparency discussion because if</p>
<p begin="02:42:12.101" end="02:42:17.170" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s a vote in twenty</p>

<p begin="02:42:19.690" end="02:42:23.771" style="s2">that constituted an argument now first</p>
<p begin="02:42:21.640" end="02:42:25.450" style="s2">of all one thing that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:42:23.771" end="02:42:26.920" style="s2">understand is that there are infections</p>
<p begin="02:42:25.450" end="02:42:29.771" style="s2">like Brucella that are actually</p>
<p begin="02:42:26.920" end="02:42:31.271" style="s2">accelerated by someone so it&#39;s comical</p>
<p begin="02:42:29.771" end="02:42:33.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not even true bleach is probably a</p>
<p begin="02:42:31.271" end="02:42:36.180" style="s2">better disinfectant but the idea that</p>
<p begin="02:42:33.640" end="02:42:39.670" style="s2">that constitutes an argument in our time</p>
<p begin="02:42:36.180" end="02:42:42.250" style="s2">to me speaks to the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:42:39.670" end="02:42:44.080" style="s2">living in a very strange moment where if</p>
<p begin="02:42:42.250" end="02:42:46.061" style="s2">you if you go back to Ecclesiastes and</p>
<p begin="02:42:44.080" end="02:42:48.400" style="s2">the inspiration for turn turn turn there</p>
<p begin="02:42:46.061" end="02:42:51.400" style="s2">was an idea that there was a purpose to</p>
<p begin="02:42:48.400" end="02:42:54.430" style="s2">everything and inclusion or exclusion</p>
<p begin="02:42:51.400" end="02:42:57.600" style="s2">were both needed a time to kill a time</p>
<p begin="02:42:54.430" end="02:43:00.360" style="s2">to die time to refrain from killing</p>
<p begin="02:42:57.600" end="02:43:04.000" style="s2">there does seem to be sort of an</p>
<p begin="02:43:00.360" end="02:43:06.190" style="s2">absolutist mania in which it would be</p>
<p begin="02:43:04.000" end="02:43:10.990" style="s2">hard to imagine writing a song about a</p>
<p begin="02:43:06.190" end="02:43:13.990" style="s2">time to kill in the modern era you know</p>
<p begin="02:43:10.990" end="02:43:16.480" style="s2">and likewise I&#39;m not positive that</p>
<p begin="02:43:13.990" end="02:43:18.760" style="s2">people recognize how imperative it is</p>
<p begin="02:43:16.480" end="02:43:20.410" style="s2">for a well-functioning government to</p>
<p begin="02:43:18.760" end="02:43:21.970" style="s2">have places where it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="02:43:20.410" end="02:43:24.850" style="s2">constantly account for it yeah</p>
<p begin="02:43:21.970" end="02:43:26.830" style="s2">everything you know if you sort of have</p>
<p begin="02:43:24.850" end="02:43:29.260" style="s2">no backroom deals</p>
<p begin="02:43:26.830" end="02:43:31.360" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s less corrupt but maybe</p>
<p begin="02:43:29.260" end="02:43:33.640" style="s2">nothing that&#39;s functional you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:43:31.360" end="02:43:36.430" style="s2">the US Supreme Court still doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:43:33.640" end="02:43:38.740" style="s2">televise its hearings and I suspect</p>
<p begin="02:43:36.430" end="02:43:41.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the right call even though</p>
<p begin="02:43:38.740" end="02:43:43.030" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s there&#39;s always ends</p>

<p begin="02:43:43.030" end="02:43:46.450" style="s2">think part of it is that you know if you</p>
<p begin="02:43:45.010" end="02:43:49.330" style="s2">know that everything is going to be</p>
<p begin="02:43:46.450" end="02:43:50.590" style="s2">transparent you will censor yourself and</p>
<p begin="02:43:49.330" end="02:43:52.450" style="s2">you won&#39;t say things so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="02:43:50.590" end="02:43:54.330" style="s2">the same thing happens in a transparent</p>
<p begin="02:43:52.450" end="02:43:56.620" style="s2">way maybe just stops happening</p>
<p begin="02:43:54.330" end="02:43:59.470" style="s2">altogether if you&#39;re if you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="02:43:56.620" end="02:44:02.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re a politician or aspiring</p>
<p begin="02:43:59.470" end="02:44:06.730" style="s2">politician on and you you want to you</p>
<p begin="02:44:02.920" end="02:44:08.200" style="s2">know you&#39;re not going to engage in bold</p>
<p begin="02:44:06.730" end="02:44:10.120" style="s2">ideas you&#39;re not going to experiment</p>
<p begin="02:44:08.200" end="02:44:11.021" style="s2">with different different ways about</p>

<p begin="02:44:11.021" end="02:44:17.920" style="s2">super conventional super curated and and</p>
<p begin="02:44:14.800" end="02:44:19.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s not like we get you know</p>
<p begin="02:44:17.920" end="02:44:20.980" style="s2">all the benefits of transparency with</p>
<p begin="02:44:19.480" end="02:44:22.570" style="s2">none of the costs they come with you</p>
<p begin="02:44:20.980" end="02:44:27.340" style="s2">know they come with a very very high</p>
<p begin="02:44:22.570" end="02:44:31.511" style="s2">cost on and and I I do</p>
<p begin="02:44:27.340" end="02:44:34.750" style="s2">you know I I do wonder if you know one</p>

<p begin="02:44:34.750" end="02:44:38.860" style="s2">generations in the u.s. is that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:44:38.860" end="02:44:43.120" style="s2">watch there&#39;s this you know great eye of</p>

<p begin="02:44:55.210" end="02:45:00.940" style="s2">um I suspect it really changes your</p>

<p begin="02:45:00.940" end="02:45:06.011" style="s2">moment where I wanted to make sure that</p>
<p begin="02:45:02.530" end="02:45:08.200" style="s2">my son didn&#39;t misbehave I toured him</p>
<p begin="02:45:06.011" end="02:45:10.030" style="s2">around our neighborhood and pointed out</p>
<p begin="02:45:08.200" end="02:45:12.570" style="s2">all of the cameras that would track</p>

<p begin="02:45:21.580" end="02:45:26.920" style="s2">stitched together there&#39;s an incredible</p>

<p begin="02:45:26.920" end="02:45:30.940" style="s2">surrounding us at all time let me ask</p>
<p begin="02:45:28.960" end="02:45:32.410" style="s2">you about one more theory before we</p>
<p begin="02:45:30.940" end="02:45:33.700" style="s2">break for this session we can have you</p>
<p begin="02:45:32.410" end="02:45:36.851" style="s2">on at another point it&#39;s been great</p>
<p begin="02:45:33.700" end="02:45:39.820" style="s2">talking are you familiar with the theory</p>
<p begin="02:45:36.851" end="02:45:43.120" style="s2">of Jennifer Freud&#39;s called institutional</p>

<p begin="02:45:43.120" end="02:45:45.931" style="s2">me but I don&#39;t know all the details so</p>
<p begin="02:45:44.500" end="02:45:48.250" style="s2">tell me a little bit about it well I</p>
<p begin="02:45:45.931" end="02:45:50.530" style="s2">don&#39;t know all the details either but I</p>
<p begin="02:45:48.250" end="02:45:53.530" style="s2">think what she isolated was that people</p>
<p begin="02:45:50.530" end="02:45:57.250" style="s2">who have been betrayed by institutions</p>
<p begin="02:45:53.530" end="02:46:00.730" style="s2">that have a responsibility of care like</p>
<p begin="02:45:57.250" end="02:46:03.730" style="s2">a hospital for example or if you trust a</p>

<p begin="02:46:03.730" end="02:46:08.440" style="s2">and then you find that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:46:05.340" end="02:46:10.630" style="s2">betrayed by that institution that had</p>
<p begin="02:46:08.440" end="02:46:15.011" style="s2">something of a like a principal agent</p>

<p begin="02:47:02.370" end="02:47:05.460" style="s2">what I&#39;d love to talk to you about in a</p>
<p begin="02:47:03.540" end="02:47:07.410" style="s2">future episode is what we&#39;re excited</p>
<p begin="02:47:05.460" end="02:47:10.080" style="s2">about about what comes next is there a</p>
<p begin="02:47:07.410" end="02:47:12.860" style="s2">way of waking up from this most</p>
<p begin="02:47:10.080" end="02:47:12.860" style="s2">gracefully</p>
<p begin="02:47:13.160" end="02:47:19.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know don&#39;t know about that it it</p>
<p begin="02:47:17.130" end="02:47:23.700" style="s2">strikes me that there are ways we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:47:19.770" end="02:47:27.750" style="s2">want to wake up and we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="02:47:23.700" end="02:47:33.570" style="s2">wake up in a way where it D energizes us</p>
<p begin="02:47:27.750" end="02:47:36.480" style="s2">and demotivates and so you know so I</p>
<p begin="02:47:33.570" end="02:47:38.070" style="s2">think I think one of the one of the ways</p>
<p begin="02:47:36.480" end="02:47:40.920" style="s2">I think these institutions worked was</p>
<p begin="02:47:38.070" end="02:47:42.840" style="s2">you know they they took care of people</p>
<p begin="02:47:40.920" end="02:47:45.720" style="s2">but it was also you know motivational</p>
<p begin="02:47:42.840" end="02:47:49.410" style="s2">and you study you get good grades you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:47:45.720" end="02:47:53.810" style="s2">succeed in our system right and and so</p>
<p begin="02:47:49.410" end="02:47:56.280" style="s2">one way you know when you sort of</p>
<p begin="02:47:53.810" end="02:47:58.860" style="s2">deconstruct these institutions you know</p>
<p begin="02:47:56.280" end="02:48:01.470" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of one one direction that I</p>
<p begin="02:47:58.860" end="02:48:03.600" style="s2">think is always very dangerous that it</p>
<p begin="02:48:01.470" end="02:48:06.570" style="s2">just shifts people into sort of a much</p>
<p begin="02:48:03.600" end="02:48:09.300" style="s2">more nihilistic very low-energy mode</p>
<p begin="02:48:06.570" end="02:48:12.780" style="s2">where it&#39;s just well there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="02:48:09.300" end="02:48:15.000" style="s2">nothing can be done and and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:48:12.780" end="02:48:17.730" style="s2">way I that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="02:48:15.000" end="02:48:20.220" style="s2">that I definitively do not want to wake</p>
<p begin="02:48:17.730" end="02:48:23.430" style="s2">people up so I think it has to always be</p>
<p begin="02:48:20.220" end="02:48:25.470" style="s2">coupled a little bit to you know um yeah</p>
<p begin="02:48:23.430" end="02:48:26.850" style="s2">that these paths that aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="02:48:25.470" end="02:48:28.680" style="s2">going anywhere and you shouldn&#39;t go down</p>
<p begin="02:48:26.850" end="02:48:30.750" style="s2">these paths but then there&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="02:48:28.680" end="02:48:33.330" style="s2">paths here that you take there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:48:30.750" end="02:48:36.390" style="s2">portal here that you need to you need to</p>
<p begin="02:48:33.330" end="02:48:39.780" style="s2">look at and if you uh if we are just</p>
<p begin="02:48:36.390" end="02:48:42.690" style="s2">saying all the paths are blocked you</p>
<p begin="02:48:39.780" end="02:48:44.430" style="s2">know I think probably the risk is people</p>
<p begin="02:48:42.690" end="02:48:46.110" style="s2">just sit down where they are and stop</p>
<p begin="02:48:44.430" end="02:48:48.060" style="s2">moving altogether and that&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="02:48:46.110" end="02:48:49.260" style="s2">feels like the very wrong way to wake</p>
<p begin="02:48:48.060" end="02:48:50.970" style="s2">people up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:48:49.260" end="02:48:53.850" style="s2">that sounds very wise let me just ask</p>
<p begin="02:48:50.970" end="02:48:57.029" style="s2">since you have been attached to some of</p>
<p begin="02:48:53.850" end="02:48:59.399" style="s2">the highest energy ideas whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:48:57.029" end="02:49:04.890" style="s2">you know crazy sounding stuff like</p>
<p begin="02:48:59.399" end="02:49:07.770" style="s2">seasteading or radical longevity or some</p>
<p begin="02:49:04.890" end="02:49:10.290" style="s2">other ideas from your background in</p>
<p begin="02:49:07.770" end="02:49:13.080" style="s2">venture capital and as as a technologist</p>
<p begin="02:49:10.290" end="02:49:15.870" style="s2">yourself what are the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:49:13.080" end="02:49:18.060" style="s2">most excited if we could move them back</p>
<p begin="02:49:15.870" end="02:49:21.149" style="s2">into the institutions where they</p>
<p begin="02:49:18.060" end="02:49:23.580" style="s2">probably belong to all this time what</p>
<p begin="02:49:21.149" end="02:49:25.830" style="s2">are what are the first sort of subjects</p>
<p begin="02:49:23.580" end="02:49:28.260" style="s2">and people that you would move back into</p>
<p begin="02:49:25.830" end="02:49:35.790" style="s2">institutional support to re-energize our</p>
<p begin="02:49:28.260" end="02:49:40.430" style="s2">society um people or programs well I do</p>
<p begin="02:49:35.790" end="02:49:44.279" style="s2">I do think there is something about</p>
<p begin="02:49:40.430" end="02:49:45.720" style="s2">basic science that has you know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:49:44.279" end="02:49:49.700" style="s2">all have this sort of for-profit</p>
<p begin="02:49:45.720" end="02:49:51.479" style="s2">character someone has this nonprofit</p>
<p begin="02:49:49.700" end="02:49:53.870" style="s2">character we&#39;re building up this</p>
<p begin="02:49:51.479" end="02:49:59.520" style="s2">knowledge base for all of humanity and</p>
<p begin="02:49:53.870" end="02:50:01.800" style="s2">and and so and so I don&#39;t yet know how</p>
<p begin="02:49:59.520" end="02:50:04.859" style="s2">we do basic science without some kind of</p>
<p begin="02:50:01.800" end="02:50:06.689" style="s2">institutional context and so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="02:50:04.859" end="02:50:09.420" style="s2">that&#39;s that would seem you know</p>
<p begin="02:50:06.689" end="02:50:10.859" style="s2">absolutely critical you know I I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="02:50:09.420" end="02:50:14.700" style="s2">interested in the you know problem of</p>
<p begin="02:50:10.859" end="02:50:17.040" style="s2">longevity radical life extension and you</p>
<p begin="02:50:14.700" end="02:50:19.229" style="s2">know my my sort of disappointment in the</p>
<p begin="02:50:17.040" end="02:50:21.149" style="s2">nonprofit institutions in nonprofit</p>
<p begin="02:50:19.229" end="02:50:23.100" style="s2">world has directed me more and more over</p>
<p begin="02:50:21.149" end="02:50:25.170" style="s2">the years to just invest in biotech</p>
<p begin="02:50:23.100" end="02:50:27.630" style="s2">companies and try to find these sort of</p>
<p begin="02:50:25.170" end="02:50:29.460" style="s2">on better functioning corporate</p>
<p begin="02:50:27.630" end="02:50:31.500" style="s2">solutions and then I always have this</p>
<p begin="02:50:29.460" end="02:50:33.930" style="s2">worry in the back of my my head that</p>
<p begin="02:50:31.500" end="02:50:36.270" style="s2">maybe there are these basic research</p>
<p begin="02:50:33.930" end="02:50:37.890" style="s2">problems that they&#39;re being sidestepped</p>
<p begin="02:50:36.270" end="02:50:41.069" style="s2">because they&#39;re four to hard so I I</p>
<p begin="02:50:37.890" end="02:50:43.890" style="s2">think I think basic science is is one</p>
<p begin="02:50:41.069" end="02:50:45.660" style="s2">that that you you&#39;d have to do and but</p>
<p begin="02:50:43.890" end="02:50:46.920" style="s2">you have to somehow also reform the</p>
<p begin="02:50:45.660" end="02:50:49.109" style="s2">institutions so you don&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="02:50:46.920" end="02:50:51.960" style="s2">Gresham&#39;s law where the you know the</p>
<p begin="02:50:49.109" end="02:50:53.310" style="s2">politicians replace the scientists that</p>
<p begin="02:50:51.960" end="02:50:56.160" style="s2">sounds like a great wedding I was very</p>
<p begin="02:50:53.310" end="02:50:58.050" style="s2">surprised to see that your friend Aubrey</p>
<p begin="02:50:56.160" end="02:51:00.660" style="s2">de Grey who you funded to sort of get</p>
<p begin="02:50:58.050" end="02:51:03.061" style="s2">the radical on everything was in the</p>
<p begin="02:51:00.660" end="02:51:04.830" style="s2">news for having solved a hard math</p>
<p begin="02:51:03.061" end="02:51:07.021" style="s2">problem in his spare time that nobody</p>
<p begin="02:51:04.830" end="02:51:08.820" style="s2">even knew he was working on and so it</p>
<p begin="02:51:07.021" end="02:51:11.910" style="s2">seems like even though people would</p>
<p begin="02:51:08.820" end="02:51:14.101" style="s2">treat him as crazy he certainly has a</p>
<p begin="02:51:11.910" end="02:51:15.751" style="s2">lot on the ball and probably is the</p>
<p begin="02:51:14.101" end="02:51:17.400" style="s2">exactly the kind of a person who might</p>
<p begin="02:51:15.751" end="02:51:19.771" style="s2">energize a department even if you might</p>
<p begin="02:51:17.400" end="02:51:21.570" style="s2">infuriate if you can get him back in you</p>
<p begin="02:51:19.771" end="02:51:23.641" style="s2">would if you were able to get him back</p>
<p begin="02:51:21.570" end="02:51:25.650" style="s2">and I think you&#39;d be able to solve a lot</p>
<p begin="02:51:23.641" end="02:51:27.690" style="s2">of problems well Peter it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="02:51:25.650" end="02:51:29.580" style="s2">absolutely fantastic having you thank</p>
