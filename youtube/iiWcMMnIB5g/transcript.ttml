<p begin="00:00:59.820" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">topic for me it&#39;s not something I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:08.549" style="s2">strong emotional attachment to either</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">way aye sir and equally I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.549" end="00:01:13.710" style="s2">deep learning or whatever on the topic</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.250" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">either so I speak very much as a lay</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.710" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">person on the subject my the the quote</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:23.220" style="s2">that&#39;s often associated with Marxism the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">idea of from each according to their</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.220" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">- sorry from each according to their</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">abilities sorry to each according to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">their needs that is an axiom which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">don&#39;t think many reasonable people would</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">actually disagree with and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">implementation I accept has been to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">understate a bit problematic over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">over the last century or so right the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">attempts at the attempts of actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">implementation but and I know Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">Peterson gives this whole argument a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">really bad rap that that wasn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">Marxism but I but I think there is some</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:51.869" style="s2">I think there was a good deal of truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">in that argument that it wasn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.869" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">Marxism I can&#39;t believe that Marx if he</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">looked at that would think yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">what I had in mind I just I don&#39;t I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">I can&#39;t believe that so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">really I think all I have to say on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">subject I will if I if I was to go on I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">would really just I think repeat that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">basic thing so that&#39;s that&#39;s really I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">think all I have to say there&#39;s no need</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">to me to take up any more time</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">thank you would you like to go Brent or</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">would you like me to go you go ahead all</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">right my ideas on Marxism and communism</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.700" end="00:02:27.630" style="s2">is ironically I haven&#39;t read a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">the actual literature I&#39;ve watched a ton</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.630" end="00:02:31.500" style="s2">of YouTube contents and videos because</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:33.870" style="s2">that&#39;s what can now go into my brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.500" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">more so than the written word but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.870" end="00:02:37.590" style="s2">understand I mean I learned about it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:39.930" style="s2">school and I believe in a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.590" end="00:02:42.300" style="s2">principles I think there&#39;s a reason it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.930" end="00:02:45.660" style="s2">has stuck around in an ideology that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.300" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">people love the the beauty of it but in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.660" end="00:02:48.989" style="s2">order to honor that you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">honor that when it&#39;s been implemented</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.989" end="00:02:53.970" style="s2">it&#39;s been implemented with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:55.769" style="s2">violence and horrific outcomes and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.970" end="00:02:58.260" style="s2">can&#39;t ignore that at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.769" end="00:02:59.850" style="s2">think people attribute a lot of death to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.260" end="00:03:03.300" style="s2">communism and they don&#39;t attribute death</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.850" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">to capitalism and capitalism for me is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.300" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">much more hot-button topic the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:08.850" style="s2">we&#39;re all in it for the fish and water</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">so we don&#39;t attribute all of the deaths</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.850" end="00:03:12.690" style="s2">from cancer all of the deaths from not</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">having access to medical care all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.690" end="00:03:18.150" style="s2">deaths from having non proper nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:19.739" style="s2">and and like we just don&#39;t attribute</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:21.630" style="s2">those to capitalism even if they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.739" end="00:03:25.610" style="s2">directly related to somebody seeking</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.630" end="00:03:27.930" style="s2">profit over help you know common humans</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.610" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">hope I don&#39;t you man&#39;s their their</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.930" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">common fellow humans and so I think a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:36.690" style="s2">lot I&#39;ve been talking for years before</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">even finding a game be about dismantling</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.690" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">capitalism which was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">creating game be out of from great game</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.359" style="s2">a and when everyone here is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">like that you must be a communist you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.359" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">must be a socialist might be trying must</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:51.829" style="s2">be trying to recreate communism and to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:56.340" style="s2">degree I am I&#39;m trying to create a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.829" end="00:03:59.310" style="s2">common technology that is safe enough to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">try that isn&#39;t ever forced and so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.310" end="00:04:02.670" style="s2">to me I can see the downfalls in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:05.630" style="s2">systems that have come before and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.670" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">positives and I seek to create something</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.630" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">that harnesses the positives without the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">negatives which means you always have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">be open for what is failing and what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:19.109" style="s2">not working and seek truth over what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">want or we want to be the truth that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.109" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">like it just isn&#39;t implemented right</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like well is it being implemented</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:26.010" style="s2">what are we learning and how can we how</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:28.710" style="s2">can we improve it and so that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.010" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">my answer to that question today at 2:00</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.710" end="00:04:42.090" style="s2">p.m. okay my turn my life mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:44.550" style="s2">I&#39;m on the same page as both of you so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.090" end="00:04:51.980" style="s2">this isn&#39;t gonna be that difficult I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:55.830" style="s2">glad there&#39;s not lots of people but mmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.980" end="00:04:57.990" style="s2">for me what it comes down to is just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.830" end="00:05:00.810" style="s2">the culture war largely has this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.990" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">aversion to the word Marxism and Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.810" end="00:05:04.890" style="s2">and communism are different things and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:08.790" style="s2">there&#39;s different types of Marxism right</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.890" end="00:05:10.110" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a monolith and you both</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.790" end="00:05:13.290" style="s2">admit to some extent that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.110" end="00:05:15.720" style="s2">fully versed in it I&#39;m reluctant to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.290" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">I&#39;m versed in it too but but my</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.720" end="00:05:20.640" style="s2">background is sociology and so so</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">Marxism as a critical approach is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.640" end="00:05:25.590" style="s2">actually a foundational kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">cornerstone of sociology like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.590" end="00:05:30.440" style="s2">really do it do it without Marxism there</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:33.420" style="s2">are other approaches and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.440" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">anti-marxist sociologists but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.420" end="00:05:37.950" style="s2">part of the discourse right so so people</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:40.200" style="s2">should appreciate that so it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.950" end="00:05:42.450" style="s2">be a scare a scare word right because</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.200" end="00:05:46.140" style="s2">there&#39;s lots you can look into about</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.450" end="00:05:48.690" style="s2">Marxism not as an ideology but as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:51.900" style="s2">academic kind of approach and critique</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.690" end="00:05:54.630" style="s2">that actually dissolves a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.900" end="00:05:56.310" style="s2">misunderstandings in tensions above the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.630" end="00:06:00.270" style="s2">terms and between capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.310" end="00:06:03.690" style="s2">socialism and there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.270" end="00:06:05.580" style="s2">numbers it&#39;s probably debatable but</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.690" end="00:06:07.530" style="s2">there are numbers on the death toll of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.580" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">capitalism too right because there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.530" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">there is a kind of death toll it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:16.950" style="s2">not as direct or or a kind of concrete</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:20.490" style="s2">as other forms of genocide or</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.950" end="00:06:23.940" style="s2">annihilation um but it does add up and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.490" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">it and it is comparable so mm-hmm you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.940" end="00:06:28.760" style="s2">know whatever label we we slap on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">system there&#39;s something else going on</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.760" end="00:06:33.210" style="s2">sociologically like-likes okay like</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:35.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no pure communism</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.210" end="00:06:37.530" style="s2">there&#39;s no pure capitalism or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:40.200" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s mixtures of all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.530" end="00:06:43.140" style="s2">things and they and they co-opt each</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.200" end="00:06:46.530" style="s2">other right in order to represent</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.530" end="00:06:51.630" style="s2">Germany was called socialist but it</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.660" end="00:06:55.830" style="s2">wasn&#39;t socialist and in any coherent way</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.630" end="00:06:58.980" style="s2">right it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a label and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.830" end="00:07:01.290" style="s2">there&#39;s just you know that this is only</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.980" end="00:07:05.220" style="s2">a hot-button issue for me insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.290" end="00:07:06.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a major dogma of kind of fans of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.220" end="00:07:09.090" style="s2">the intellectual dark web to be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.690" end="00:07:12.630" style="s2">anti-marxist right to dismiss the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.090" end="00:07:14.670" style="s2">concept to say Marxism killed so many</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.630" end="00:07:18.330" style="s2">people and it&#39;s been tried and failed</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.670" end="00:07:20.370" style="s2">hmm it&#39;s just a straw man really in to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.330" end="00:07:22.920" style="s2">some extent a dog whistle too because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.370" end="00:07:25.110" style="s2">detracts from like the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.920" end="00:07:28.380" style="s2">seriousness of the discourse of Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.110" end="00:07:32.100" style="s2">which is about a class analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.380" end="00:07:41.130" style="s2">alienation about capital the way capital</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.100" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">works so as I said I&#39;m not I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.130" end="00:07:45.600" style="s2">expert but I feel like I could talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:47.430" style="s2">about this Burnett for an hour because</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.600" end="00:07:50.610" style="s2">there is a lot of depth there right</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.430" end="00:07:53.310" style="s2">there&#39;s publications like Jacobin which</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.610" end="00:07:56.270" style="s2">are explicitly marxist</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.310" end="00:07:59.700" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s their kind of program and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.270" end="00:08:04.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s worth it&#39;s worth reading right</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.700" end="00:08:07.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not worth dismissing so so when it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.050" end="00:08:09.540" style="s2">comes to game B the issue is not Oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:12.510" style="s2">Marxism is game a or a game be like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.540" end="00:08:14.850" style="s2">clearly capitalism is kind of game a but</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.510" end="00:08:18.180" style="s2">Marxism as a kind of critical approach</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.850" end="00:08:19.830" style="s2">has you know historical components that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.180" end="00:08:22.650" style="s2">we could consider part of game a like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.830" end="00:08:28.620" style="s2">obviously failed communism as part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.650" end="00:08:30.660" style="s2">game a but but the idea maybe ideas the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.620" end="00:08:33.210" style="s2">more abstract ideas behind Marxism of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:35.400" style="s2">historical materialism of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.210" end="00:08:40.650" style="s2">planetary evolution of kind of metabolic</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.650" end="00:08:47.150" style="s2">these are these are kind of concepts</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.410" end="00:08:50.910" style="s2">that that take us from game a to game B</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.150" end="00:08:51.990" style="s2">ostensibly so so it&#39;s it&#39;s a discourse</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:08:54.899" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.990" end="00:08:56.790" style="s2">Marxism as a as a tool kit helps us get</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.899" end="00:08:58.620" style="s2">there helps us cross over into a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.790" end="00:09:02.070" style="s2">paradigm that&#39;s actually kind of part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.620" end="00:09:05.100" style="s2">the part of the premise of original</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.070" end="00:09:06.680" style="s2">Marxism is that mmm history is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.100" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">long-term</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.680" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">struggle that plays out through</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:15.240" style="s2">dialectic and that in the end whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">that end is you know 25 years after when</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.240" end="00:09:20.070" style="s2">Marx was writing or 200 years after Marx</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.250" end="00:09:22.770" style="s2">was writing that on the on the macro</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.070" end="00:09:24.990" style="s2">scale globalization is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.770" end="00:09:27.450" style="s2">evolutionary process and it&#39;s unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.990" end="00:09:29.580" style="s2">in a certain direction there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.450" end="00:09:32.760" style="s2">teleology behind it so there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.580" end="00:09:35.850" style="s2">difference between um kind of picking up</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.760" end="00:09:37.649" style="s2">on that as like a prescription for what</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.850" end="00:09:40.830" style="s2">we should do and just a description of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.649" end="00:09:43.890" style="s2">what&#39;s happening so that in itself kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.830" end="00:09:48.470" style="s2">of reinforces agency and structured</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.890" end="00:09:50.880" style="s2">debates but but we can&#39;t we can&#39;t escape</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.470" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">trying to address address this</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.880" end="00:09:55.790" style="s2">globalization question and and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">analyze it properly you need to keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.790" end="00:10:03.810" style="s2">Marxism in the discourse so to speak hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:05.430" style="s2">so one thing that comes up in game B</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.810" end="00:10:07.980" style="s2">sometimes is Robert Wright&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.430" end="00:10:10.920" style="s2">nonzero and I wouldn&#39;t say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.980" end="00:10:12.600" style="s2">that&#39;s Marxist but but it it it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.920" end="00:10:14.339" style="s2">dovetails with what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.600" end="00:10:16.230" style="s2">of kind of a lot a long term</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.339" end="00:10:18.300" style="s2">evolutionary approach that posits the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.230" end="00:10:22.760" style="s2">kind of convergence of human societies</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.300" end="00:10:25.950" style="s2">and a kind of a synthesis of differences</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.760" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">but but with with the economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.950" end="00:10:31.470" style="s2">inequality in class struggle today of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:34.140" style="s2">course and the financial crisis a decade</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.470" end="00:10:37.950" style="s2">ago like the the topic of Menem of of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.140" end="00:10:40.440" style="s2">Marxism is very salient like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.950" end="00:10:44.070" style="s2">very important it shouldn&#39;t be dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.440" end="00:10:46.589" style="s2">by people who could you know take a kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.070" end="00:10:47.970" style="s2">of straw man version of it I think I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.589" end="00:10:51.089" style="s2">think we&#39;re all in the same page with</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.970" end="00:10:52.680" style="s2">that homie I think I think absolutely to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.089" end="00:10:54.180" style="s2">get behind that yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.680" end="00:10:56.190" style="s2">actually what put me off - and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.180" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">in the end was this ridiculous lying</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.190" end="00:10:59.970" style="s2">spot he has you know what I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:01.949" style="s2">anything socialist is a one way to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.970" end="00:11:05.010" style="s2">to the GU legs you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.949" end="00:11:05.410" style="s2">just for someone who sells themselves as</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.410" end="00:11:11.079" style="s2">all about peeling back you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:15.000" style="s2">mean layers of obscurity to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.079" end="00:11:17.589" style="s2">truth is his his live dismissal of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.000" end="00:11:19.660" style="s2">Marxism I just thought it doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.589" end="00:11:21.550" style="s2">it&#39;s always really bothered me about him</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.660" end="00:11:22.930" style="s2">because I followed him for a while I</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.550" end="00:11:24.750" style="s2">mean I was really really into him for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.930" end="00:11:26.709" style="s2">while for a few months I was you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.750" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">absorbing everything I could have his</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.709" end="00:11:31.509" style="s2">and but but more and more and more that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:32.709" style="s2">persistent message really started I even</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.509" end="00:11:39.129" style="s2">made a video about it no one ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.709" end="00:11:42.430" style="s2">watched it but I even made a you said</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.129" end="00:11:44.139" style="s2">there Brent and in a way just restate</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.430" end="00:11:46.689" style="s2">them but just just for that just for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.139" end="00:11:48.220" style="s2">sake of clarity because I mean I think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.689" end="00:11:53.050" style="s2">agree with what you were saying that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.220" end="00:11:54.939" style="s2">Marx is not really a prescription for</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.050" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">how to run the world more it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.939" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">analysis of what has gone before what</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:02.350" style="s2">its failings are you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:04.329" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tool for critiquing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.350" end="00:12:06.759" style="s2">lens through which to view things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.329" end="00:12:08.290" style="s2">not a prescription of how to do things</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.759" end="00:12:11.649" style="s2">yes it is that essentially what you were</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.290" end="00:12:13.660" style="s2">saying yeah no doubt there&#39;s factions</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.649" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">that take it more seriously as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.660" end="00:12:17.529" style="s2">prescription like if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:19.870" style="s2">Jacobean or if you&#39;re into labor and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.529" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">union organizing you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.870" end="00:12:23.889" style="s2">doing the type of praxis right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:25.449" style="s2">putting that knowledge into action yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.889" end="00:12:27.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s definitely a part of it the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.449" end="00:12:30.459" style="s2">question is like like like to what</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.880" end="00:12:32.709" style="s2">extent is it healthy is it is it true is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.459" end="00:12:35.560" style="s2">it viable right these are these are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.709" end="00:12:38.439" style="s2">more practical questions but but as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.560" end="00:12:40.420" style="s2">discourse it&#39;s there&#39;s such a complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.439" end="00:12:43.180" style="s2">history there&#39;s there&#39;s dozens and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.420" end="00:12:46.329" style="s2">dozens of very famous Marxist thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.180" end="00:12:51.309" style="s2">right like like Frantz Fanon or or Louie</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.329" end="00:12:53.620" style="s2">althrough say and hmm you know or a more</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.309" end="00:12:57.430" style="s2">more contemporary thinkers like like</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.519" end="00:13:58.279" style="s2">it&#39;s been picking up a lot of young</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.930" end="00:13:59.810" style="s2">people who are interested you know what</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.279" end="00:14:01.850" style="s2">I mean they want to learn more about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.810" end="00:14:04.820" style="s2">and people like Richard Wolford I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.850" end="00:14:06.200" style="s2">yeah I really I&#39;m a big fan of his it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.820" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">the only one I know out of all of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.200" end="00:14:17.390" style="s2">names you tube channel because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:21.459" style="s2">disagree that I don&#39;t think that worker</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.390" end="00:14:21.459" style="s2">cooperatives are solution for the future</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.329" end="00:14:30.140" style="s2">this was not very Omega of me but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.070" end="00:14:32.420" style="s2">rivalries isn&#39;t it that workers unions</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.140" end="00:14:34.640" style="s2">thing is rivalries it&#39;s it&#39;s workers</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.420" end="00:14:36.260" style="s2">versus management rather than start</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.640" end="00:14:38.390" style="s2">figuring out some way to collaborate and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.260" end="00:14:41.000" style="s2">you know share a vision of where we all</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.390" end="00:14:42.829" style="s2">want to go together its its its rival</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.000" end="00:14:45.140" style="s2">risks then yeah for that reason I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.829" end="00:14:47.390" style="s2">like it is not gonna be I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.140" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">if we had implemented it two or three</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.390" end="00:14:52.670" style="s2">decades ago awesome but I&#39;d like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:53.899" style="s2">time it would take to implement that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.670" end="00:14:55.250" style="s2">then there&#39;s not real I&#39;m like it</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.899" end="00:14:57.949" style="s2">doesn&#39;t deal with any of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.250" end="00:14:59.779" style="s2">economy issues like what about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.949" end="00:15:01.430" style="s2">rivalry between the worker cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.779" end="00:15:03.649" style="s2">and how do you how do you compete on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.430" end="00:15:05.720" style="s2">global scale and how do you do you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.649" end="00:15:07.339" style="s2">any of that but I do like but did he I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.720" end="00:15:08.630" style="s2">just watch me because I was when you in</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.339" end="00:15:10.370" style="s2">to mention that Marxism is different</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.630" end="00:15:12.170" style="s2">than communism I was like I&#39;m gonna need</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.370" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">a refresher course and so I was just</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.170" end="00:15:16.190" style="s2">watching this 10-minute spiel on on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:19.250" style="s2">difference between them and how Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.190" end="00:15:21.110" style="s2">is everywhere and that he&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.250" end="00:15:23.779" style="s2">know that management doesn&#39;t take into</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.110" end="00:15:26.060" style="s2">consideration the worker which is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.779" end="00:15:27.850" style="s2">the biggest body that&#39;s involved and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.060" end="00:15:30.040" style="s2">like what about the user the consumer</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.850" end="00:15:32.140" style="s2">they&#39;re a bigger number</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.040" end="00:15:34.020" style="s2">is involved and to me a consumer</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.140" end="00:15:36.820" style="s2">cooperative has more power because where</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.020" end="00:15:39.550" style="s2">we buy things for more places than we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.820" end="00:15:41.260" style="s2">work we work one place maybe and I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.550" end="00:15:44.530" style="s2">like to work no place like I would like</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.260" end="00:15:46.750" style="s2">to not have labor or be the center of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.530" end="00:15:49.060" style="s2">life or other people&#39;s lives but but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.750" end="00:15:50.380" style="s2">do find him very brilliant I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.060" end="00:15:52.500" style="s2">agree with his take on how we actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.380" end="00:15:58.180" style="s2">solve things</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.500" end="00:16:01.380" style="s2">yeah I think like I think to be like</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.180" end="00:16:04.150" style="s2">like to try to fulfill some kind of pure</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.380" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">Marxists economic program like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.150" end="00:16:09.730" style="s2">maybe wolf is is doing might you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:12.310" style="s2">might be a bit dysfunctional in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.730" end="00:16:15.430" style="s2">different ways so I don&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.310" end="00:16:21.370" style="s2">subscribe you know to everything he says</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.430" end="00:16:22.960" style="s2">in particular but I I mean I go back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.370" end="00:16:25.420" style="s2">my core point like it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.960" end="00:16:27.250" style="s2">essential part of sociology as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.420" end="00:16:30.610" style="s2">discipline like how can you study</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.250" end="00:16:32.500" style="s2">society without understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.610" end="00:16:35.650" style="s2">richness of these khans these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.500" end="00:16:38.440" style="s2">and right and why why Marx and Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.650" end="00:16:42.820" style="s2">is regarded as a kind of important</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.440" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">intellectual legacy and this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.820" end="00:16:47.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a broader point here as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:50.890" style="s2">isn&#39;t there that it&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.590" end="00:16:53.350" style="s2">between ideologies and ideas right that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.890" end="00:16:54.760" style="s2">you know if you label yourself a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.350" end="00:16:56.830" style="s2">then you have to agree with everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.760" end="00:16:58.150" style="s2">that there is in that doctrine Ryan</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.830" end="00:16:59.710" style="s2">anything that contradicts it you also</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.150" end="00:17:02.890" style="s2">mentioned you can&#39;t agree with and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.710" end="00:17:04.449" style="s2">it&#39;s the ability to say yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.890" end="00:17:06.100" style="s2">about that but that&#39;s not good about</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.449" end="00:17:07.390" style="s2">that and that&#39;s good about this or even</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.100" end="00:17:09.220" style="s2">though it&#39;s a completely contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.390" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">you know set of philosophies in many</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.220" end="00:17:12.430" style="s2">ways but actually there is some</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">synthesis to be made between this</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.430" end="00:17:16.150" style="s2">element of this and this element of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:18.100" style="s2">that would work really well and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.150" end="00:17:20.050" style="s2">the it&#39;s having the intellectual freedom</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.100" end="00:17:22.510" style="s2">to be able to do that right to drop</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.050" end="00:17:24.459" style="s2">ideas when actually okay this works best</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.510" end="00:17:24.850" style="s2">than that and just just that&#39;s it just</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.459" end="00:17:27.130" style="s2">drop it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.850" end="00:17:28.600" style="s2">you know the people don&#39;t do that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.130" end="00:17:31.210" style="s2">hang on and this is what I mean about</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.600" end="00:17:33.160" style="s2">the differences and ideas right ideology</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.210" end="00:17:35.740" style="s2">is when it&#39;s stuck and it&#39;s become a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.160" end="00:17:37.480" style="s2">part of your identity it&#39;s not just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.740" end="00:17:39.010" style="s2">not just a tool that you hang on to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.480" end="00:17:41.050" style="s2">until it&#39;s not useful anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.010" end="00:17:43.809" style="s2">actually integrated into into your</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.050" end="00:17:46.269" style="s2">identity so that I think this is why</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.809" end="00:17:47.739" style="s2">this becomes such a hot-button issue for</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.269" end="00:17:49.599" style="s2">things like jordan peterson fans right</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.739" end="00:17:52.179" style="s2">because they feel so much gratitude and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.599" end="00:17:54.009" style="s2">loyalty to him for you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.179" end="00:17:55.929" style="s2">he&#39;s done for them in terms of waking</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.009" end="00:17:57.700" style="s2">them up and helping them find richness</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.929" end="00:17:59.349" style="s2">and meaning and paths to go down in</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.700" end="00:18:01.419" style="s2">their lives and I think he has genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.349" end="00:18:05.080" style="s2">helped a lot of people in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.419" end="00:18:07.450" style="s2">regard and so when he gets on this thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.080" end="00:18:10.869" style="s2">about marx&#39;s and they have to in a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.450" end="00:18:13.570" style="s2">jump on board with that because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.869" end="00:18:15.340" style="s2">in their own way ideologically possessed</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.570" end="00:18:16.889" style="s2">by jordan peterson who preaches against</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.340" end="00:18:20.769" style="s2">the ideological possession</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.889" end="00:18:22.330" style="s2">yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.769" end="00:18:23.649" style="s2">and that was part of what the richard</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.330" end="00:18:25.599" style="s2">wolf thing when i talked about and I had</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.649" end="00:18:28.299" style="s2">made a note of it as well that like if</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.599" end="00:18:29.919" style="s2">you&#39;re attributing Marx&#39;s ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.299" end="00:18:33.519" style="s2">communism and therefore all of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.919" end="00:18:34.809" style="s2">deaths from communism to Marxism that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.519" end="00:18:37.450" style="s2">you kind of also need to do that with</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.809" end="00:18:39.460" style="s2">Christianity right that like Jesus is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.450" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">what Jesus spoke about if you believe</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.460" end="00:18:42.669" style="s2">that that was a real person was</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.080" end="00:18:46.210" style="s2">beautiful like who disagrees with what</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.669" end="00:18:48.729" style="s2">Jesus said but the Crusades all of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.210" end="00:18:52.629" style="s2">things that happen in order to push</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.729" end="00:18:54.909" style="s2">forth that ideology is horrific and yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.629" end="00:18:56.139" style="s2">no one in the West even people who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.909" end="00:18:57.729" style="s2">atheist or like well we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.139" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">attribute one to the other right if</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.729" end="00:19:03.219" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re Christian you were for</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:04.749" style="s2">the Crusades and that&#39;s the and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.219" end="00:19:06.700" style="s2">other one I have down here is Darwin and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.749" end="00:19:08.529" style="s2">evolution like this idea that because</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.700" end="00:19:10.929" style="s2">someone came up with an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.529" end="00:19:14.440" style="s2">they&#39;re the like gospel truth when they</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.929" end="00:19:15.759" style="s2">don&#39;t have today&#39;s understanding I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.440" end="00:19:18.369" style="s2">Marx died over a hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.759" end="00:19:21.789" style="s2">Darwin died you know around that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.369" end="00:19:23.529" style="s2">long ago and they didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.789" end="00:19:25.179" style="s2">internet they didn&#39;t have globalization</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.529" end="00:19:27.399" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.179" end="00:19:30.249" style="s2">have now how could they possibly foresee</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.399" end="00:19:32.109" style="s2">for see into the future what what these</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.249" end="00:19:33.940" style="s2">things are and so we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.109" end="00:19:40.239" style="s2">take it and apply it which means not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.940" end="00:19:43.149" style="s2">treating it as gospel yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.239" end="00:19:47.589" style="s2">Peterson refused to debate Richard</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.149" end="00:19:49.029" style="s2">Wolffe and you know I&#39;m not you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.589" end="00:19:50.979" style="s2">there&#39;s no guarantees that would have</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.029" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">been interesting or or fruitful anyways</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.979" end="00:19:56.589" style="s2">but Peterson did debate jus Jack and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:57.790" style="s2">that was very telling that was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.589" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">watershed moment for</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.790" end="00:20:03.820" style="s2">people because yeah what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:06.010" style="s2">Eric about how you were you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.820" end="00:20:08.260" style="s2">a fan of Peterson for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.010" end="00:20:10.360" style="s2">then your your interest waned as these</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.260" end="00:20:12.460" style="s2">kind of red flags came up I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.360" end="00:20:16.060" style="s2">something interest very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.460" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">me because from the very beginning uh I</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.060" end="00:20:19.750" style="s2">felt like I could recognize what</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:21.580" style="s2">Peterson was right about and what he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.750" end="00:20:23.110" style="s2">interesting about and the things he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.580" end="00:20:27.160" style="s2">flat wrong about and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.110" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">pathological aggression towards people</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.160" end="00:20:33.220" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t like like Foucault right when</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:35.470" style="s2">you know yeah yeah whatever like he just</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.220" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">goes to town on these people like like</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.470" end="00:20:39.190" style="s2">short of calling them fascists he says</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.600" end="00:20:42.120" style="s2">they&#39;re the kind of most reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.190" end="00:20:44.800" style="s2">dangerous people in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.120" end="00:20:45.700" style="s2">like like hyperbole would be an</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.800" end="00:20:49.690" style="s2">understatement</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.700" end="00:20:51.370" style="s2">in that case right but it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.690" end="00:20:53.560" style="s2">these things were obvious to me because</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.370" end="00:20:57.880" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s just so anti sociological</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.560" end="00:21:00.610" style="s2">like I just on the face of it um but but</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.880" end="00:21:02.740" style="s2">it&#39;s taken people so long to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.610" end="00:21:06.100" style="s2">catch up to that because he is so</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.740" end="00:21:09.250" style="s2">personal persuasive and he is so kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.100" end="00:21:12.370" style="s2">well-read in his own areas of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.250" end="00:21:14.980" style="s2">um and you don&#39;t you don&#39;t have to like</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.370" end="00:21:16.390" style="s2">be a super fan of Foucault but like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.980" end="00:21:19.240" style="s2">just like with Marx like you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.390" end="00:21:22.630" style="s2">recognize his place in intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.240" end="00:21:25.060" style="s2">history and you know and respect that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.630" end="00:21:27.490" style="s2">path it&#39;s the same thing with with</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.060" end="00:21:29.620" style="s2">Chomsky like like Chomsky debated</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.490" end="00:21:31.240" style="s2">Foucault they&#39;re able to respect each</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.620" end="00:21:33.970" style="s2">other and appreciate each other to some</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.240" end="00:21:36.190" style="s2">extent and then Sam Harris debates Noam</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.970" end="00:21:38.530" style="s2">Chomsky and it&#39;s like totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.190" end="00:21:40.750" style="s2">disrespectful it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.530" end="00:21:45.190" style="s2">following um</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.750" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">kind of role alpha or whatever like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.190" end="00:21:53.220" style="s2">just projecting on to Chomsky and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:56.260" style="s2">you know yeah it&#39;s very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.220" end="00:21:57.880" style="s2">unprofessional adolescent and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.260" end="00:21:59.230" style="s2">expect more from something like Sam</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.880" end="00:22:02.830" style="s2">Harris where Jordan Peterson for that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.230" end="00:22:04.150" style="s2">matter yeah I mean there&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.830" end="00:22:05.770" style="s2">that happens after period so I&#39;m I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.150" end="00:22:07.420" style="s2">Sam Harris is a really good example of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.770" end="00:22:09.070" style="s2">this he sold a lot of books he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.420" end="00:22:11.230" style="s2">lot of subscribers on his channel</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.070" end="00:22:11.559" style="s2">lots of patreon contributors all of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.230" end="00:22:15.220" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.559" end="00:22:17.980" style="s2">malarkey and so he&#39;s kind of fenced</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.220" end="00:22:19.480" style="s2">himself into a particular position right</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.980" end="00:22:21.850" style="s2">you know he can&#39;t he can only really</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.480" end="00:22:24.639" style="s2">talk about things from you know even if</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.850" end="00:22:26.499" style="s2">he was to suddenly change his mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.639" end="00:22:28.059" style="s2">dramatically about something profound</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.499" end="00:22:30.549" style="s2">and important he couldn&#39;t really say so</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.059" end="00:22:32.139" style="s2">because that&#39;s it that&#39;s that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.549" end="00:22:35.499" style="s2">his living gone you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.139" end="00:22:38.799" style="s2">so it&#39;s a real danger of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.499" end="00:22:41.379" style="s2">popular is that you you it traps you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.799" end="00:22:43.179" style="s2">into continuing to be what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.379" end="00:22:44.919" style="s2">before it stops you from evolving so</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.179" end="00:22:46.899" style="s2">it&#39;s another thing I wanted to I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.919" end="00:22:48.820" style="s2">to mention to you on this mention that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.899" end="00:22:50.350" style="s2">can&#39;t remember where I heard this but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.820" end="00:22:53.409" style="s2">thought it was a really interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.350" end="00:22:55.990" style="s2">and it fits into the sort of Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.409" end="00:22:59.139" style="s2">being the antithesis of and so someone</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.990" end="00:23:01.149" style="s2">said to me that Peterson&#39;s wisdom if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.139" end="00:23:03.159" style="s2">want to call it that comes from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.149" end="00:23:05.289" style="s2">that he has obviously at some point</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.159" end="00:23:08.799" style="s2">looked into the abyss right and had to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.289" end="00:23:10.570" style="s2">deal with that right whereas the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.799" end="00:23:12.369" style="s2">of someone like Charles Eisenstein for</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.570" end="00:23:15.009" style="s2">example who I really like I&#39;m a big fan</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.369" end="00:23:17.499" style="s2">of his is the exact opposite his is sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.009" end="00:23:19.350" style="s2">of taking an aerial view and looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.499" end="00:23:22.990" style="s2">from you know looking from a high place</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.350" end="00:23:24.970" style="s2">you know what could be a zit and so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.990" end="00:23:27.100" style="s2">but there&#39;s but but both of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.970" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">aspects of wisdom are actually important</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.100" end="00:23:29.830" style="s2">you know what I mean you do have to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.360" end="00:23:31.330" style="s2">looked into the abyss but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.830" end="00:23:34.330" style="s2">time you have to have experienced the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.330" end="00:23:36.850" style="s2">Bliss of the of the you know the eagle</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.330" end="00:23:38.470" style="s2">flying high sort of thing you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.850" end="00:23:43.139" style="s2">I thought that was a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.470" end="00:23:47.019" style="s2">idea of bottom-up and top-down kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.139" end="00:23:48.549" style="s2">wisdom grounded and idealistic or if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.019" end="00:23:50.580" style="s2">like that sort of thing what do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.549" end="00:23:54.059" style="s2">think of that idea do you like that uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.580" end="00:23:56.649" style="s2">yeah another another thought that just</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.059" end="00:23:58.600" style="s2">occurred to me it&#39;s sort of tangential</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.649" end="00:24:00.490" style="s2">but coming back to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.600" end="00:24:03.190" style="s2">alienation just because Peter Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.490" end="00:24:05.350" style="s2">talks about alienation somewhat so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.190" end="00:24:07.929" style="s2">ironic when somebody talks about a topic</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.350" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">like like that but they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.929" end="00:24:13.720" style="s2">realize how integral it is to Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">right so he can&#39;t then take on a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.720" end="00:24:17.950" style="s2">perspective of alienation but but but</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:19.990" style="s2">more specifically about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.950" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">saying like I find it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.990" end="00:24:24.970" style="s2">because I feel like I&#39;ve done both or at</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:25.419" style="s2">least I&#39;ve tried to do both I&#39;ve stared</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.970" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">into the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.419" end="00:24:31.839" style="s2">this and I&#39;ve taken the kind of overview</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:36.789" style="s2">approach kind of looking at big systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.839" end="00:24:38.589" style="s2">and whatever your you&#39;re getting out</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.789" end="00:24:41.649" style="s2">with Eisenstein there like I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.589" end="00:24:43.450" style="s2">appreciate that approach to but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.649" end="00:24:45.579" style="s2">interesting because Peterson stares into</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.450" end="00:24:49.479" style="s2">the abyss and I stared with the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.579" end="00:24:55.019" style="s2">and we see different things Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.479" end="00:24:57.849" style="s2">this very very well-defined kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.019" end="00:25:00.219" style="s2">upbringing like like like everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.849" end="00:25:03.009" style="s2">his bio more or less like he&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.219" end="00:25:05.619" style="s2">northern Alberta he&#39;s like raised like</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.009" end="00:25:09.429" style="s2">kind of conservative religious but also</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.619" end="00:25:12.479" style="s2">had like a socialist streak in in his</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.429" end="00:25:16.899" style="s2">use in his life and then had whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.479" end="00:25:18.399" style="s2">epiphany that that was wrong and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.899" end="00:25:21.219" style="s2">this is another point that&#39;s been kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.399" end="00:25:23.979" style="s2">of challenged or debunked by Nathan</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.219" end="00:25:26.019" style="s2">Robinson bet that Peterson&#39;s reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.979" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">abandoning socialism were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.019" end="00:25:30.759" style="s2">misinformed like he misread Orwell</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:32.859" style="s2">thinking that Orwell was actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.759" end="00:25:37.570" style="s2">against socialism when when in reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.859" end="00:25:43.989" style="s2">Orwell is like critical by at heart a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.570" end="00:25:45.639" style="s2">socialist hmm so this uh yeah this idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.989" end="00:25:47.429" style="s2">of staring into the abyss we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.639" end="00:25:51.009" style="s2">disentangle it from the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.429" end="00:25:53.979" style="s2">judeo-christian worldview that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.009" end="00:25:58.239" style="s2">Peterson thinks is is reality well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.979" end="00:25:59.859" style="s2">like it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a relative</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.239" end="00:26:01.479" style="s2">everywhere right it&#39;s not just it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.859" end="00:26:03.549" style="s2">just it&#39;s not just Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.479" end="00:26:04.989" style="s2">everywhere but I think that&#39;s universe</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.549" end="00:26:06.219" style="s2">Joseph Kennedy as part of the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.989" end="00:26:08.979" style="s2">journey as well isn&#39;t it that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.219" end="00:26:11.379" style="s2">staring into the abyss and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.979" end="00:26:13.149" style="s2">you know in that finding the strength to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.379" end="00:26:17.799" style="s2">then you know to face the dragon but</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.149" end="00:26:19.869" style="s2">yeah sorry I&#39;ve lost stuff completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.799" end="00:26:21.759" style="s2">off so I was gonna say what everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.869" end="00:26:23.649" style="s2">gone well we&#39;re coming up to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.759" end="00:26:25.299" style="s2">half-an-hour remark that&#39;s how the idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.649" end="00:26:27.999" style="s2">cafes are designed to be around half an</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.299" end="00:26:30.219" style="s2">hour so we can have closing statements</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.999" end="00:26:31.989" style="s2">and then go unlive and discuss what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.219" end="00:26:33.609" style="s2">want to do with this recording as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.989" end="00:26:36.369" style="s2">as continue the conversation if we want</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.090" end="00:28:01.260" style="s2">contentious right we&#39;re all clearly very</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.890" end="00:28:03.330" style="s2">much broadly in agreement here right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.260" end="00:28:05.250" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah there&#39;s really not been</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.330" end="00:28:07.049" style="s2">there&#39;s not been that I mean though the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.250" end="00:28:08.549" style="s2">thought which is never it&#39;s obvious when</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.049" end="00:28:12.330" style="s2">you say it but it never occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.549" end="00:28:13.919" style="s2">was the idea that you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.330" end="00:28:15.750" style="s2">easy to say that whatever 30 million</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.919" end="00:28:17.700" style="s2">died in the gulags and 20 million died</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.750" end="00:28:21.870" style="s2">in the Holocaust and whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.700" end="00:28:23.490" style="s2">numbers are but it&#39;s it&#39;s never talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.870" end="00:28:25.530" style="s2">about what is it the step I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.490" end="00:28:27.630" style="s2">sure this is a UN stat it is from a few</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.530" end="00:28:28.679" style="s2">years ago but I&#39;d see no reason to think</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.630" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">it would have changed nationally there</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.679" end="00:28:33.690" style="s2">were a hundred thousand people every</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:36.750" style="s2">single day died in the world right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.690" end="00:28:38.250" style="s2">due to malnutrition and preventable</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.750" end="00:28:39.419" style="s2">disease right so essentially they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.250" end="00:28:41.400" style="s2">dying because they don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.419" end="00:28:43.980" style="s2">money to buy the food and the medicines</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.400" end="00:28:46.890" style="s2">which exist in plentiful supply in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.980" end="00:28:49.169" style="s2">world right and so you know that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.890" end="00:28:51.420" style="s2">source of structural violence for which</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.169" end="00:28:53.430" style="s2">capitalism is directly</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.420" end="00:28:55.320" style="s2">responsible you know that&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.430" end="00:28:58.020" style="s2">thousand people a day what&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.320" end="00:29:00.900" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s 35 million people a year</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.020" end="00:29:02.970" style="s2">you know every single year in year in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:06.150" style="s2">year out factory soil you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.970" end="00:29:08.100" style="s2">mean so yeah and the the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.150" end="00:29:11.100" style="s2">is never talks about that all reckoned</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.100" end="00:29:12.870" style="s2">if you like in the tally of deaths when</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.100" end="00:29:14.550" style="s2">when you look at the two systems versus</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.870" end="00:29:16.260" style="s2">each other I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.550" end="00:29:18.360" style="s2">interesting point as I said obvious when</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">you say it but I never really thought of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.360" end="00:29:21.690" style="s2">it before</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.680" style="s2">mmm-hmm I think about those things all</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.690" end="00:29:24.780" style="s2">the time it&#39;s I&#39;m gonna go back and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.680" end="00:29:26.040" style="s2">watch this and look up some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.780" end="00:29:27.780" style="s2">people you&#39;ve mentioned grunts</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.040" end="00:29:30.600" style="s2">especially the last one because integral</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.780" end="00:29:34.170" style="s2">meets Marxism sounds like my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.600" end="00:29:36.710" style="s2">thing to listen to putting in new</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.170" end="00:29:39.480" style="s2">information I don&#39;t feel the needs like</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.710" end="00:29:41.220" style="s2">go out and learn external knowledge I</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.480" end="00:29:42.570" style="s2">want to look interior like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.220" end="00:29:44.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve done enough of that and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.570" end="00:29:46.140" style="s2">but then the odd time something comes up</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.040" end="00:29:49.410" style="s2">and like yes that that I do want to add</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.140" end="00:29:51.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to continually be looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.410" end="00:29:52.770" style="s2">for new knowledge and not using the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.000" end="00:29:54.030" style="s2">knowledge I have just have an actual</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.770" end="00:29:56.280" style="s2">difference in the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.030" end="00:29:58.800" style="s2">but I also want to be open to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.280" end="00:30:02.190" style="s2">learning new things so I will stop</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.800" end="00:30:04.550" style="s2">recording and then we can go on live by</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.190" end="00:30:04.550" style="s2">YouTube</p>
