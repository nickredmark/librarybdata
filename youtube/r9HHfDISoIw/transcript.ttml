<p begin="00:25:42.670" end="00:25:46.780" style="s2">version of this - you do the complete</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:48.990" style="s2">body scan like I said doing most of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.780" end="00:25:51.430" style="s2">torso and centering it on the dot CN</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.990" end="00:25:52.840" style="s2">really emphasizes the rootedness and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.430" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">said earnest and so that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">want to do the full-body scan there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.640" end="00:26:03.010" style="s2">nothing precluded from doing that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">like I said the problem I find with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.010" end="00:26:08.770" style="s2">full-body scan is it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:11.170" style="s2">really connect very well to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.770" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">centering and routing it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.170" end="00:26:15.700" style="s2">obviously would integrate fairly well</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:17.830" style="s2">with flow but it tends to leave behind</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.700" end="00:26:21.180" style="s2">the centering and routing giving them a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.830" end="00:26:21.180" style="s2">bit of emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.270" end="00:26:27.900" style="s2">and priority really helps to strengthen</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.820" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">the foundations for mindfulness but like</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.900" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">if you can do maybe maybe combine them</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:35.040" style="s2">do the full-body scan and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:38.220" style="s2">especially do the the century and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.040" end="00:26:42.900" style="s2">routing right exercise see let&#39;s see if</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.419" end="00:30:31.869" style="s2">really contextually dependent it will</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.039" end="00:30:33.940" style="s2">depend on events that are happening in</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:39.299" style="s2">confrontations you have so that is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.820" end="00:30:39.299" style="s2">very normal</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.890" end="00:30:45.799" style="s2">good questions here good questions</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.799" end="00:30:49.159" style="s2">the space between the thoughts and how</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.210" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">they merge I started to get images which</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.159" end="00:30:54.169" style="s2">I practically never get even in altered</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:56.600" style="s2">states is it common yes so what can</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.169" end="00:31:01.370" style="s2">often happen as the sort of speaking</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.600" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">part yeah fades away I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.370" end="00:31:05.510" style="s2">choose my bird very carefully there his</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:07.850" style="s2">imagery can take its place</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.510" end="00:31:11.269" style="s2">almost like hypnagogic hypnagogic</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.850" end="00:31:16.669" style="s2">imagery that takes place at that time so</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.269" end="00:31:18.679" style="s2">that&#39;s quite normal and again it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.669" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like you make when you initially</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.679" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">make that space other ways in which your</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:27.049" style="s2">brain you know communicates with itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:29.090" style="s2">and represents its processing to itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.049" end="00:31:31.909" style="s2">can come into the fore in that space</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.090" end="00:31:34.490" style="s2">just treat it like the the speaking</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.909" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">thoughts right notice the space between</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.490" end="00:31:41.149" style="s2">the images etc but if that&#39;s very normal</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.700" style="s2">but some people Walsh reports this and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.149" end="00:31:45.830" style="s2">there&#39;s some evidence to back this up</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.700" end="00:31:49.309" style="s2">that extensive mindfulness practice can</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.830" end="00:31:52.690" style="s2">create synesthesia in individuals so</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.309" end="00:31:52.690" style="s2">yeah quite normal</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.240" end="00:31:59.659" style="s2">so yes most of my distractions are our</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.139" end="00:32:01.340" style="s2">problem of scheduling things that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.659" end="00:32:02.600" style="s2">should be doing during the day and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.340" end="00:32:04.639" style="s2">things which I have to dress in the long</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.600" end="00:32:08.120" style="s2">run should I take cognizance and try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.639" end="00:32:10.580" style="s2">address them in life well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.120" end="00:32:13.570" style="s2">like I said planning and anticipating is</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.580" end="00:32:17.809" style="s2">one of the big things one of big engines</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.570" end="00:32:20.210" style="s2">of your mind and so trying to partially</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.809" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">at least step back from the way that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.210" end="00:32:24.289" style="s2">distracting us at dis identifying with</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">it is good because it opens up a space</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.289" end="00:32:33.740" style="s2">for the kind of thinking that actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:35.240" style="s2">is needed in addition to on try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.740" end="00:32:37.580" style="s2">enhance my words very carefully in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.240" end="00:32:39.980" style="s2">addition to planning which is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.580" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">resilient kind of online coping</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.980" end="00:32:43.399" style="s2">because whenever you&#39;re planning each</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:47.029" style="s2">stage of your plan as you undertake it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.399" end="00:32:49.490" style="s2">actually require requires your you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.029" end="00:32:51.289" style="s2">online coping with that situation it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.490" end="00:32:52.990" style="s2">and your flexibility and your</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.289" end="00:32:55.270" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.990" end="00:32:59.289" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing and so that leads me</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.270" end="00:33:00.820" style="s2">to the point yes I mean you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.289" end="00:33:02.470" style="s2">think you should think of meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.820" end="00:33:04.510" style="s2">something that magically is telling you</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.470" end="00:33:06.490" style="s2">which of your plans you need to schedule</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.510" end="00:33:09.250" style="s2">I think you should do that I think you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.490" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">should like I say do practice the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.250" end="00:33:13.990" style="s2">mindfulness and learning how to pull</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:16.299" style="s2">away from that distraction disidentify</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.990" end="00:33:17.980" style="s2">with it use really good rational</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.299" end="00:33:20.919" style="s2">reflection that&#39;s what that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.980" end="00:33:23.590" style="s2">for within your planning but what you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.919" end="00:33:27.010" style="s2">can do is think about what I just said</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.590" end="00:33:30.039" style="s2">is notice when you&#39;re planning are you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.010" end="00:33:31.659" style="s2">making are you acknowledging that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.039" end="00:33:34.090" style="s2">need to bring mindfulness in this you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.659" end="00:33:37.000" style="s2">need to bring in it pull mental planning</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.090" end="00:33:39.010" style="s2">you need to bring it and cope it so is</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.000" end="00:33:40.840" style="s2">the planning a way of actually sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.010" end="00:33:43.029" style="s2">locking yourself away from something you</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.840" end="00:33:46.270" style="s2">don&#39;t want to see is it away in which</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.029" end="00:33:48.309" style="s2">you are opening yourself up to what</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.270" end="00:33:50.169" style="s2">needs to be done but are you doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.309" end="00:33:52.149" style="s2">mindfully and are you acknowledging and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.169" end="00:33:55.720" style="s2">making space for coping there always</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.149" end="00:33:59.159" style="s2">compliments and is needed for successful</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.720" end="00:34:01.450" style="s2">planning and implementing your plans</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.899" end="00:34:10.440" style="s2">because you are training your brain it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.930" end="00:35:19.300" style="s2">distraction and come out of habitual and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:24.010" style="s2">automatic ways of being so I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.300" end="00:35:25.720" style="s2">that&#39;s important but perhaps what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.010" end="00:35:27.880" style="s2">mean is it takes you quite a while to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.720" end="00:35:29.619" style="s2">have the core four set up and then and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.880" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">only then you feel that you&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.619" end="00:35:36.820" style="s2">go into Metta or Praja that&#39;s fine</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.820" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">but what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.740" end="00:35:46.480" style="s2">slowly reduce the time on the core for</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:48.220" style="s2">right slowly very slowly each time and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.480" end="00:35:49.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of push remember right</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.220" end="00:35:51.940" style="s2">effort you&#39;re always pushing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.780" end="00:35:53.950" style="s2">where you&#39;re having to learn once you</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.940" end="00:35:56.470" style="s2">can do the core for the next thing you</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.950" end="00:35:59.710" style="s2">have to learn is how to do them taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.470" end="00:36:01.930" style="s2">less time less time less time less time</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.710" end="00:36:04.780" style="s2">because you want to move more and more</p>

<p begin="00:36:11.349" end="00:36:13.510" style="s2">alright if right now it&#39;s taking you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.760" end="00:36:15.819" style="s2">thirty minutes</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.510" end="00:36:18.069" style="s2">but because again you have your own</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.819" end="00:36:21.099" style="s2">particular universe in credit history</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.069" end="00:36:23.560" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know of right but once you</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.099" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">have learnt how to find the core for</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.560" end="00:36:29.109" style="s2">then slowly start to reduce the time all</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:34.780" style="s2">right that&#39;s the next thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.109" end="00:36:37.780" style="s2">learning okay hopefully I will help and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.780" end="00:36:39.550" style="s2">yeah when I see when I tried to eat the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.780" end="00:36:41.829" style="s2">pasta I sense my pulse around my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.550" end="00:36:43.869" style="s2">are in my chest should I meditate on as</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.829" end="00:36:44.410" style="s2">a distraction what if that feeling does</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.869" end="00:36:46.599" style="s2">not go away</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.410" end="00:36:47.650" style="s2">you can meditate on the distraction</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.599" end="00:36:48.940" style="s2">you&#39;re not trying to make the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.650" end="00:36:52.260" style="s2">going the way you&#39;re trying to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.940" end="00:36:54.940" style="s2">on how it attracted your attention right</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.260" end="00:36:58.150" style="s2">but what&#39;s happening by the way which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.940" end="00:37:00.670" style="s2">a good thing then is your interoceptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.150" end="00:37:02.290" style="s2">awareness is increasing your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.670" end="00:37:04.329" style="s2">pick up on your own pulse means that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.290" end="00:37:06.490" style="s2">your insula so ability to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.329" end="00:37:09.190" style="s2">your own inner bodily states is</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.490" end="00:37:10.810" style="s2">increasing and that also by the way is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.190" end="00:37:13.030" style="s2">predictive of your ability to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.810" end="00:37:15.130" style="s2">other people&#39;s mental states so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.030" end="00:37:16.420" style="s2">good thing that&#39;s happening I would and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.130" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">again you&#39;re not trying to make the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.420" end="00:37:19.569" style="s2">pulse and go away right you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:21.279" style="s2">get it so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.569" end="00:37:24.699" style="s2">can be off here in the background</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.279" end="00:37:27.160" style="s2">burbling and not taking center stage but</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.699" end="00:37:28.569" style="s2">when it is distracting you and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.160" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">center stage you&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.569" end="00:37:34.509" style="s2">medicate it away you&#39;re just what what</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">was the state of mind like like the five</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.509" end="00:37:40.599" style="s2">factors of mindfulness that brought this</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:42.249" style="s2">centering of it into my mind that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.599" end="00:37:48.670" style="s2">you&#39;re actually applying to five hunters</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.249" end="00:37:50.739" style="s2">of employing mindfulness to Karima do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.670" end="00:37:55.959" style="s2">have to couple the papasa and meta with</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.739" end="00:37:57.789" style="s2">breath it&#39;s a good idea to do so but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.959" end="00:37:59.349" style="s2">mean do you mean within Prasanna or</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.789" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">I mean because meta on its own is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.349" end="00:38:04.680" style="s2">coupled to the breath but passed on and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:08.619" style="s2">Sonja&#39;s but if you mean within Praja</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.680" end="00:38:12.910" style="s2">yeah you do because you you you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.619" end="00:38:15.430" style="s2">keep that roundedness in the living</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.910" end="00:38:17.890" style="s2">movement of your body integrated with</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.430" end="00:38:20.199" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re doing in your mind you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.890" end="00:38:25.269" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get just in your head</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.199" end="00:38:27.039" style="s2">that that can be that can be it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.269" end="00:38:28.569" style="s2">of way in which we get into certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.039" end="00:38:29.709" style="s2">spiritual bullshitting I&#39;m not accusing</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.569" end="00:38:31.509" style="s2">you of this prema</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.709" end="00:38:33.130" style="s2">I&#39;m not what I&#39;m saying because I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.509" end="00:38:35.529" style="s2">noticed this in my own life where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.130" end="00:38:38.859" style="s2">think that to be in our head and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.529" end="00:38:41.619" style="s2">the wonderful spaces in our head is sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.859" end="00:38:44.589" style="s2">of to be spiritual and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.619" end="00:38:46.869" style="s2">danger I think if we uncouple our mind</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.589" end="00:38:49.089" style="s2">motion from our body motion of getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.869" end="00:38:55.150" style="s2">you know to having reminded to be any</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.089" end="00:38:56.859" style="s2">earthly good matthew McCready when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.150" end="00:38:58.569" style="s2">finding our flow and trying to get an</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.859" end="00:39:00.279" style="s2">optimal grip between our focus on our</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.569" end="00:39:02.709" style="s2">stomach area the rest of our torso are</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.279" end="00:39:04.869" style="s2">we trying to make both feelings the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.709" end="00:39:06.219" style="s2">level of detail or a greater detail on</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.869" end="00:39:08.499" style="s2">the stomach area than the peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.219" end="00:39:09.279" style="s2">toast yes exactly exactly once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.499" end="00:39:11.109" style="s2">found the field</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.279" end="00:39:14.109" style="s2">this becomes focal and it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.109" end="00:39:15.699" style="s2">detailed than this which is vaguer in</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.109" end="00:39:17.170" style="s2">the same way that when I&#39;m focusing for</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.699" end="00:39:18.999" style="s2">example right now on the camera it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.170" end="00:39:21.130" style="s2">quite detailed and then this although I</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.999" end="00:39:22.839" style="s2">have an awareness of this it is much</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.130" end="00:39:25.170" style="s2">less detailed because it&#39;s backgrounded</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.839" end="00:39:27.670" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.170" end="00:39:30.339" style="s2">okay I think this will be last question</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.670" end="00:39:33.310" style="s2">for today will take from Alexi siminoff</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.339" end="00:39:36.040" style="s2">any thoughts on adding biofeedback</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.310" end="00:39:38.590" style="s2">like heart math HG bar sensor to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.040" end="00:39:40.920" style="s2">practice um that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.590" end="00:39:45.610" style="s2">there is some evidence its preliminary</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.920" end="00:39:49.090" style="s2">that pairing this practice with</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.610" end="00:39:50.740" style="s2">biofeedback can enhance what hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.090" end="00:39:53.350" style="s2">studied and I have a concern about is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.740" end="00:39:55.660" style="s2">does that transfer to people&#39;s lives or</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.350" end="00:39:56.170" style="s2">does it lock them into having to use the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.660" end="00:39:59.530" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.170" end="00:40:01.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve been something analogous I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.530" end="00:40:02.860" style="s2">recommending it I&#39;m not a medical</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.150" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">professional I was doing it as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.860" end="00:40:06.910" style="s2">researcher where I have paired</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:09.220" style="s2">mindfulness practices with transcranial</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.910" end="00:40:10.270" style="s2">direct current stimulation and I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.220" end="00:40:13.060" style="s2">that there was a powerful synergy</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.270" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">between those two and it&#39;s did seem to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.060" end="00:40:17.350" style="s2">carryover and transferred to my life as</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:19.420" style="s2">a whole I&#39;m not recommending you doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.350" end="00:40:21.910" style="s2">that I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.420" end="00:40:23.590" style="s2">interested scientifically in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.910" end="00:40:25.810" style="s2">possibility that we may be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.590" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">integrate these cyber technologies with</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.810" end="00:40:30.100" style="s2">the psycho technology of mindfulness in</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">a mutually enhancing way so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.100" end="00:40:36.250" style="s2">very interested in that I recommend like</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:37.690" style="s2">that you do a lot more research and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.250" end="00:40:40.810" style="s2">wait for the science to catch up for a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.690" end="00:40:45.460" style="s2">bit before you sort of ad hoc experiment</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.810" end="00:40:48.310" style="s2">on this but you know you you of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.460" end="00:40:49.630" style="s2">are an adult and if you think if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.310" end="00:40:51.730" style="s2">come to a rational and reflective</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.630" end="00:40:53.800" style="s2">decision that it seems safe and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.730" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">appropriate and it doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.800" end="00:40:59.560" style="s2">locking people in then perhaps try it I</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">recommend if you&#39;re going to do it that</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.560" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">you try and do it a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:02.950" style="s2">scientifically keep it journal take</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:07.270" style="s2">notes</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.950" end="00:41:09.160" style="s2">exception so everybody the questions are</p>
