<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:32.000" style="s2">establish for us that there is audio and</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">podcast live stream</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">our 44th am i correct about that number</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">you are correct</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">all right um up front today we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">talk about a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:36.479" style="s2">of caveats and anomalies one</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">is as we will talk more about later in</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">we are facing an incredible inundation</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">of smoke and if you hear us</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">coughing and gagging during the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.919" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">that is what is taking place hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">there won&#39;t be any gagging</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">well all right we&#39;ll try to resist</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">gagging but nonetheless it is uh people</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.319" style="s2">call us now they you know know we live</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">in portland and they ask well what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.319" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">like how are you doing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">the only analogy i have come up with is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">that it is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">like living inside of a bong a bong a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">bong</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">i mean i&#39;ve never lived in a bong no you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">haven&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">in portland it looks like what it must</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">look like from inside of a bong</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.800" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">looking out and frankly just as</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">unpleasant unpleasant and no fun</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">whatsoever so it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">maybe water pipe would be a better way</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">to say it but anyway it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">it&#39;s not very nice out and i will um i</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">will say it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s awfully after so much covet</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.160" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">the um the loophole in covid was of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">outdoors and now going outdoors is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">hazardous to your health and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">i must say i&#39;m feeling more locked down</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">than i have uh maybe ever</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">no abs absolutely it&#39;s even driving the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">animals crazy at this point</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">yep all right the other uh caveat that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">have to mention</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">is you may notice some video glitches</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">during this stream</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">and i raise it because we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">following bizarre situation</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">so we have a little bit of a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">podcast set up here</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">we started noticing glitches on uh on</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">our camera</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">and we went about troubleshooting and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">went through</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">at first we have three cameras that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">identical they all showed the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">glitching we substituted in another</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">camera it showed the glitching</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">we have swapped out the computer every</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">other piece of hardware we have run</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">everything off of batteries to see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">it is not our wall power causing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">problem it happens when we are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">connected to the internet</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">so in short we have eliminated every</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">possible cause of the glitching we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">falsified</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">every hypothesis save one</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">may i mention uh one of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">interventions uran&#39;s saks interventions</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">or should i not</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">no you may yeah you you literally built</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">tin foil hats for the cameras</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">we did wrap the cameras in tin foil so</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">this is the problem is the one remaining</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">that could possibly explain the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">glitching of all of our cameras and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">are now by the way this is our fifth</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">camera that you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">you are seeing through at the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">it is also glitching though slightly</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">less than the others</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">um the only hypothesis left standing is</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">interference from something external</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">now oddly which could be thwarted by</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">uh aluminum foil could be and in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">saw some effect</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">if we put the aluminum foil but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">complete we can&#39;t protect any of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">cameras completely by wrapping them in</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">foil at least by any technique that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">have used</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">now if we take the cameras out of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">room they stop doing it</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">so i don&#39;t say they start functioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">again they start functioning normally</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">and we can&#39;t reproduce the problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know what to make of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">right it it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">certainly um triggers my tinfoil</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">hat side because you falsify every</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">and what are you left with is you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">either so it&#39;s at least convenient that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">it triggers it both literally and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">metaphorically so that you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">keep track of the two narratives</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">right well exactly it&#39;s very it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">narratively convenient in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">uh in its own way in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">conspiracy theorizing rarely is but</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">exactly um yeah so i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">know what to make of this maybe somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">out there in our audience will have i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">searching for the answer that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:14.079" style="s2">the smoke or the fires</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">you know in some ways the smoke</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.079" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">interrupting cell signals so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">turned up the amplitude on them in order</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">to compensate in a way that might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">intruding</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">but frankly we&#39;re not all that close to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">a cell tower</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">you know and why would the problems uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">not persist when you just moved the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">cameras</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">to another two rooms over or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">right so um this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a head scratcher but anyway if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">see color bars show up</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">uh we are aware of the problem um but</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">having falsified every hypothesis we</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">we got nothing yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">all right so we&#39;re gonna talk about fire</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">and sex today</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">fire and sex yeah but not at the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">time not but in that order</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">yes all right i believe so fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">uh so many many people will know</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">that we are in portland oregon and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">portland oregon uh is experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">as all of oregon in fact all of the west</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">coast is experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">uh extraordinary wildfire situations um</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">portland itself does not have any active</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">evacuation orders although um the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">evacuation orders are</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">are close um to to most people in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">portland at this point including us</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">and apparently the air quality in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:27.360" style="s2">city right now is the worst in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">and has been for about 48 hours and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">certainly feels that way when you walk</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">outside of course i&#39;ve never been to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">delhi or beijing or um you know but i it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s far worse than what i remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">los angeles being like in the 70s when</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">we grew up when the sky was</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">reliably yellow with smog right with</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">particulate matter that was suspended</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">in the air and uh this is this is far</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">far far worse so um i thought we&#39;d talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">a bit about what fire is what humans</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">history with fire is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">uh including on the west coast and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">elsewhere um</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">and you know what what might be causing</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">these fires and what the effects might</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">so uh at first i i feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">defending portland against this uh claim</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">that it has the worst</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">air quality on earth and i must say i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">a little skeptical of this because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">not even sure that what we&#39;ve got here</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">qualifies as air at this point</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">i think it&#39;s too solid right yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s air in the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">way that styrofoam is air</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">that&#39;s an extraordinary defense well</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s the best i could come up with</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">yeah um so let&#39;s just start uh with</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">just a paragraph from the draft of uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">the book that we&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">um which in which we talk about fire a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">um in service of talking about the human</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">innovation that is cooking specifically</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">um fire is is um early and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">critical in every human evolution story</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">over a million and a half years ago our</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">ancestors were already controlling fire</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">fire brings many advantages of course it</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">provides warmth and light</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">a warning of protection against</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">dangerous animals and a beacon to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">a little later on in our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">with controlled fire we began to use it</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">to boil water and make it potable</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">to eradicate pests to dry our clothes to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">temper metal with which to make tools</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">with fire we can see each other and our</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">work at night and we may gather around</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">it telling stories or making music</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">there are no known human cultures</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">without fire although early reports from</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">anthropologists missionaries and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">explorers often made claims to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">contrary</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">none other than darwin suggests that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:31.519" style="s2">art of making fire was quote</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">probably the greatest discovery</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.519" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">accepting language ever made by men</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">so um that that goes into our deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">um i thought we might also</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">why is this not working it&#39;s fun um zach</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">can you show</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">this um my screen here</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">um and so this is this is a figure from</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">a book</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">called isle of fire the political</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">madagascar by christian call</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">so regular viewers and listeners will</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">know that i did my</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">graduate research in madagascar and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">brett and i both spent a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">time there i&#39;ve actually written a book</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">about my</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">experiences there and this is a book</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">proved useful though not directly</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">relevant obviously to my exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">the sex lives of poison frags which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">more of what i was focused on but</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">madagascar being the fourth largest</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:23.199" style="s2">island in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">bigger than california off the east</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.199" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">coast of africa</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">and there is a long history of the use</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">of fire</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">both for landscape modification and for</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">protest</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">by people among most of the 13 or 14</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:42.880" style="s2">tribes of madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">so this this book</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.880" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">early on discusses some of the causes or</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">goals of fire</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">um and some of the effects and because</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">many of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">are relevant in discussion of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">happening in the american west right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">i thought i&#39;d go through just a couple</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">of these of course there are um</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">non-human causes like lightning and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">other sources</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">and then a whole lot of of things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">you might do</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">um here human-caused purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">uh on on this figure that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">constructive</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">sweden or</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">often called slash and burn which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">actually an effective mode</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">of agriculture at low population</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">densities but it becomes ineffective at</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">high population densities and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">we will talk about here i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">management of pests and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">and cleaning up of detritus all of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">understood to be constructive purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">um reasons to set fires and of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">there are destructive reasons as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">and in this figure christian call says</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">revenge or personal gain</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:16:00.639" style="s2">right so the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">odd sociopath or psychopath or um simply</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.639" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">very angry person or protest and of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">course it can be hard sometimes to tell</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">the difference between those two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">and then finally just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">categories um human-caused accidental</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">fires</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">exist where a campfire gets away from</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">you cigarette butts get thrown out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">windows</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">somebody&#39;s gender is a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">explosive than one imagines</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">is foreign strategy on here uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">in other words denying your enemy a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">resource or corralling your enemy to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">some place where you have an advantage</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">my guess is that that&#39;s gonna fit under</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:38.959" style="s2">under control constructive um you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">so so depending on how you view it you</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.959" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">know what side of the interaction you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">on you might view is destructive</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">and therefore it&#39;s revenge or personal</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">gain or you know statewide gain</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">um or um other under constructive so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">know successful</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">military strategy yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">and uh you know maybe maybe maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">enough to start uh for those of you just</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">uh just listening to this we have not</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">described the full</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">the full figure but um</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">but definitely some of it so um</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot to say but i</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">think probably um beginning a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">conversation as opposed to me just</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">you know going on and on about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">various things that are true</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">about fire throughout human history but</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">maybe maybe one more thing first before</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">we start talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">um fire has been a feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">american west for as long as we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">records</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">uh which given that we can go back uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">and look at pollen cores from you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">several hundred thousand years um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">a long time</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">um also the west is not just one place</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">there are at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">four distinct regions uh the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">northwest where we are now</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">um the uh the coastal west</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">farther south the inland</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">west and then the inland southwest</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">really have different</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">different species compositions different</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">fire regimes different seasonality with</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">regard to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">when it&#39;s dry when it&#39;s not how cold it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">gets how hot it gets all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">but at least several</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">several good pieces of research and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly several a lot of bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">research as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">but significantly significant amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">good research</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">find for instance that at least since</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">1400</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">bad fire years have been consistently</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">associated with summer drought</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">the drought years and this you know this</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">seems obvious when you say it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">actually by looking at um basically fire</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">scars and trees from a database across</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">350 sites in the american west</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">they find that fires are reliably</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:41.679" style="s2">predicted</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">by drought earlier in the summer um not</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.679" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">as reliably predicted by temperature</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">in some parts of the west that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">but unless actually the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">northwest</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">um and uh that there have of course been</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">mega droughts in the american west</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">before we are probably in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">one now</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">or or getting into one um this</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">this one appears to be the worst in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:04.720" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:07.679" style="s2">since uh well i don&#39;t have it written</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.720" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">down maybe since the 1500s i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.679" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">and most of the models uh that i</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">see and you know whenever we say models</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">i want to put an asterisk there and say</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">okay this is this is a model</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">this we have now um gone outside the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">realm of the directly</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">measurable um suggests that 30 to 50</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">of the explanation for increasing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">drought is due to climate change</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">and so that&#39;s not 100 that&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">close to 100 but there is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">an explanatory component here of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">increasing fires in the american west</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">um that has to do with increasing number</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">of droughts and the droughts seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">um have a 30 to 50 percent roughly</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">um explanation due to climate</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">anthropogenic climate change</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">so uh there are about a dozen things in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">there i want to respond to of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">one is interesting that it is summer</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">drought and not winter drought</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">um that is predictive it could be either</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">and so the fact that one of these is</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">um is contributing more strongly is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">and there it&#39;s more complicated right</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">that there is some stuff around snow</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">reduced snowpack</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">in the california in california not so</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">much up here in the pacific northwest</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">but in california reduced snowpack which</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">is going to be about winter drought</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">uh can increase the risk of of summer</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">fires of summer and fall fires</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">right and so um you know some</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">effect on agriculture for example is</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">typically going to be about winter</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">drought</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">because it&#39;s about snowpack which fill</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:28.799" style="s2">refills</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">uh aquifers and reservoirs and things</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.799" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">like that which is a very different</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:33.840" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">than we&#39;re talking about here um so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.840" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">so drought isn&#39;t one thing it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">two things and um they will both have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">contributory um capacity so just to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">clear you&#39;re saying the two things in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">this case and i think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">are just um the seasonality of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">drought right winter drought versus</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">summer job right you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">having a you know a normal summer</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">and a dry winter and that would affect</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">agriculture but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">might not affect fires etc so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s that i also wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">just point out this story i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">where you&#39;re going but i have a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">that this story is one that is just</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">going to be haunted throughout by</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">um equilibria and their disruption</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">and so i wanted to say you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">that sweden agriculture the burning</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">of an area which most people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">familiar with as slash and burn slash</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">and burn agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">is very effective at low density</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">why now it&#39;s effective at low density</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">fire takes nutrients that are stored in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">above ground plant matter and it returns</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">some of them to the soil as ash</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">and it liberates some of them into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">atmosphere where they no longer</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">contribute to the growing of plants so</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">you can grow crops there with the burst</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">of nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">that you release with the fire but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">less than the biomass that once stood</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">so effectively in a tropical situation</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">where you don&#39;t have a big</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">buildup of resources you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">right exactly which is why low</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">population density is a limiting</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">factor on that one and i mean and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:05.039" style="s2">additional additional reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">sweden works at low population densities</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.039" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">is that um</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">it&#39;s going to work only at low at low</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">spatial scale</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">because a fire that&#39;s out of control</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s going to release almost all of its</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">nutrients into the atmosphere which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing here right now and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">it&#39;s you know making it very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">breathe for a lot of people and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:23.600" style="s2">other organisms as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">whereas a low slow burn allows that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.600" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">the mold ring to go back into into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">ground basically and so what you end up</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">with in these sweden plots</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">are they&#39;re small they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">surrounded on at least three sides by</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:35.200" style="s2">intact forest</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">uh which means that they can then be</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.200" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">repopulated once you grow on them for</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">four six</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">eight years until you&#39;ve used the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">nutrients that you&#39;d released from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">slow</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">low burn and then you let the forest</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">grow back in at which point you know you</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">cycle through and if you come back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">that original plot 20 years from now</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">but that means that you&#39;ve got i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">making up numbers here but you know 19</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">out of 20 of your plots in any given</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">are not actively under agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">intensive agricultural regime</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s crop rotation on a very different</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">time scale and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">um you know before you ever label it as</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">um one more thing that you mentioned um</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">that won&#39;t be obvious to most people is</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">unlike in for instance the central</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">valley of california or</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">um the great plains and um sort of upper</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">midwest</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">of um of the united states like iowa and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">um that are that are that have been such</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">rich fertile croplands</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">uh where the the nutrients really do</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:35.280" style="s2">live in the soil</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">in the lowland wet tropics the nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">live in the biomass</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">excuse me not in the soil and so what</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:43.679" style="s2">you&#39;re doing what you have to basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">clue just such a system if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.679" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">to do agriculture in these very poor</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">tropical soils</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">to get the nutrients that are above</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">ground into the soil right so actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">it takes a fair amount of sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">the forest that grows back after you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:58.799" style="s2">have done sweden agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">in the tropics is not the same forest so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.799" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">this is another one of these lessons is</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">that you&#39;re actively</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">taking over the management of an</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">ecosystem and so even things that look</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">like virgin forests like the amazon it</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">turns out</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">are tremendously affected by you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:13.840" style="s2">many thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">of intensive agriculture the evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.840" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">which has mostly been buried so</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:18.400" style="s2">at first people didn&#39;t you know the west</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">did not understand that it had taken</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.400" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">place at all</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">right and that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">part of this story that you know where</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">where is wild nature you know to to what</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">degree does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">and and we as people who desire to spend</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">as much time</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">in as untrammeled nature as possible we</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">have to recognize that actually almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">everywhere on the planet at this point</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">has been managed by humans</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">at some point to some degree and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">harder and harder to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">the greater population density gets yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s this i mean i guess we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">get back to it but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">naivete at the point that you you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">at the point that europeans show up in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">the new world and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">you know for one thing many of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">populations that were in the new world</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">that is the americas when europeans</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">showed up were hunter-gatherers not all</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">there were large civilizations here but</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">nonetheless hunter-gatherer populations</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">are less troubled</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">by the burning of a particular piece of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">habitat because they&#39;re not as wedded to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">right so at the point that you you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">take a settlement</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">approach then you view fire as an enemy</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">and you your temptation is to suppress</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">it but the problem is this interrupts a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">different equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">right yes which i don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">wanna you probably have</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">a lot to say on the subject but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">equilibrium in question</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">is the accumulation of fuel so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">tendency as more and more fuel that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">dead wood and other above ground dead</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">biomass</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">is accumulating there&#39;s a higher risk</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">that any given spark like from lightning</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">will trigger a fire and then the point</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">is the amount of fuel</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">goes to a very low level an unusually</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">low level at which point fire becomes</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">much less likely to happen again</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">and so anyway there&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">equilibrium that is chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">but nonetheless maintained by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">that there&#39;s a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">ignition from things like lightning and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">a tendency to burn off the fuel</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">and so as soon as a and a single</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">giant fire in most of the american west</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">that happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">as a result of those things are we still</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">live zach</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">okay yep um</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">it&#39;s apparently a single large fire is</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">recovered from</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">relatively quickly um from uh the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">plant and animal and fungus perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">uh and and bacteria and everything but</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">two or three in rapid succession and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">harder for the ecosystems be they forest</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">savannah or prairie or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">some of which of course were created by</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">human management in the past</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">um it&#39;s harder for them to grow back in</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">part because</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.279" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">a second fire coming rapidly on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">heels of a first</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">say one or two years later has all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">that now fallen wood</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">to burn so just like we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">about with regard to sweden agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.440" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">you know successful</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">slash and burn agriculture leaves a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.320" style="s2">of sort of coal</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">sitting on the surface that can be dug</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.320" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">in right so the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">the of the wood that is partially burned</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">that is that is sitting on the surface</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">the next fire comes through well that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">fire is going to catch more</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">quickly and burn hotter and destroy even</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">some of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">plants that actually need fire to for</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">instance set seed in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">so you have two things that work this</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">way you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">um the positive feedback that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">the initial fire freeing up more</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">fuel basically rendering wood more</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">likely to burn</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">and the other thing is that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">accumulation of the fuel in the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">place that comes from intensive fire</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">suppression</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">results in much higher f hotter fires in</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">the first place yes and because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">fires are</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">hotter in the first place they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">kill things that otherwise are adapted</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:59.279" style="s2">to withstand them so</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">you know things like sequoias are so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.279" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">long-lasting that of course they have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">live through fires and you&#39;ll see the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">evidence that a given tree</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">you know has been burned multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">and it survives its part and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">you know the uh the germination of seeds</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">of many species actually require fire so</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:17.520" style="s2">at the point that you naively think fire</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">bad and you start suppressing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">you&#39;re setting in motion the things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">make fire much rarer and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">much worse exactly and um</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">you know there&#39;s i mean there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">places to go here fire is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">you know one of the biggest topics that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">that we could talk about right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">you know one of the things we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">this problem up here in the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">northwest but in california</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:39.679" style="s2">eucalyptus has been introduced from</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.679" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">and of course is you know thrives with</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">fire and so when</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">fires happen with eucalyptus around</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">those fires tend to get extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">hot</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.120" style="s2">and almost the only organism who wins in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">that situation is the eucalyptus itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.120" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">so um what you what you just said though</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">uh reminds me of this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">hypothesis that was first proposed in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">1991</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">that is loosely framed as pyrodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">increases biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">and that was from a paper that i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">get access to it was conference</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">proceedings but a more recent paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">bowman at all 2016</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">summarizes the argument uh this way let</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">me just let me just share this here</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">uh this is a 2016 summary of martin and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:25.919" style="s2">sapsis&#39;s 1991</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">uh versus looking at some of these more</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">heterogeneous techniques</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">that were used um in earlier times and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">it does seem that pyro diversity does</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">increase biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">but can it be done</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">in a modern and 21st century environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">where there are economic forces that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">different and population density</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">is higher and people have different</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">considerations about what it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to maximize well um first</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">of all i mean it seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">almost certain that this hypothesis will</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">turn out to be true i will i&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">stickler and i will say i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s fair to say you can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">experiment a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear to me in the case that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">um you don&#39;t know the answer that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">can&#39;t effectively</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">say well you can test it but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not doing an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">that&#39;s my distinction you&#39;re fine if</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be a semantic sticklers</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">that&#39;s my distinction i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">stickle right back because</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">my point would be actually you can run</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">the experiment you can say as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">which of these fire suppression regimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">is uh better for us</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">it actually is moral to deploy them in</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">such a way that we can at least detect</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">the difference</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">um so i think it is fair to do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">one has to do it responsibly but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">other thing is in the case that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">can&#39;t do it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">declared immoral right let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">some fire suppression</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">regime is clearly inferior then it would</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.880" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">immoral to deploy it over any large</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.679" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">landscape but</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">then you have the natural experiment of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">where it was done before people knew so</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">the reason i&#39;m stickling is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">an experiment but it&#39;s what we call a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">natural experiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">like the galapagos is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">experiment rather than an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">laboratory or field and that wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">an excuse to tell me you were sticking</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:54.080" style="s2">no and only the biologists in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">audience are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.080" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">understand that stickling back is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.519" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">basically it&#39;s like a declaration of war</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a declaration of fish at least it</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very fishy declaration</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:05.519" style="s2">of war</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">um all right so sorry now what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.519" end="00:33:09.360" style="s2">train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">um let&#39;s see well let me let me say a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.360" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">couple more things and i&#39;ll bet you find</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">your train of thought again</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">um so some of the errors that we find in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">thinking and you know i would say on</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">sort of both sides of the political</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">aisles</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">some some of these errors are on one</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">side some on the other um</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">more on the on the right side of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">political aisle we see</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">imaginings that the environment can just</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:32.240" style="s2">be controlled it can be mastered</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">that all we have to do is figure out</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.240" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">what needs to be done and control mother</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">nature and be done with it</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">and this imagines that the environment</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">is static about over both</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">time and space um and that strategies</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">that will work at small scale will also</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">work at large scale</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:48.799" style="s2">and you know all of all of the issues uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">that were mentioned in this original</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.799" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">martin and sepsis paper</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">that small and large are the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">frequent and infrequent fires will act</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">the same way</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">that uh decrease in the heterogeneity of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">seasonality will act the same way as</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">having fires in both seasons</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">and severity won&#39;t change anything so</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">so you cannot you can cannot just come</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">in with a heavy hand</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">as a bunch of humans and control nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">um that said the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">sort of the naive error in thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">tends to be more likely to come from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">is that if we just leave nature alone it</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:23.599" style="s2">will heal itself and become its original</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.599" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">and the the reason that this is um i</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">think this is a less egregious error</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">but precisely because of what you raised</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">just a few minutes ago that actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">truly wild land left and we would you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">know i</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">i would like more land set aside for</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">national park</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">you know rather than national forest</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">like i would i would i would</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">like more of this land that actually can</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">be left to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">to do what it&#39;s going to do but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">that um either uh the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">the earth itself will find an</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">equilibrium that suits our temperaments</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">or that the people who lived here before</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">before us we&#39;re doing something that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">inherently peaceful and lovely and would</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">work at scale</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">um are both pretty naive so i would uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">introduce two concepts here one is</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">the the idea of walking into a complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">and managing it from the get-go as if</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">you understand what the forces are</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">um in play is folly to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:28.320" style="s2">and so it&#39;s the hubris of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">century really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.320" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the hubris of those who have</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">learned well the lessons of simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">systems and then attempt to apply them</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">to complex systems and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">the fact that complex systems are uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.520" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">relatively</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">newly well studied means that we are now</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">beginning to understand what we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">doing wrong but in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">it was chester chesterton&#39;s fence all</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">along and at the point that you walk</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">into a system that you know to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.599" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">what you know is that your simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">interventions are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">cascading effects that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">right and we should have seen this</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:04.480" style="s2">coming all along</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">so anyway one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.480" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">instead of trying to return things to a</p>

<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">not messing them up in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">is a way better deal</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">right so it&#39;s tough though because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">pretty much messed them up at this point</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">we have and the problem the problem is i</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">mean a when you tell people</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">there are no wildlands truly wild lands</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:28.960" style="s2">have the sense that what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.599" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">is it&#39;s lost</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.960" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">rather than let me tell you a story the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">amazon as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">is not natural right there was an amazon</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">there is an amazon they&#39;re two different</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">forests they&#39;ve been radically altered</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">by</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">like the amazon</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">is not a fascinating and wild place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">just not</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">in its original state and we can also</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:55.920" style="s2">say you know because because you and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">have been lucky enough to be traveling</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">to lowland tropical rainforests for</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">decades at this point and only to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">amazon since</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:05.320" style="s2">2013 i guess i was there briefly in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">brazilian amazon in</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.320" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">2003 but um</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve been going to the same place a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">couple of times since 2013</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">and even since then um the last time we</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">were there was earlier this year</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">which we&#39;ve noticed noted before is</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">impossible to imagine but we were there</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">in january of 2020 and the first time we</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">were there was in june of 2013.</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">and the amazon that we saw in june of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">2013</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">was it&#39;s you know this glorious jungle</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">wild seeming incredibly biodiverse in</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">fact it&#39;s understood this particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">spot in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">ecuador and amazon is understood to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">the most biodiverse spot on earth</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">and a mere seven years later we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.760" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">already seeing um a decline in</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">and you know we we imagine um that</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">three of the three of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">are happening is an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">oil drilling and an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">the insecticides that are traveling down</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">river and killing off the insects which</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">are then affecting the insectivorous</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:07.920" style="s2">birds which are then affecting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">organisms that eat the insecticides</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:12.560" style="s2">and again to return to this the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">widespread fires that have been allowed</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.560" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">to flourish in the brazilian amazon</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">especially since bolsonaro took office</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">um which are in part the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">development that he&#39;s encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">and you know basically once you build a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">road um the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">the wildness of a place is going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">quickly um decline</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">and you get this phenomenon which</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">quite a lot of wildlife in in yasuni</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">where we go but there&#39;s an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">forest</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">on the way to that most diverse place on</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">and the really terrifying thing is how</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">you can deplete a piece of forest of its</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">animals or at least its large animals</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">um and so you know to a casual observer</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">it looks like oh there&#39;s so much forest</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">and the point is no no some of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">forest</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">you know you could walk for quite a long</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">way and not encounter</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">any um large animal life no vertebrates</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">to speak of or not many anyway it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">some common birds but</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">not much else and the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">especially people armed with modern</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">can deplete a piece of habitat very</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:24.320" style="s2">quickly and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">this this thing that tropical biologists</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">know but have a hard time compelling</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">others of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">is that the road is the death knell</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">right if you think well we&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">to put you know it&#39;s one strip of forest</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.839" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">like relax</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s one you know it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">how many meters wide is a road it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">that big a deal it&#39;s like no no</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve just given access to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">expert hunters who now</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">have access to modern tools to all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">this forest that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">uh very difficult to access before and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">it just it empties them</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s stunning in part i mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">far afield from talking about fire</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">directly here but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">the what what was obvious to us in</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">tipputini in</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">in yasuni uh just eight months ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">um is true there even though there is no</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">road there</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">like the last um few hours of approach</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">um to to get there it&#39;s an all-day trip</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">is by river in fact you know you go you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">go over the andes from quito to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">to coca and you get on the rio napo for</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">for a while</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">and then uh you get on a dirt road um in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">a truck</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">um that was built by the oil companies</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">uh for a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">and then the road ends and you get back</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">on to now the rio de patini</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">uh both of which are you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">tippatini&#39;s a tributary of the napo and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">opposed the tributary of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:38.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s directly to retire of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">amazon if i remember correctly</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">um but so there is no road where we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">where where we go and yet um</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">and yet it is happening there too it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">happening there too and it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">you know for one thing this is a field</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">station so there&#39;s lots of longitudinal</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">data about</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">various clades longitudinal meaning time</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">so we know that bird populations are</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">radically decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">we know that bat populations are</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">radically decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">um the one that i didn&#39;t see coming was</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">in between our</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">this most recent trip and the one before</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">cayman had been very common on the river</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">such that if you went you know even a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">little ways on the river at night with a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">headlamp you you would see cayman</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">we didn&#39;t see a single cayman no clue</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">how that&#39;s connected to anything else</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">why caiman populations</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">would have dropped it could they used to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">line the banks in some in some places it</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t you had like the cayman areas and</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">the turtle areas and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">and they were just always a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">turtles as well</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">um yeah there were many fewer turtles so</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">you know what is it is it um that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">insect population has crashed</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.520" style="s2">and that this indirectly came and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">eat insects but they</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.520" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">do eat fish and many of those fish</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">survive on insects that have fallen into</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">the water or</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">things like this so who knows what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">connection is if you want to see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">reverse of this so basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">complex system however came and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">connected to whatever is changing in</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">remote piece of habitat who knows the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:05.440" style="s2">reverse story is told</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">by the wolves that were reintroduced to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.440" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">yellowstone</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s beautiful work showing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">radical cascade of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">effects where the reintroduction of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">wolves adjusts the um</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">the deer population right the deer are</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">no longer free</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">to forage wherever they want which</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">creates an increase in the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:28.319" style="s2">plants anyway you get this cascading</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">beautiful effect from the reintroduction</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">of this you know top carnivore</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">um so anyway it&#39;s all complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">and basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">stop messing with them and magic happens</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:39.839" style="s2">and you start messing with them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">you can&#39;t keep up with the symptoms it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.839" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s like a body that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">you know you&#39;re giving them a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">pharmaceutical for something and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">you&#39;re treating the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">side effects and the side effects and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">eventually that&#39;s right the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:52.110" style="s2">falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.110" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">you and i both grew up in la and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">experienced fires there</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">and in fact we&#39;ve we also saw um i was</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">about what are our other experiences</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">with fires um</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">certainly in the last two decades the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">american west has been experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">worse and more frequent fires i remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">actually on our honeymoon</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">in turkey driving west from cappadocia</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">coming across a wildland fire that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">appeared to have been intentionally set</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">and it was on bo</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">it was it was in a grassland that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">low and it was on both sides of the road</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:29.839" style="s2">and it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">safe enough we weren&#39;t this stupid it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.839" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">seemed safe enough that we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">the car that we had rented and took</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">pictures of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.520" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">and sort of stood there watching this</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">meandering line beautiful fire</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">move across this landscape it was near</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">sunset as well so the colors were</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">extraordinary it felt less apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">than what&#39;s going on outside our windows</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">um and i don&#39;t you know we never talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">to anyone about there was no one around</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">to talk to about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.560" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">um but it it certainly i think and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">not sure even we talked about it but i</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">immediately we both viewed this as this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">looks to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">this looks like no one&#39;s worried about</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">it this looks intentional this looks</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">like management and there was nothing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">was going to reach there weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:10.160" style="s2">structures or a forest that it was going</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">to get loose in it would be grassland</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.160" end="00:44:12.880" style="s2">burning and you know grasslands after</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">fires</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.880" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">our new growth is prompted and so for</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">people for</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">um pastoralists who have um animals that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">graze</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">intentional setting of fires does</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">release does does prompt new growth of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:26.160" style="s2">grass and so your animals get more food</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">and it might you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s um potentially regular</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">burning acro</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">in many many places in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">basically in the fall to fatten up your</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">to to prompt new growth of grass to</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">fatten up your animals so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:44.079" style="s2">make it through the long winter</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">so what though um</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.079" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">if if climate change um explains</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.160" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">something significant but probably less</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:54.560" style="s2">than half</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">of the increase in in fires</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">uh in the american west we also have</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">this suppressive fire management</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">uh which has not allowed which has been</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">at best and simply suppressive at worst</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">um we have drought um</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">that to some degree is just going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">happen so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">there&#39;s natural cycles of of drought and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">it may just be our</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">time right uh and what else</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">we have sprawl which is putting people</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">in direct</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">contact with lands that might otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.359" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">uh burn and you know burn themselves out</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">with some regularity</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">we care more about every single fire um</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:39.119" style="s2">i hesitate to even say it but we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.119" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">people who have lost the plot and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">are no longer in on the agreement</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">that once um we all held that it was bad</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">when um things</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">burned right when you know that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">say that every fire is bad but</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">there are people who are setting</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">destructive fires</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">um with their own purposes whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">to make the news</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">or uh something else but</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">the fact is that&#39;s right um fire</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">is a force multiplier</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">right so terrorists trade</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">in fear an organization of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">size can create a much bigger effect if</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">they can scare you into hurting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:27.839" style="s2">fire is not exactly that it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">fear it&#39;s actually destructive but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.839" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">one idiot can do an</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">awful lot of damage they can control an</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">resource by</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:41.280" style="s2">triggering these things and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.280" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">there&#39;s really not a whole lot we can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">to stop it you wouldn&#39;t want to live in</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">the dystopia</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">in which everything was so well</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">monitored but you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">yeah so you you called them people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:54.839" style="s2">have lost the plot</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:57.760" style="s2">what i&#39;ve written here is intentional</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.839" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">provocateurs</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">thing to be engaging in now and there</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">you know as as the fires have um have</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">become worse and worse over the last</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.839" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">several weeks</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">there has been uh increasingly as you</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:35.599" style="s2">would expect</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">you know the mainstream media is now</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.599" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">saying anyone who talks about arson</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">as a cause of any of these fires is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">clearly um</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">you know on the right and um doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">have their their finger on the pulse of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">and you know i would say once again um</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">the idea that with so much data still</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">out with so much of the story still</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">unknown the idea that it is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">that any of these fires were set by</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:04.319" style="s2">um and therefore if you say that any of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">them were or might have been set by</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.319" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">arson</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">you are making a political point is</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">itself a political point and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to listen to you well and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">actually at this point we know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">that some of them are set by us and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">what the political leanings of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">people were or we can imagine at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.119" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">whether it was a mat or</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:22.720" style="s2">it was political at all but we there was</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">good strong evidence at this point</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">that some not most but some of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">fires</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">were set by humans um with um</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">with purposes that were not in anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">best interests</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">yeah and it you know the fact is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">had tons of arson</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">here in portland in the last 100 some</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">odd days</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">yeah right now it hasn&#39;t been wildfires</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">um it is perfectly it is a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">legitimate question</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">we have ample evidence that there has</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">been arson involved some of the fires</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:53.599" style="s2">that were started by arson were then put</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">out by citizens</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.599" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">immediately so you know what the nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">of any of this was we don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:01.920" style="s2">um but nonetheless we have to look</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">ourselves in the eye and say a couple</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.920" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">one you cannot play this stupid game</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:08.720" style="s2">where you tell certain people that</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">whatever they do in the name of some</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:11.920" style="s2">cause that we agree in the abstract is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">good one</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:15.359" style="s2">is legitimate right you cannot set a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">fire</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.359" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">against racism a that doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:21.520" style="s2">freaking sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">and b um it&#39;s going to become an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.520" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">for everybody who&#39;s looking i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">what&#39;s really happened is we&#39;ve got it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">the same era though as racism is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the same error it&#39;s using the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">metaphor it&#39;s using the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.800" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">actually going on in the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">and applying that as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">to the current social justice issue and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">sometimes it works and sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t but it&#39;s never literal</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:44.559" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s never literal you can&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">did you mean that phrase was amazing</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.559" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">what did you just say you can&#39;t set a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">fire</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">against racism it wasn&#39;t quite what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:51.839" style="s2">said no</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:53.440" style="s2">it was close something like that and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.839" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">know and no systemic racism is not a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">and you can&#39;t set a fire against racism</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">that we&#39;re saying racism isn&#39;t real but</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:04.319" style="s2">you know yeah you guys have seriously</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">lost the plot if that&#39;s what you think</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.319" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">is the right way to deal with this well</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">or the rest of us have freaking lost the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:12.960" style="s2">plot because what we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:16.240" style="s2">is long standing tiny</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.960" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">or anarchist fringe that has of late</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">glommed on to a nominally anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">movement right and the point is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">actually driving this</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">anarchism and what does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">anarchism</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">right right go figure you know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">been telling us that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">they wanted anarchy and they&#39;ve told us</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">why and it doesn&#39;t add up but the point</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">we now have municipal authorities making</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">excuses for these people</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:41.760" style="s2">that is going to increase their</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.760" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">committing all kinds of crimes because</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">they&#39;ve effectively been told i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">know all of the people who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">uh released after committing crimes and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:53.920" style="s2">being arrested for them and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:54.800" style="s2">you know the tools that was collected to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.920" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">get them released</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:50:59.599" style="s2">right um you know we had ted wheeler</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">announcing this week that he&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.599" end="00:51:03.359" style="s2">uh gonna allow the use of tear gas to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">dispel these riots</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.359" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">yeah he snuck that in right as the fires</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">were getting real close to portland uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">kind of like an eleventh hour</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">uh thing that no one was going to notice</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">yep yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">it&#39;s preposterous so i don&#39;t know are we</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">more to do but i think i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">probably good for uh for one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:26.640" style="s2">still need to talk about sex</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">this film</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">uh i you know i i got it made it made a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">lot of sense of course that would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">awful and there&#39;s a scene early on in</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">under a bed because she was doing</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:54.000" style="s2">eavesdropping but she&#39;s eavesdropping on</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.000" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">which i think is the auntie is telling</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">the mom you need to call all the family</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">members and tell them how pleased you</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">and uh after the auntie leaves the mom</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:12.559" style="s2">breaks down and is crying and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly an awful situation and um</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.559" end="00:53:16.240" style="s2">you know situations in which polygeny is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">forced on women are</p>

<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:25.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s awful however</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">however uh the idea that this</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.800" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">hyper-sexualized pre-teen</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">dance again in quotes behavior by by</p>

<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:38.240" style="s2">is an antidote uh is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:39.599" style="s2">we are led to believe now maybe part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.240" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">the point they were trying to make in</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.599" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">the film</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">but but no there is so much graphic</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">sexualization of these little girls in</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">this film</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">uh that uh that could have been done</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">differently without actually bringing</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">bringing all of our attention to their</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.559" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">and the fact is that the opposite of</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">is not female female hypersexualization</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">both of these things both of these ways</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">of being are deeply disempowering of</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">so um i&#39;m not sure that wasn&#39;t the point</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">the screenplay</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:21.359" style="s2">i i found the wit the that um pointing</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">out that this</p>

<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">level point and the point i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:47.440" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:49.970" style="s2">was that the um</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.440" end="00:54:51.839" style="s2">obvious problem with uh</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">problem and it is this</p>

<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">of girls um and so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">actually i i detested this film okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">it was both um tedious</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">and disgusting at the same time right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">um to the extent that it you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:37.119" style="s2">like the moment-to-moment plot was like</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">a you know it was like lord of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.119" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">butterflies like a girl version of lord</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">of the flies</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">you know actually and that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to interrupt for long but</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">we also saw this group of four girls</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:51.200" style="s2">sometimes five but sort of oscillating</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">group of four girls</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.200" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">behaving like a gang of errant boys</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">except that they were using their</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">budding sexuality to get what they</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:00.000" style="s2">needed</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">but they were being aggressive and uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.000" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">and you know they were act they were</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">they were play acting as boys and as</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">women and in fact they&#39;re neither</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">they&#39;re girls</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">right so anyway the film</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:15.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t any good but the very final scene</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">suggested to me that it was not making</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.280" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">the point that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:19.640" style="s2">thought it was making which was that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.640" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">hypersexualization is the antidote to</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">the other thing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">very final scene seems to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">it was making a point more like the one</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">that i was trying to make in australia</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">which is that both of these answers are</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">absurd</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">and that that&#39;s a problem right that</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.000" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">basically these are girls and they</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">should be allowed to be girls rather</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">than be</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">turned into to women early and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">very final scene is like</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">15 seconds it&#39;s 15 seconds long more</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:45.599" style="s2">than an hour and a half</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:47.599" style="s2">i was surprised to see it because i was</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">already writing my scathing review in in</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.599" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">my head and then it was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">actually maybe they do have the right</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">point now the film is still despicable</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s still despicable because it</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">was actually filmed with</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">underage girls which meant that it</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:01.839" style="s2">couldn&#39;t avoid</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">doing the very thing that maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.839" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">right and somebody made some decisions</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">in the making of this film</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">to sexualize these girls in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">would probably increase audience because</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">it will</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:16.240" style="s2">appeal to a certain fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">presumably straight</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.240" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">men which is despicable so the point</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">that tulsi gabbard made on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">yesterday that had her trending</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.520" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">about the fact that this is likely to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">increase things like trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:30.319" style="s2">is surely right and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:32.799" style="s2">ultimate uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.319" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">evil here which is what netflix has done</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.799" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">right so the point is netflix clearly in</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:39.520" style="s2">the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">are attempting to attract people is not</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.520" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">in possession of</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">what this actually was which is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">very questionable art film right right</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:50.319" style="s2">what netflix decided to do was turn it</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">into a sensation</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.319" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">either because of the sexualizing of</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">young girls or because of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">controversy that would arise out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:58.799" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">either way my god right we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.799" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">going to tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:05.839" style="s2">netflix doing this but</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">the whole thing is sort of tangled</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.839" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:10.960" style="s2">i you know i don&#39;t know whether i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:14.319" style="s2">know what was on the mind of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.960" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">the screenwriters if it had been</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.319" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">um a book in which there were no</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:19.839" style="s2">actresses</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:21.599" style="s2">and it made the same point that i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.839" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">it was making in that very final scene</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.599" end="00:58:24.799" style="s2">then i would say</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:26.480" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an important point right by</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.799" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">doing it in this way</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">that um for the entirety of the film</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:34.079" style="s2">seems to be suggesting that you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">this is liberation</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.079" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">um totally pollutes that message and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:41.760" style="s2">then for it to be co-opted by</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:43.359" style="s2">a an economic goliath with its own</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.760" end="00:58:46.960" style="s2">bottom line in mind</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:49.760" style="s2">um is is truly troubling yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.960" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s not i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.760" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">excuse for any of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">um explicit visual sexualization of of</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">the children</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:59.119" style="s2">in the film um but it&#39;s not even just</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">one scene it&#39;s throughout</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.119" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">it you know it starts early and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">to the penultimate scene basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">and uh it is it&#39;s excruciating</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s at some level more of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">uh that uh that you know hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">and madison avenue etc have been giving</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:19.760" style="s2">us for</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">decades and decades and decades except</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.760" end="00:59:23.359" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:27.200" style="s2">age range about which it&#39;s acceptable is</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.359" end="00:59:30.559" style="s2">advancing earlier and earlier and like</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.200" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">if what what kind of a country imagines</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.559" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">that sexualizing children is okay i i</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:36.720" style="s2">can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:38.880" style="s2">imagine what&#39;s in your head if you think</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.720" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">that that&#39;s okay like you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.880" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">again you know really lost the plot on</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:45.359" style="s2">what childhood</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">is and should be and can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.359" end="00:59:52.319" style="s2">and must be i totally agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:56.079" style="s2">and i as i was watching</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.319" end="00:59:59.119" style="s2">um this film um</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">i did have the following odd thought</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.119" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">which was suppose there had been no</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.119" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">controversy</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">right suppose that somehow we had</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:08.480" style="s2">encountered this thing and thought okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">french art film</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.480" end="01:00:12.400" style="s2">you know senegalese immigrants and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">watched it without any</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.400" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">um without any uh context expectations</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:20.319" style="s2">of what it was i am sure that i would</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">have found it despicable</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.319" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">but i am not sure that i would have</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">found it noteworthy</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:27.359" style="s2">in other words this is part and parcel</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">of what we do to girls and the thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.359" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">that was extreme here was</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">how young the girls were but the fact</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:35.839" style="s2">that we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">constantly being bombarded with messages</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.839" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">that um hyper-sexualized girls that play</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">games with actresses who may be you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">adults but are playing younger right</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">this whole thing is just how the west</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">functions and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:54.839" style="s2">to me i think it&#39;s almost entirely the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">result of madison avenue</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.839" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">using female sexuality this very potent</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">force to sell [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.520" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">right and that in that the fact that it</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">has affected the way women view</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">themselves as almost a byproduct</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">of the desire to raise people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:09.839" style="s2">insecurities in order to get them to buy</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.839" end="01:01:15.280" style="s2">but i i don&#39;t think i would have</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">thought maybe i would have thought to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.280" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">tweet my god did i see a terrible film</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">let me tell you what&#39;s in it but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:23.359" style="s2">sure that</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">it would have you know would have stood</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.359" end="01:01:25.680" style="s2">out i i</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">bet there&#39;s a good chance we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.680" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">have finished watching it oh absent the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">context right it would just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">start and i&#39;m like what are they doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">wow no never mind right just just just</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">not watching this</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:38.160" style="s2">um i guess i want to just reiterate what</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">i think i said earlier but maybe didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.160" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">say clearly which is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:45.880" style="s2">this is this is being sold to us</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">as a response to the disempowerment and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.880" end="01:01:50.880" style="s2">desexualization</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.440" end="01:01:51.599" style="s2">of the women in this senegalese</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.880" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">immigrant</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.599" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">muslim uh community and</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:01:59.200" style="s2">there is then this conflation of sex</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.280" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">with power and this you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.200" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">very much in the you know critical</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">theories um</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:07.599" style="s2">genre of thinking through post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:11.359" style="s2">and post-structuralism and such</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.599" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">um sex obviously is used as power as we</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.359" end="01:02:14.400" style="s2">were just talking about by madison</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">avenue by young women bought you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.400" end="01:02:18.720" style="s2">in a lot and a lot of places but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.720" end="01:02:23.520" style="s2">observing that a</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">family structure community structure</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">routinely and frankly systemically</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">disempowers women</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:32.079" style="s2">and that probably that</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">disempowering of women is about</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.079" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">controlling of sex</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">does not mean that the response to that</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">ought to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">all sex all the time as early as</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">possible um</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:45.359" style="s2">absent any any community interaction</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">or commitment or anything because that</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.359" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">is also not going to empower anyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:50.640" style="s2">you are not you are you are not going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">simply</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.640" end="01:02:56.000" style="s2">have power if you flaunt sexuality at</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">every at every turn</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.000" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">um just because you have observed</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:00.319" style="s2">correctly um that women in your</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:02.960" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.319" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">um are decentralized and also have no</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.960" end="01:03:06.640" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">yeah two things uh one of these points i</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.640" end="01:03:11.440" style="s2">think is</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:11.440" style="s2">is going to be very hard to make but</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.599" end="01:03:17.599" style="s2">the control that society</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.359" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">almost inevitably exerts over female</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.599" end="01:03:23.039" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.799" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">is not about controlling females per se</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.039" end="01:03:26.559" style="s2">it&#39;s about society right and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.559" end="01:03:30.079" style="s2">point i tried to make in australia is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:32.960" style="s2">that in fact there is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.079" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">when human beings are living in high</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.960" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">density</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">which has to do with the effect that</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">sexuality um</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:40.559" style="s2">the disruptive effect that it has if</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.039" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">there&#39;s not some</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.559" end="01:03:46.799" style="s2">mechanism that keep some kind of order</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:49.520" style="s2">and the point i made in australia was</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.799" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">there are many different mechanisms some</p>

<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">are laughable some of them are</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">ghastly all of them the unfairness of</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">all of them falls too heavily on women</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:03.039" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:05.280" style="s2">it is society figuring out mechanisms to</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.039" end="01:04:09.359" style="s2">address an actual structural problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.280" end="01:04:12.400" style="s2">that um that results in</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">in this and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.400" end="01:04:16.480" style="s2">at some level the upshot is we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">have a good solution here we&#39;ve got lots</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:20.960" style="s2">of bad solutions</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:24.079" style="s2">but this is the inevitable result</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.960" end="01:04:27.440" style="s2">you know of society in which um</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.079" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">you know it is perfectly natural for uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.440" end="01:04:32.559" style="s2">cardi b to be talking to joe biden in</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">the midst of a presidential election</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.559" end="01:04:37.280" style="s2">as if we you know why are we shocked</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:39.200" style="s2">as if that&#39;s also getting this</p>

<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:47.039" style="s2">message there</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s applauding hypersexualization and</p>

<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">of women by women and this is another</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">difficult point to make but the point is</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:59.760" style="s2">actually you know what</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.559" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">female sexual power is power</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.760" end="01:05:03.680" style="s2">but females are in competition with</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:06.000" style="s2">themselves in a sense because</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.680" end="01:05:07.039" style="s2">which power do you want to drive the</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.000" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">world do you want</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.039" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">female achievement to be the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">female power that women should aspire to</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:16.240" style="s2">or do you want their ability</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:16.960" style="s2">to tangle society in knots which of</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.240" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.960" end="01:05:21.760" style="s2">fades so no and i think this is um this</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:23.359" style="s2">is in fact the key tension between sort</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.760" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">of second wave feminism and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.359" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">later waves feminism that second wave</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:30.880" style="s2">feminism was</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:34.240" style="s2">aspiring to free women from many of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.880" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">domestic shackles that you know some of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.240" end="01:05:37.440" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">are simply biologically enforced by</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.440" end="01:05:39.599" style="s2">anatomy and physiology by the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.799" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">women are who</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.599" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">gestate and lactate but</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">freeing women from the from the inherent</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:49.359" style="s2">expectation that you know you will have</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:51.119" style="s2">you will be married and have children</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.359" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">early and you will be the ones</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:54.000" style="s2">you will be the one staying home and</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:55.920" style="s2">taking care of them it&#39;s sort of a solo</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.000" end="01:05:56.880" style="s2">parenting role which itself is a novel</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.920" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">thing right you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.880" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">in monogamy that tends to be by parental</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">um not the sort of 1950s housewife</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">version of</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:08.559" style="s2">of family life which is a very weird</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:10.000" style="s2">little blip that i don&#39;t know why anyone</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.559" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">aspires to that</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.000" end="01:06:14.160" style="s2">but so second wave feminism was about</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.240" end="01:06:15.839" style="s2">freeing women from constraints that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.160" end="01:06:18.160" style="s2">could be freed from</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.839" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">and presumably allowing us to make</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.160" end="01:06:21.280" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">based on what it was that we wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.280" end="01:06:25.440" style="s2">do in the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">achievement and you know observing</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.440" end="01:06:28.640" style="s2">that men and women are different and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:30.160" style="s2">that women will sometimes make the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:32.079" style="s2">choices as men and sometimes different</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.160" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">ones and those choices may actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.079" end="01:06:36.079" style="s2">help society become a better place as</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">well and let&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.079" end="01:06:39.440" style="s2">embrace the kinds of contributions that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:40.960" style="s2">women can make in the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.440" end="01:06:42.799" style="s2">that all feels to me like the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.960" end="01:06:44.799" style="s2">second wave feminism that my</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">mother and her business partner and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.799" end="01:06:48.079" style="s2">women who i had as role models when i</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">was growing up</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.079" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">engaged with and then we have this third</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:53.920" style="s2">way feminism come around</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:55.280" style="s2">which is about using the power that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.920" end="01:06:58.400" style="s2">have as your sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.280" end="01:06:59.920" style="s2">to trick men into doing stuff and to</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.400" end="01:07:01.599" style="s2">you know pretend that that means that</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.920" end="01:07:02.559" style="s2">you&#39;re in power and you&#39;re not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.599" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.559" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">a it&#39;s it will end you know actual</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2">achievement</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:10.319" style="s2">will grow over time just like male</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:12.880" style="s2">actual achievement grows over time</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.319" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">why would you pick the model of power</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.880" end="01:07:16.400" style="s2">that is brief</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:17.520" style="s2">that is fleeting uh and that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">disempowering</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.520" end="01:07:20.799" style="s2">well because you suddenly come into it</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:23.599" style="s2">when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:24.559" style="s2">15 16 17 11 apparently if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.599" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">cuties</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.559" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">and um it&#39;s it&#39;s surprising it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:32.079" style="s2">shocking</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">and uh you know every young woman has to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.079" end="01:07:35.039" style="s2">figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">how to deal with it but imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.039" end="01:07:38.559" style="s2">that&#39;s the pinnacle of your life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">like being the dude on the football team</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.559" end="01:07:41.680" style="s2">at 17</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:43.440" style="s2">who&#39;s that&#39;s his best moment in life</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that is the equivalent</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.440" end="01:07:48.559" style="s2">of um aspiring to be you know only a</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">sexual being and that that is what your</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.559" end="01:07:51.200" style="s2">value is as a woman</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s you know it has always struck</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.200" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">me as anti-feminist</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">faux feminist and of course it goes by</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:57.280" style="s2">third wave feminism and doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:07:59.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.280" end="01:08:02.559" style="s2">anything anything empowering of women</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.680" end="01:08:05.920" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s an inversion of feminism</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.559" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">the thing that i would add is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.920" end="01:08:11.680" style="s2">it is also largely arbitrary you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">like melanin content of your skin right</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.680" end="01:08:14.559" style="s2">why do we want people judged by the</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">content of their character rather than</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.559" end="01:08:17.759" style="s2">the color of their skin</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.000" end="01:08:19.920" style="s2">because it makes for a better world</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.759" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">right if if we do that and so the point</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.920" end="01:08:21.920" style="s2">is it&#39;s an immutable characteristic is</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:23.920" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.920" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">it may i don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.920" end="01:08:27.279" style="s2">immutable it may be that you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">a beautiful woman is in part beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.279" end="01:08:29.839" style="s2">because or a beautiful young woman is</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:33.040" style="s2">beautiful because</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.839" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">you know she uh puts effort into</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.040" end="01:08:37.040" style="s2">being fit or whatever but um but it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:39.440" style="s2">largely</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.040" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">immutable and so there the question is</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.440" end="01:08:43.359" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">you know we could take a traditional</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.359" end="01:08:46.480" style="s2">view and you know women are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">playing the supportive role</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.480" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">at home many of us don&#39;t want that right</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:53.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t want that but we also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:54.000" style="s2">want a anything that empowers women is</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.000" end="01:08:57.520" style="s2">because of what&#39;s empowering you is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:08:58.159" style="s2">you&#39;re waving your tits in somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.520" end="01:09:00.159" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.159" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t produce it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.159" end="01:09:03.520" style="s2">productive right i don&#39;t want that any</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">more than anything that empowers men is</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.520" end="01:09:05.920" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:07.040" style="s2">anything that empowers pick your</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.920" end="01:09:09.199" style="s2">demographic</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.040" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">is good is a terrible rubric and will be</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.199" end="01:09:11.440" style="s2">gamed and we see that in black lives</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:13.520" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.440" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">we see that in me too we see that in</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.520" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">cuties we see it across the board of</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:19.920" style="s2">course we do</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:20.719" style="s2">right and so what you want is a system</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.920" end="01:09:24.880" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.719" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">um the women who are empowered to speak</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.880" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">for example to presidential candidates</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:31.279" style="s2">and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.199" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">are women who have accomplished</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.279" end="01:09:35.440" style="s2">something that has</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:36.799" style="s2">brought you know that&#39;s made the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.440" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">more interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.799" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">uh has extended our capacity in some way</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:43.440" style="s2">right has contributed right the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">mythology of markets</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.440" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">is that you get paid for contributing to</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:51.120" style="s2">our welfare by creating things</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:52.400" style="s2">that enhance us and the problem is if we</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.120" end="01:09:55.679" style="s2">put too much emphasis</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.400" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">on uh youthful sexuality in females</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:09:59.360" style="s2">which you know there&#39;s a biological bias</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:01.520" style="s2">in favor of exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.360" end="01:10:03.120" style="s2">then what the point is the females who</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.520" end="01:10:05.920" style="s2">end up empowered</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.120" end="01:10:06.560" style="s2">are inherently going to be young and</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.920" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">that means</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">the chances that they will actually know</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:11.679" style="s2">something worth conveying</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.080" end="01:10:13.520" style="s2">are that much lower right youth and</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:14.000" style="s2">wisdom are inversely correlated almost</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.520" end="01:10:15.760" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.000" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">right and you can be wise beyond your</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.760" end="01:10:19.120" style="s2">years but you you know you can&#39;t be wise</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:22.480" style="s2">as a very young person</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.120" end="01:10:24.000" style="s2">yeah and so anyway it&#39;s really you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.480" end="01:10:25.760" style="s2">these two kinds of feminism are in</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.000" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">competition with each other and when you</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:28.719" style="s2">spot</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">the direction one of them pulls it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.719" end="01:10:35.280" style="s2">absolutely anti-feminist</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:35.280" style="s2">yep that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">you wanted to say some things about</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.719" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">unity before we uh before we stopped i</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:43.280" style="s2">um yeah just a little bit of an update</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:44.640" style="s2">we are uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.280" end="01:10:46.800" style="s2">you know at a kind of an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.640" end="01:10:49.199" style="s2">moment with unity twitter has of course</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.800" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">said nothing yet about why it is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.199" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s suspended our account it has</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:56.320" style="s2">ignored the appeal that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:59.120" style="s2">filed and it&#39;s just now gone silent and</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.320" end="01:11:01.040" style="s2">um increasingly i think the only</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">explanation for this behavior</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.040" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">is political we found no evidence of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.440" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">things that we were rumored to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">uh when eric talked to jack uh and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">you know the things that were spread</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:14.719" style="s2">online we are not russian bots we did</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:15.679" style="s2">not register large numbers of accounts</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.719" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">in order to</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.679" end="01:11:21.679" style="s2">trend a hashtag um so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">at some level i think we are discovering</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:25.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:26.719" style="s2">that you know twitter is not the ghost</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.760" end="01:11:28.880" style="s2">in the machine</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.719" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">the ghost is the machine it has its</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.880" end="01:11:32.880" style="s2">thumb on the scales</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:34.000" style="s2">it is adjusting the way democracy works</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.880" end="01:11:35.920" style="s2">it is deciding</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.000" end="01:11:37.679" style="s2">what a legitimate political perspective</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.920" end="01:11:39.520" style="s2">is and what it isn&#39;t and it favors the</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.679" end="01:11:40.320" style="s2">duopoly which is not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.520" end="01:11:42.480" style="s2">because of course it has</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.320" end="01:11:44.480" style="s2">disproportionate influence over how we</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.480" end="01:11:46.719" style="s2">are to be governed through that duopoly</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.480" end="01:11:48.320" style="s2">so what the hell are we going to do i</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.719" end="01:11:51.920" style="s2">mean this is this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.320" end="01:11:53.600" style="s2">um an impossibly dangerous force and</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.920" end="01:11:55.120" style="s2">what i fear is that it is going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.600" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">prevent any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.120" end="01:11:59.280" style="s2">change that is not seen by the duopoly</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:00.960" style="s2">as in its interest</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.280" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">and that that change has become</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.960" end="01:12:04.400" style="s2">increasingly essential and on a short</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:07.440" style="s2">time scale</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.400" end="01:12:08.719" style="s2">so that is uh roughly where we find</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.440" end="01:12:11.440" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.719" end="01:12:13.760" style="s2">we are still forging ahead i am hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.440" end="01:12:15.600" style="s2">um we have begun to interact with</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.760" end="01:12:18.239" style="s2">joe jorgensen i&#39;m hoping she will come</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.600" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">on our campfire and talk to us about the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.239" end="01:12:20.880" style="s2">possible partnership between</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">libertarians</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.880" end="01:12:24.480" style="s2">and the unity movement she is skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:29.840" style="s2">um i believe when she sees uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:31.520" style="s2">what our perspective really is that she</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.840" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">might well um</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.520" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">be willing to partner</p>
