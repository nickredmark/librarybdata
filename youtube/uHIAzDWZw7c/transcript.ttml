<p begin="00:00:00.979" end="00:00:06.420" style="s2">good morning and we&#39;re live which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.319" end="00:00:08.220" style="s2">what my brother says every live video</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.420" end="00:00:13.230" style="s2">starts with and it&#39;s not very enticing</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.220" end="00:00:14.519" style="s2">and this is hope for a solution raisins</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.230" end="00:00:17.869" style="s2">today it&#39;s just Eric and I and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.519" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">talking about energy we&#39;ve both seen the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.869" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">produced by Michael Moore documentary</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">with Jeff Gibbs</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">something planet of humans which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:27.330" style="s2">sure will end up coming up and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">woman since it came up in last one that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.330" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">was just the medic connection this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">actually about energy so would you like</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.890" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">to start Eric on what what the current</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:40.260" style="s2">shitshow of energy looks like I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">things work today yeah I mean it is as</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.260" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">you said a show I mean it really is</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.600" end="00:00:48.710" style="s2">I mean our reliance on fossil fuels is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:51.480" style="s2">wholly unnecessary right I mean if if</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.710" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">alternative technologies particularly</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.480" end="00:00:55.110" style="s2">storage technologies I mean it&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">onto this I&#39;m sure later on but</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.110" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">particularly storage technologies had</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">been pursued more earnestly from earlier</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">on but you know the necessity to double</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">down on oil I mean I estimates vary but</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:13.280" style="s2">somewhere around the 1960s 1970s there</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">was an opportunity for us as a global</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.280" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">industrialized civilization to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">reducing our dependence on a resource</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:23.490" style="s2">which we knew at some point sooner or</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">later was gonna run out right I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.490" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">you can argue about how long it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">going to take but the inevitability of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">it&#39;s running out at some point you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:36.509" style="s2">is unquestionable and so the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:39.750" style="s2">building an entire societal</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">infrastructure on a resource which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.750" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">gonna run out you know what I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2"> insane and I see so for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">reason you know beyond anything else for</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">that reason yeah it&#39;s a complete</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:53.579" style="s2">show so yeah how do we dig ourselves out</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">of this show well I mean assuming</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.579" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">that it&#39;s even possible to do so now at</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">this late stage it&#39;s gotta come on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">multitude of France right on the one</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:04.890" style="s2">hand we&#39;ve got to at an individual and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:07.729" style="s2">at an industrial and the societal level</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.890" end="00:02:10.050" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to reduce our energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.729" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">consumption until such time as we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">produce enough to increase our</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:15.090" style="s2">consumption without it impacting at</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:16.470" style="s2">see on the biosphere right when we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.090" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">do that then great we can start using</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.470" end="00:02:19.380" style="s2">more but in the meantime we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:21.000" style="s2">shoulder a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.380" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2">responsibility right and voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.000" end="00:02:25.640" style="s2">just start using less energy in all in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:28.740" style="s2">in in all kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.640" end="00:02:32.270" style="s2">number two is yeah obviously trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.740" end="00:02:36.210" style="s2">generate it in less impactful ways but</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.270" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">based on that documentary you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.210" end="00:02:41.160" style="s2">referred to it&#39;s not as easy to do there</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:42.990" style="s2">and we come back to storage right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.160" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">the big the big problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.990" end="00:02:46.050" style="s2">documentary highlights we&#39;ll the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">problem in apart from the general</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.050" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">capture of the green lobby book but on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">practical level the biggest problem it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">highlights it was that things like wind</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">and solar are great right they do</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:01.800" style="s2">generate power but you still have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:03.330" style="s2">have gas and coal fire stations running</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:04.680" style="s2">alongside them because when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.330" end="00:03:06.390" style="s2">generating plainly something else to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.680" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">take over and so the inability to store</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.390" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">the excess when they&#39;re producing excess</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:13.160" style="s2">and use it at times when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:16.020" style="s2">producing enough that&#39;s a huge block and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.160" end="00:03:18.600" style="s2">battery storage technology the patents</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.020" end="00:03:20.580" style="s2">for battery technology are all owned by</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:22.320" style="s2">Panasonic and Samsung or whatever I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.580" end="00:03:23.670" style="s2">even Elon Musk II does not make his own</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.320" end="00:03:25.470" style="s2">batteries most people think he&#39;ll I must</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.670" end="00:03:27.900" style="s2">make batteries he doesn&#39;t make batteries</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.470" end="00:03:29.400" style="s2">he makes battery management technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.900" end="00:03:31.489" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what his patents are</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.400" end="00:03:33.480" style="s2">his battery management systems he buys</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.489" end="00:03:35.100" style="s2">millions and millions and millions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:36.450" style="s2">double A batteries essentially from</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.100" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">Panasonic and sticks them together in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.450" end="00:03:40.320" style="s2">large packs and that that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:44.489" style="s2">that&#39;s where he gets his batteries from</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.320" end="00:03:46.890" style="s2">so the relinquishing of the patents on</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.489" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2">battery technology so that everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.890" end="00:03:50.220" style="s2">their garage can just start pissing</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.180" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">about with batteries without having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.220" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">whole range of possibilities excluded</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">from them because of the patents of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:58.680" style="s2">hell that&#39;s the biggest single blockage</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:01.980" style="s2">to renewables is storage technology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.680" end="00:04:03.930" style="s2">it&#39;s stuck because obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.980" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">existing companies have no interest in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.930" end="00:04:07.019" style="s2">allowing the marketplace to develop</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.670" end="00:04:09.420" style="s2">things which are undercut their market</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.019" end="00:04:10.890" style="s2">share and the oil companies have no</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.420" end="00:04:12.630" style="s2">interesting storage technology being</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.890" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">developed which would make oil obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.630" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">and so we&#39;re we&#39;re stuck in this no</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:23.090" style="s2">enough for me I&#39;ve got five minutes I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:25.980" style="s2">used over four that&#39;s enough I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.090" end="00:04:27.660" style="s2">especially the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.980" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">the fact that we are so reliance on</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.660" end="00:04:34.260" style="s2">fossil fuels and wherever green energy</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">is it&#39;s not there yet and so green area</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.260" end="00:04:38.040" style="s2">has to be green energy has to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">become more efficient and have</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.040" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">innovation while not mass producing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">quite yet because it&#39;s not yet efficient</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t you don&#39;t get more energy out</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">of it than you put into it which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:49.950" style="s2">make any sense but producing them in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:51.300" style="s2">smaller quantity or both getting into</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.950" end="00:04:54.390" style="s2">the next topic instead of this one</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.300" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">currently we have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.390" end="00:04:58.500" style="s2">let go of our reliance on fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:04:59.970" style="s2">both in energy and all the other things</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.500" end="00:05:04.110" style="s2">that come from the petroleum byproducts</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.970" end="00:05:05.580" style="s2">and our current renewable energy doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.110" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">quite get us there because it&#39;s entrance</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.580" end="00:05:09.390" style="s2">and then of course the patent system</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">that whenever anyone comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.390" end="00:05:13.260" style="s2">something that is innovative someone can</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:14.670" style="s2">buy it and put it on the Shelf that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:16.350" style="s2">patent system keeps people from</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.670" end="00:05:18.150" style="s2">innovating that you can own it how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.350" end="00:05:20.280" style="s2">you own a battery patents this many</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.150" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">years in like batteries didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.280" end="00:05:25.410" style="s2">come up with batteries a decade ago this</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">should be long now release the patents</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.410" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">of I do think there are energies out</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.620" style="s2">there so this is one of those things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:35.540" style="s2">not supposed to talk about and yet I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.620" end="00:05:39.750" style="s2">don&#39;t look at that world anymore</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.540" end="00:05:42.690" style="s2">complete full transparency my family</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.750" end="00:05:46.140" style="s2">invested in this company over a decade</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.690" end="00:05:48.270" style="s2">ago that at the time was very close to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:50.940" style="s2">coming up with muon catalyzed fusion and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.270" end="00:05:54.510" style="s2">now has come up with it almost over a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.940" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">decade ago but and this is where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.510" end="00:05:58.230" style="s2">either the world&#39;s worst Ponzi scheme</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.230" end="00:06:01.980" style="s2">they kind of have these understandable</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:03.960" style="s2">investment things but they&#39;re like oh we</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.980" end="00:06:06.360" style="s2">need to create this whole processing</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.960" end="00:06:09.750" style="s2">plant into a we need to convert it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.360" end="00:06:11.700" style="s2">out of Australia and it&#39;s all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.750" end="00:06:13.410" style="s2">the possibility it&#39;s just BS right this</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.700" end="00:06:16.590" style="s2">never happened it&#39;s just a Ponzi scheme</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.410" end="00:06:18.540" style="s2">but if it&#39;s in any way real the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.590" end="00:06:20.130" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t exist in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.540" end="00:06:22.200" style="s2">now the fact that these people have this</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.130" end="00:06:24.300" style="s2">hard of a time getting the word out</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.200" end="00:06:26.580" style="s2">there the fact that they&#39;ve had people</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.300" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">come and look at it from America that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.580" end="00:06:30.390" style="s2">like there&#39;s all these weird regulations</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:31.860" style="s2">in the background of like if you come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.390" end="00:06:33.870" style="s2">with a new source of energy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.860" end="00:06:36.450" style="s2">really a new source of energy not wind</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.870" end="00:06:38.580" style="s2">and solar but something like neon</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.450" end="00:06:39.750" style="s2">catalyzed fusion that you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.580" end="00:06:41.370" style="s2">sell it to one person you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:43.110" style="s2">have to sell it to multiple countries at</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.370" end="00:06:44.700" style="s2">the same time which makes sense you</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.110" end="00:06:47.940" style="s2">don&#39;t want a new monopoly but like in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.700" end="00:06:49.530" style="s2">this you have people who of course their</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.940" end="00:06:53.040" style="s2">entire fortresses on coal processing</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.530" end="00:06:55.200" style="s2">plant supposedly this technology you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.040" end="00:06:57.420" style="s2">retrofit coal processing plants you turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.200" end="00:06:59.790" style="s2">ocean water into energy and then you do</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.420" end="00:07:02.870" style="s2">have very plentiful I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.790" end="00:07:05.130" style="s2">the storage but if you&#39;re turning um</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.870" end="00:07:06.390" style="s2">ocean water into energy you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.130" end="00:07:07.950" style="s2">the storage right it&#39;s not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.390" end="00:07:10.020" style="s2">waiting for waves you&#39;re actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.950" end="00:07:12.060" style="s2">the deutronium out of the water and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.020" end="00:07:13.830" style="s2">again I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s like I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.060" end="00:07:16.020" style="s2">it&#39;s true that&#39;s why we invested in it</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.830" end="00:07:18.180" style="s2">and all this time ten years later but</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.020" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like the politics and the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.180" end="00:07:22.350" style="s2">information they&#39;re like well we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:23.970" style="s2">people to be positive about fusion when</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.350" end="00:07:26.790" style="s2">they&#39;re not about fission because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.970" end="00:07:28.740" style="s2">not dangerous there isn&#39;t that but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.790" end="00:07:30.570" style="s2">fact that nobody knows about it the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:32.310" style="s2">that it&#39;s not out there the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.570" end="00:07:33.780" style="s2">really need energy I&#39;m like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.310" end="00:07:35.580" style="s2"> care if I get trillions of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.780" end="00:07:37.890" style="s2">dollars out of this our planet needs</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.580" end="00:07:40.440" style="s2">clean energy so why isn&#39;t this happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.890" end="00:07:42.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s where I&#39;m like as an investor</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.440" end="00:07:43.860" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to not talk about it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.120" end="00:07:45.479" style="s2">I don&#39;t care anymore like I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.860" end="00:07:47.490" style="s2">get legends like it&#39;s either real or</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.479" end="00:07:50.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not and if it&#39;s real it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.490" end="00:07:52.020" style="s2">out there our investment be damned and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.220" end="00:07:54.600" style="s2">if it&#39;s not real but you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.020" end="00:07:57.630" style="s2">clearly that comes too late in it is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.600" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">kind of thing but it&#39;s like I think and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.630" end="00:08:01.200" style="s2">whether or not that&#39;s true I do think</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.400" end="00:08:02.820" style="s2">things like that exists people come up</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.200" end="00:08:04.979" style="s2">with technology and then it falls by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.820" end="00:08:07.229" style="s2">wayside see their song buys a patent and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.979" end="00:08:08.610" style="s2">it sits on the shelf or even if you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.229" end="00:08:10.380" style="s2">it to be out in the world even if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.610" end="00:08:11.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t sell it to to one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.380" end="00:08:12.419" style="s2">companies just for them to sit on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.880" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">shelf</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.419" end="00:08:15.780" style="s2">you&#39;re still existing in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.850" style="s2">marketplace how do you get the word out</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.780" end="00:08:20.580" style="s2">how you get people to say okay is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.850" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">safe is it effective yet are we creating</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.580" end="00:08:23.610" style="s2">an energy that&#39;s not like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:24.690" style="s2">taking energy off the grid and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.610" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">pretending we&#39;re making it</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.690" end="00:08:28.710" style="s2">this isn&#39;t connected to anything is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.940" style="s2">producing energy is it also producing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.710" end="00:08:31.979" style="s2">radiation you know do you mean like how</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.940" end="00:08:33.539" style="s2">do you actually test it and then have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.979" end="00:08:36.289" style="s2">way for it to be tested where you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.539" end="00:08:38.610" style="s2">stealing it right you&#39;re not gonna gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.289" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">reverse manufacture it but considering</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.610" end="00:08:43.770" style="s2">people don&#39;t think it&#39;s even possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:47.010" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how universe manufacture it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.770" end="00:08:49.170" style="s2">but anyway that&#39;s just a little my</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.010" end="00:08:50.490" style="s2">little rant about energy and how it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.170" end="00:08:50.910" style="s2">sold and we can get it out there I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.490" end="00:08:53.580" style="s2">pissed</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:08:55.230" style="s2">well it just it bring it brings up well</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.580" end="00:08:57.090" style="s2">mentioned a few times in in these</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.230" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">conversations is that you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.090" end="00:09:04.340" style="s2">oftentimes excellent solutions already</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:07.170" style="s2">in existence right and yet they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.340" end="00:09:09.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually emerge into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.170" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">world right and so what what are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.000" end="00:09:13.710" style="s2">reasons for that what are the barriers</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:15.000" style="s2">to that and and and that is often I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.710" end="00:09:16.410" style="s2">I know this is a solution raising we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.000" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">here to talk about solutions but it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.410" end="00:09:19.890" style="s2">if they already exist and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:22.230" style="s2">question of opening the gates to their</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.890" end="00:09:23.640" style="s2">implementation then yeah there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.230" end="00:09:25.230" style="s2">point reinventing will that has already</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.640" end="00:09:27.330" style="s2">been invented kind of thing right when</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.230" end="00:09:28.680" style="s2">and a even if you do invent a wheel well</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.330" end="00:09:31.980" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna run into the same problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.680" end="00:09:34.400" style="s2">as this wheel is running into yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.980" end="00:09:37.490" style="s2">more and more and more I&#39;m coming around</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.400" end="00:09:40.830" style="s2">thinking about why aren&#39;t these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.490" end="00:09:42.180" style="s2">emerging into the world right and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.830" end="00:09:44.340" style="s2">this is just one that you know about</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.180" end="00:09:46.020" style="s2">there&#39;s also that I mean I don&#39;t know a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.340" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">great deal about this but I read about</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.020" end="00:09:50.460" style="s2">this in Scientific American or maybe New</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:52.170" style="s2">Scientist whatever but it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.460" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">getting on for 10 years ago I read about</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.170" end="00:09:56.190" style="s2">these thorium reactors right which are</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:09:58.650" style="s2">nuclear reactors but it&#39;s not using</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.190" end="00:10:00.150" style="s2">uranium or plutonium there is no</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.650" end="00:10:01.800" style="s2">possibility of meltdown right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.150" end="00:10:04.050" style="s2">not operating at these kinds of energies</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.800" end="00:10:06.330" style="s2">that could cause meltdown the end</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.050" end="00:10:07.830" style="s2">products of the process is not this</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.330" end="00:10:09.510" style="s2">toxic material that sits around for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.830" end="00:10:11.460" style="s2">hundred thousand years you know emitting</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.510" end="00:10:14.730" style="s2">radiation you know all of those major</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.460" end="00:10:17.640" style="s2">problems of nuclear energy are solved in</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.730" end="00:10:19.650" style="s2">fact it uses waste from a different</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.640" end="00:10:21.240" style="s2">generation of reactor right it uses that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.650" end="00:10:23.190" style="s2">as its raw material to derive energy</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.240" end="00:10:25.710" style="s2">from and turns it into a far far far</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.190" end="00:10:27.840" style="s2">less toxic material so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.710" end="00:10:31.820" style="s2">good in many many many ways a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.840" end="00:10:34.530" style="s2">fears surrounding nuclear energy are</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.820" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">taken away by this technology now why</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.530" end="00:10:39.330" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been pushed along you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.040" end="00:10:41.910" style="s2">what I mean in terms of its development</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.330" end="00:10:43.530" style="s2">and and scalability I don&#39;t know there</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.910" end="00:10:47.570" style="s2">may be technical reasons possibly that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.530" end="00:10:49.710" style="s2">I&#39;m unaware of that was one of the young</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.570" end="00:10:51.960" style="s2">one of the conversations I had with</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.710" end="00:10:53.610" style="s2">somebody and they talked I like very</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.960" end="00:10:56.280" style="s2">like nucular it&#39;s like new killers the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.610" end="00:10:57.840" style="s2">devil because I throw in two new killer</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.280" end="00:10:59.250" style="s2">is not a solution of my books and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.840" end="00:11:01.530" style="s2">talked about exactly that but there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.250" end="00:11:03.060" style="s2">things that argue aren&#39;t losing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.530" end="00:11:04.650" style="s2">determine which is about that so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.060" end="00:11:05.970" style="s2">say from ocean waters that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.650" end="00:11:06.860" style="s2">uranium that don&#39;t have this high</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.970" end="00:11:08.900" style="s2">half-life you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.860" end="00:11:11.240" style="s2">have to keep hold of for thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.900" end="00:11:14.260" style="s2">years and say wait why are why are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.240" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">reason we create each you you Tonio</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.260" end="00:11:20.930" style="s2">duranium is because it is weapon abble</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">whereas this other one isn&#39;t weaponize</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.930" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">Abul so don&#39;t line it so we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:26.300" style="s2">it so and i&#39;m like i&#39;m like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:27.830" style="s2">make any sense to make weapons out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.300" end="00:11:30.710" style="s2">this stuff because we don&#39;t want our</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.830" end="00:11:31.850" style="s2">world to be radioactive I mean all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.710" end="00:11:34.610" style="s2">these things don&#39;t make sense if</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.850" end="00:11:36.200" style="s2">technology exists right now in any any</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.610" end="00:11:37.970" style="s2">of the technology there isn&#39;t a way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.200" end="00:11:39.620" style="s2">get it to market there&#39;s ways to do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.970" end="00:11:41.690" style="s2">if the patent system is what&#39;s breaking</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.620" end="00:11:44.120" style="s2">us there&#39;s ways to overcome that which</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.690" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">we&#39;re showing during COBIT nineteen that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.120" end="00:11:47.240" style="s2">you know and people don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:49.220" style="s2">about the patent system it&#39;s saving</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.240" end="00:11:52.640" style="s2">people&#39;s lives if there&#39;s a way to bring</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.220" end="00:11:54.710" style="s2">stuff to market a way to know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.640" end="00:11:56.750" style="s2">exists currently but like that&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.710" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">person&#39;s proprietary information it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.750" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">just like on the periodic table there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.040" end="00:12:04.670" style="s2">elements that don&#39;t break down as</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">radioactive like and so why aren&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.670" end="00:12:09.400" style="s2">using them and what&#39;s stopping us and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:13.640" style="s2">having that information be much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.400" end="00:12:16.490" style="s2">available to to every everybody so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.640" end="00:12:18.740" style="s2">we can then say right it&#39;s not new</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.490" end="00:12:20.660" style="s2">killers bad no nuclear it&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.740" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">kind of new killer that&#39;s that&#39;s bad and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.660" end="00:12:23.690" style="s2">then how can we make it safe and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:26.600" style="s2">else is out there when someone comes up</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.690" end="00:12:29.540" style="s2">with an idea being able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.600" end="00:12:31.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the word critique it look at what</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.540" end="00:12:34.970" style="s2">what is good and bad about it and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.280" end="00:12:38.090" style="s2">is possible is is new but this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.970" end="00:12:40.460" style="s2">we have to what currently exists exists</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.090" end="00:12:43.190" style="s2">and so you have to almost be perfect to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.460" end="00:12:45.650" style="s2">overcome it it&#39;s like okay gases is and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.190" end="00:12:47.540" style="s2">oil is destroying our environment but we</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.650" end="00:12:49.850" style="s2">understand that one a little bit so then</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.540" end="00:12:51.470" style="s2">if you&#39;re like right so so you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.850" end="00:12:53.270" style="s2">catalyze fusion it&#39;s like whole but that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.470" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">could be radioactive oh there could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.270" end="00:12:56.420" style="s2">implications we don&#39;t understand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:12:59.150" style="s2">like yes but we can see its million</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.420" end="00:13:00.730" style="s2">times better than gas and oil if you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.150" end="00:13:03.140" style="s2">get we don&#39;t know the implications</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.730" end="00:13:04.460" style="s2">decades down the line what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.140" end="00:13:07.790" style="s2">you take de Charney amount of the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.460" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t know we might figure that out in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.790" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">a few decades right and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:14.990" style="s2">roll back and figure out something else</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:16.940" style="s2">yeah Nancy&#39;s to any process right any</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.990" end="00:13:18.920" style="s2">any energy generation process is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.940" end="00:13:19.310" style="s2">have some kind of externalities you</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.920" end="00:13:21.320" style="s2">either got</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.310" end="00:13:23.270" style="s2">manufacturer in order to honest the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.320" end="00:13:25.340" style="s2">energy or you know you&#39;re burning some</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.270" end="00:13:26.750" style="s2">kind of fuel or whatever right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.340" end="00:13:30.470" style="s2">always going to be some so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.750" end="00:13:33.170" style="s2">minimizing them and where possible at</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.470" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">least producing waste products which can</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.170" end="00:13:38.990" style="s2">be processed by nature right which are</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:41.000" style="s2">not toxic to nature final waste products</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.990" end="00:13:43.700" style="s2">which are yeah that then can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.000" end="00:13:46.120" style="s2">reinstated into the ecosystem without</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.700" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">causing damage</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.120" end="00:13:51.110" style="s2">absolutely and so now we can switch over</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:53.240" style="s2">to our newer our newer topic we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.110" end="00:13:56.570" style="s2">on 50 minutes and we&#39;ve already talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.240" end="00:13:58.279" style="s2">about it what is our utopian our version</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.570" end="00:14:00.560" style="s2">of the future of energy look like if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.279" end="00:14:02.960" style="s2">were living in our individualistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.560" end="00:14:04.460" style="s2">version of a perfect society for our</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.960" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">energy needs right what would you like</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.460" end="00:14:11.540" style="s2">this to look like in 10 20 30 years our</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:12.830" style="s2">energy on this planet I mean this this</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:14.540" style="s2">is a little out there I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.830" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">you obviously you&#39;re obviously a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.540" end="00:14:20.060" style="s2">bit open to out there energy sources</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:21.529" style="s2">right because your family&#39;s invested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.060" end="00:14:24.020" style="s2">one which a lot of people could perceive</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.529" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">as being pretty out there right have you</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.020" end="00:14:29.690" style="s2">heard of these toroidal fields these</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:31.970" style="s2">electromagnetic toroidal fields you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.690" end="00:14:33.320" style="s2">create this field in the shape of torus</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.970" end="00:14:35.300" style="s2">and it interacts with the Earth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.320" end="00:14:37.490" style="s2">magnetic field and a magnet moving</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.300" end="00:14:39.290" style="s2">within a magnetic field creates</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.490" end="00:14:42.290" style="s2">electricity right and so these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.290" end="00:14:44.210" style="s2">can supposedly I sort of film about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.290" end="00:14:48.589" style="s2">a while ago but anyway supposedly these</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.210" end="00:14:51.560" style="s2">film these things once creators produce</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.589" end="00:14:53.480" style="s2">energy with no moving parts no burning</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.560" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">of fuel no emissions of any kind you</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.480" end="00:14:58.520" style="s2">know I mean just just just just energy</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">right forever and ever and ever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.520" end="00:15:01.430" style="s2">nothing to wear out you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:05.540" style="s2">there&#39;s no parts need replacing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.430" end="00:15:07.520" style="s2">not it&#39;s so it&#39;s essentially pulling</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.540" end="00:15:09.260" style="s2">energy out of thin air essentially is</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.520" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">what it amounts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.260" end="00:15:13.130" style="s2">so yeah listen I don&#39;t know whether this</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:17.300" style="s2">thing is true or not I mean it was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.130" end="00:15:18.770" style="s2">somewhat they they didn&#39;t go into a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.300" end="00:15:20.390" style="s2">of detail about it but anyway apparently</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.770" end="00:15:22.010" style="s2">the guy that invented this thing was</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.390" end="00:15:24.020" style="s2">he&#39;s you know his family was threatened</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.010" end="00:15:26.540" style="s2">and he burned the plans and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.020" end="00:15:28.640" style="s2">blah blah blah this kind of thing so you</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.540" end="00:15:30.110" style="s2">know it&#39;s a little bit of it I get that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.640" end="00:15:32.089" style="s2">a lot of people would would think this</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.110" end="00:15:33.209" style="s2">is a very sort of yeah yeah Yaeger</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.089" end="00:15:35.610" style="s2">conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.209" end="00:15:37.050" style="s2">nonsense and and it may well be there</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.610" end="00:15:41.179" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not trying to say it</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.050" end="00:15:41.179" style="s2">definitely isn&#39;t that it may well be but</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.389" end="00:15:46.319" style="s2">the point I&#39;m trying to make is that our</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.949" end="00:15:50.309" style="s2">reliance on fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.319" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">absolutely blinds us to the universe of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.309" end="00:15:54.119" style="s2">possibility that there must be out there</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:55.769" style="s2">for the generation of energy right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.119" end="00:15:57.689" style="s2">we don&#39;t even try we don&#39;t even look</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.769" end="00:15:59.639" style="s2">very hard and one of the points this</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.689" end="00:16:02.040" style="s2">film made was that you know the an</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.639" end="00:16:03.990" style="s2">option presents itself we got aha and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.040" end="00:16:06.420" style="s2">just go all-in on that thing right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.990" end="00:16:08.429" style="s2">again forget you know again focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.420" end="00:16:09.929" style="s2">one target forgetting that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.429" end="00:16:11.639" style="s2">whole bunch of other possibilities out</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.929" end="00:16:24.499" style="s2">there that by focusing all that we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.639" end="00:16:24.499" style="s2">now not able to explore the future was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.939" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">weird echo in my own but my feverish in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.490" end="00:16:34.259" style="s2">the future with energy is clearly we</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:36.869" style="s2">have enough energy as individuals and as</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.259" end="00:16:38.189" style="s2">a species that we are able to do all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.869" end="00:16:40.350" style="s2">the things that we want to do grow</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.189" end="00:16:43.709" style="s2">enough nutritious amazing food in cities</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.350" end="00:16:44.939" style="s2">be able to create you know even things</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.709" end="00:16:46.199" style="s2">that I don&#39;t necessarily care but other</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.939" end="00:16:48.749" style="s2">people care about like creating a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.199" end="00:16:51.089" style="s2">fashion piece every single day if that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.749" end="00:16:52.949" style="s2">is your within your values that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.089" end="00:16:54.929" style="s2">going to cost the world the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.949" end="00:16:57.749" style="s2">externalities and energy is a huge piece</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.929" end="00:17:01.170" style="s2">of that I imagine we are gonna come up</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.749" end="00:17:03.119" style="s2">with I would like to see an open source</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.170" end="00:17:05.250" style="s2">energy system or because you come up</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.119" end="00:17:06.899" style="s2">with something you know it&#39;s it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">to be put out in the world if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.899" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">better than what we currently have and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.220" end="00:17:12.449" style="s2">anybody can innovate with it anybody can</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:14.309" style="s2">find and find ways to improve it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.449" end="00:17:16.500" style="s2">that&#39;s available about informations</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.309" end="00:17:18.390" style="s2">available to everyone that having the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.500" end="00:17:20.730" style="s2">actual information on what the energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.390" end="00:17:22.949" style="s2">does it costs us there is no such thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.730" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">as right now free energy so if you have</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:27.659" style="s2">pop it down what went into it what does</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.490" end="00:17:32.130" style="s2">the environmental cost what is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.659" end="00:17:34.380" style="s2">social cost and to be able to have every</p>

<p begin="00:17:39.539" end="00:17:43.470" style="s2">to make the most sense for them to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.130" end="00:17:45.779" style="s2">their energy to be able to get access to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.470" end="00:17:48.529" style="s2">the data to know are they meeting their</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.779" end="00:17:50.969" style="s2">energy needs now and in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.529" end="00:17:52.409" style="s2">be able to have a smart grid so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.969" end="00:17:54.679" style="s2">when there&#39;s something that&#39;s faulty</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.409" end="00:17:57.210" style="s2">with one person or one communities</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.679" end="00:17:59.190" style="s2">hopefully insulated power source right</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.210" end="00:18:01.349" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;s insulated strong word but</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.190" end="00:18:02.849" style="s2">then it can exist off the grid but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.349" end="00:18:04.529" style="s2">connected to the grid so that if one</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.849" end="00:18:06.389" style="s2">just like with food right you&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.529" end="00:18:08.129" style="s2">your own food but if you have a famine</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.389" end="00:18:10.919" style="s2">you can rely on your surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.129" end="00:18:13.289" style="s2">communities if you have a power source</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.919" end="00:18:15.269" style="s2">go down then you have a surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.289" end="00:18:17.159" style="s2">surrounding grid to be able to do and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.269" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">be able to look at alternative energy</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.159" end="00:18:21.960" style="s2">sources and be able to assess is this</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:23.940" style="s2">actually real right do we get energy out</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.960" end="00:18:26.219" style="s2">of me one title is we get energy out of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.940" end="00:18:28.019" style="s2">these magnets when it&#39;s not attached to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.219" end="00:18:29.580" style="s2">the grid do we get other things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.019" end="00:18:34.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t energy out of it right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.580" end="00:18:36.239" style="s2">radiation what is how how efficient is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.440" end="00:18:38.789" style="s2">this and is it safe enough to try and on</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.239" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">what scale and if you&#39;re the person airy</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.789" end="00:18:42.929" style="s2">person under current ma of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:44.369" style="s2">it&#39;s not risky it&#39;s all about me and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.929" end="00:18:46.409" style="s2">profit and even you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.369" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">blinders on but if collectively we want</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.409" end="00:18:51.299" style="s2">better and better energy for less</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:54.539" style="s2">externalized cost we can work on that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.299" end="00:18:57.149" style="s2">together in a way that the for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.539" end="00:18:58.739" style="s2">system can and so I think 1020 years in</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.149" end="00:19:00.089" style="s2">the future we have efficient energy</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.739" end="00:19:01.710" style="s2">sources because I think they already</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.089" end="00:19:02.909" style="s2">exist and I think we just need a system</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.710" end="00:19:05.009" style="s2">to get them out in the world and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.909" end="00:19:06.599" style="s2">ways to actually improve if even if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.009" end="00:19:07.950" style="s2">don&#39;t even if what we have is what was</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.599" end="00:19:10.259" style="s2">in that movie right we have wind and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.950" end="00:19:12.690" style="s2">solar that&#39;s intermittent and it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.259" end="00:19:14.190" style="s2">gonna actually never gonna be but right</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.690" end="00:19:15.509" style="s2">now and it looks like it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.190" end="00:19:17.909" style="s2">decades and decades for it to get to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.509" end="00:19:20.249" style="s2">where we need it to be if it&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.909" end="00:19:21.629" style="s2">source and anyone can innovate as long</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.249" end="00:19:23.820" style="s2">as you&#39;re not mass producing solar</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.629" end="00:19:25.259" style="s2">panels that aren&#39;t efficient I do think</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.820" end="00:19:26.820" style="s2">we can innovate and get it to the point</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.259" end="00:19:28.289" style="s2">you know like when you look at how much</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.820" end="00:19:29.879" style="s2">computers first costs when they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.289" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">here right they were like city blocks</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.879" end="00:19:34.019" style="s2">and millions and millions of dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:36.779" style="s2">now my phone that keeps chiming at me</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.019" end="00:19:38.309" style="s2">and this has more power than mine - I</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.779" end="00:19:39.899" style="s2">think we&#39;re getting messages from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.309" end="00:19:49.320" style="s2">Omega groups of us I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.899" end="00:19:51.119" style="s2">exactly yeah I got to be I got a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.320" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">sidetracked but I started talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.119" end="00:19:54.299" style="s2">that - Roy because what I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:55.979" style="s2">actually trying to put it into the fight</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.299" end="00:19:58.019" style="s2">and I got sidetracked into the context</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.979" end="00:19:59.460" style="s2">of what is the perfect future look like</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.019" end="00:20:02.700" style="s2">right and the perfect future</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.460" end="00:20:04.860" style="s2">is free abundant energy where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.700" end="00:20:07.080" style="s2">even a question right how efficient is</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.860" end="00:20:08.730" style="s2">this and you know what a my energy needs</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.080" end="00:20:11.399" style="s2">and blah blah blah blah blah but that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.730" end="00:20:13.169" style="s2">that is no longer even you know yes so</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.399" end="00:20:14.760" style="s2">abundant it&#39;s like air you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.169" end="00:20:18.630" style="s2">mean you just don&#39;t think about it there</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.760" end="00:20:20.399" style="s2">are you know I mean that&#39;s supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.630" end="00:20:22.590" style="s2">and I don&#39;t fully understand the physics</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.399" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">of this but supposedly in a cubic</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.590" end="00:20:26.309" style="s2">centimeter of empty space there is an</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:27.480" style="s2">infinite amount of energy right and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.309" end="00:20:29.010" style="s2">you know you start tapping into you</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.480" end="00:20:31.649" style="s2">start figuring out ways to tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.010" end="00:20:33.450" style="s2">kind of there is just everywhere in</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.649" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">the universe all the time in infinite</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.450" end="00:20:37.710" style="s2">abundance right and and and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:40.890" style="s2">sudden energy becomes a zero</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.710" end="00:20:43.710" style="s2">consideration so that&#39;s that&#39;s my ideal</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.890" end="00:20:45.029" style="s2">future is it is it&#39;s just that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.710" end="00:20:50.909" style="s2">even think about it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.029" end="00:20:52.679" style="s2">you know for energy itself to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.909" end="00:20:54.510" style="s2">the rest of it we self to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.679" end="00:20:57.659" style="s2">to get you know how to make a table</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.510" end="00:20:59.429" style="s2">without having crap made it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.659" end="00:21:02.220" style="s2">table right without having all of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.429" end="00:21:04.350" style="s2">byproducts with anything we make but</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.220" end="00:21:05.580" style="s2">energy is a huge part of it if we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.350" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">create energy without the massive</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.580" end="00:21:10.140" style="s2">byproducts and we have clean energy that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:12.929" style="s2">is cheap because it&#39;s just plentifully</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.140" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">available I mean I know Tesla came up</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.929" end="00:21:18.110" style="s2">with some kind of energy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.250" end="00:21:20.909" style="s2">everywhere and then of course Edison</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.110" end="00:21:22.440" style="s2">micro microwaved electrocuted an</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.909" end="00:21:25.020" style="s2">elephant to prove that it was unsafe</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.440" end="00:21:26.010" style="s2">right and now we know it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.020" end="00:21:32.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even exist</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.010" end="00:21:36.090" style="s2">I see tapping into that that is free and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.970" end="00:21:37.529" style="s2">available everywhere yeah man I have no</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.090" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">doubt the universe is a mysterious place</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.529" end="00:21:41.580" style="s2">right I mean I&#39;ve known have no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:44.039" style="s2">assuming we stay around long enough to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.580" end="00:21:45.929" style="s2">do so that we will tap into reserves of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.039" end="00:21:47.549" style="s2">energy that we at present we have no</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.929" end="00:21:50.279" style="s2">idea they even exist you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.549" end="00:21:52.260" style="s2">mean and we&#39;ll find this stuff I have no</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.279" end="00:21:54.299" style="s2">doubt if we as I say if we can stay</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.260" end="00:21:56.279" style="s2">around long enough to be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.299" end="00:21:58.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the great challenge right is can</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.279" end="00:22:00.539" style="s2">we can we achieve abundance and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.860" end="00:22:04.500" style="s2">before we wipe ourselves out in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.539" end="00:22:06.419" style="s2">ignorance and and excessive power</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.500" end="00:22:09.179" style="s2">without the wisdom to temperate that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.419" end="00:22:12.990" style="s2">that&#39;s the great question yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.179" end="00:22:15.000" style="s2">think basically any scale we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.990" end="00:22:16.260" style="s2">well it&#39;s just because the same things</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.000" end="00:22:18.540" style="s2">keep coming up at all these solution</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.260" end="00:22:22.890" style="s2">races right it&#39;s trust it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.540" end="00:22:25.559" style="s2">information and it&#39;s like and so there</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.890" end="00:22:27.690" style="s2">are a few things that we can solve</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.559" end="00:22:29.850" style="s2">together that are actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.690" end="00:22:31.380" style="s2">powerful and if you want we can switch</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.850" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">over into the next sections it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.380" end="00:22:36.420" style="s2">like almost there anyway of what could</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:39.800" style="s2">we actually create now energies are hard</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.420" end="00:22:39.800" style="s2">one because like what can you create</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.980" end="00:22:45.750" style="s2">it&#39;s hard on small scales to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.580" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">impactful and significant with energy I</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.750" end="00:22:52.020" style="s2">mean I think something wrong something</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:53.820" style="s2">around the reduction in demand right on</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.020" end="00:22:55.380" style="s2">the kind of scale we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.820" end="00:22:58.110" style="s2">ten thousand people a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.380" end="00:23:00.570" style="s2">dollars so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.110" end="00:23:03.510" style="s2">resilience and it&#39;s about reduction in</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.570" end="00:23:05.450" style="s2">demand and so figuring out ways I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.510" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">trying to think of things that you could</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.450" end="00:23:11.610" style="s2">collaborate your energy usage on you</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:14.790" style="s2">know like for example water heating</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.610" end="00:23:16.860" style="s2">could you have one central tank between</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.790" end="00:23:18.450" style="s2">four houses which is large enough to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.860" end="00:23:19.860" style="s2">service all four has it but it&#39;s cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.450" end="00:23:22.020" style="s2">to heat the one tank them to heat four</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.860" end="00:23:23.640" style="s2">separate tanks in before now something</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.020" end="00:23:25.920" style="s2">like that for example and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.640" end="00:23:28.050" style="s2">if that&#39;s technically feasible but but</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.920" end="00:23:29.429" style="s2">but something like that some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.050" end="00:23:32.910" style="s2">economy of scale that could be achieved</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.429" end="00:23:35.690" style="s2">at relatively small scales right but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.910" end="00:23:38.550" style="s2">that would make a significant difference</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.690" end="00:23:39.870" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the sort of line I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.550" end="00:23:41.070" style="s2">going down I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.870" end="00:23:44.220" style="s2">what you think but it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.070" end="00:23:45.870" style="s2">generation on any kind of scale is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.220" end="00:23:47.309" style="s2">possible it is its generation of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.870" end="00:23:49.230" style="s2">anything is not really possible of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.309" end="00:23:50.550" style="s2">kind of scale meaningful generation is</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.230" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">not possible with that part of scale it</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.550" end="00:24:01.980" style="s2">seems to me what we&#39;re looking to do is</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:03.179" style="s2">create energy on a massive scale for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.980" end="00:24:03.990" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.179" end="00:24:05.730" style="s2">gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.990" end="00:24:07.559" style="s2">for ten thousand people no we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.730" end="00:24:08.970" style="s2">generate electricity for ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.559" end="00:24:11.130" style="s2">people four hundred thousand dollars but</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.970" end="00:24:14.010" style="s2">what we could do with ten thousand beep</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.130" end="00:24:17.370" style="s2">$100,000 is map our current energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.010" end="00:24:19.500" style="s2">consumption in that like I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.370" end="00:24:21.390" style="s2">Vancouver I don&#39;t really have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.500" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">in how Vancouver creates their energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.390" end="00:24:24.999" style="s2">but I also don&#39;t really know how Bank</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">uber great sir</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.999" end="00:24:29.259" style="s2">like I know it&#39;s hydro I know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:30.309" style="s2">hydro down but I don&#39;t actually know how</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.259" end="00:24:32.469" style="s2">long has it been there when it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.309" end="00:24:33.879" style="s2">happier place how much energy is in what</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.469" end="00:24:35.709" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be better in Vancouver right</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.879" end="00:24:37.689" style="s2">clearly we&#39;re not able to use solar here</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.709" end="00:24:39.819" style="s2">but we might be able to use win we might</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.689" end="00:24:42.309" style="s2">be able to use title what else is out</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.819" end="00:24:43.809" style="s2">there having a system for ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.309" end="00:24:45.429" style="s2">people to say what&#39;s happening in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.809" end="00:24:47.349" style="s2">city and what could be happening in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.429" end="00:24:49.089" style="s2">city what is available out there right</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.349" end="00:24:50.859" style="s2">what companies are worth more initiative</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.089" end="00:24:52.899" style="s2">problem the councillor and making that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.859" end="00:24:54.729" style="s2">information as transparent as possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.899" end="00:24:56.619" style="s2">you mean like commission commission</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.729" end="00:25:00.099" style="s2">surveys that kind of thing use the use</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.619" end="00:25:02.679" style="s2">the resources to Commission you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.099" end="00:25:04.539" style="s2">what&#39;s a commission adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.679" end="00:25:07.959" style="s2">type solutions right I figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.539" end="00:25:09.339" style="s2">you could actually do within that not</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.959" end="00:25:10.599" style="s2">actually do it because you know hundred</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.339" end="00:25:11.859" style="s2">thousand dollars ten thousand he was not</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.599" end="00:25:13.509" style="s2">enough to actually do it but figure out</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.859" end="00:25:14.829" style="s2">what could be done yeah explore the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.509" end="00:25:16.449" style="s2">space is basically what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.829" end="00:25:18.699" style="s2">yeah and also if you start a new</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.449" end="00:25:23.909" style="s2">community right if you&#39;re starting a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.699" end="00:25:26.499" style="s2">tiny you know one one family unit or</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.909" end="00:25:28.929" style="s2">fifty family units what is available</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.499" end="00:25:29.949" style="s2">that we could be off the grid right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.929" end="00:25:31.719" style="s2">what&#39;s the most efficient what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.949" end="00:25:33.969" style="s2">most efficient solar panels even if</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.719" end="00:25:35.259" style="s2">they&#39;re not ideal what is the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.969" end="00:25:37.389" style="s2">efficient for what you&#39;re able to buy</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.259" end="00:25:39.009" style="s2">and to be able to critique that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.389" end="00:25:40.809" style="s2">information right whether the company</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.009" end="00:25:42.999" style="s2">whether the solar panel or whether the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.809" end="00:25:46.149" style="s2">entire technique in general like a dam</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.999" end="00:25:48.669" style="s2">or like to be able to fully see the big</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.149" end="00:25:50.769" style="s2">picture of energy then we can see things</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.669" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">like wait all nucular isn&#39;t bad right</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.769" end="00:25:55.569" style="s2">what does that look like to actually see</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:57.309" style="s2">why we mined uranium and what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.569" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">like versus this other these other</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.309" end="00:26:01.829" style="s2">elements what could that look like when</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:04.659" style="s2">somebody comes up with a new technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.829" end="00:26:07.389" style="s2">if they&#39;re willing and transparent to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.659" end="00:26:08.889" style="s2">like hey you you test it right like you</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.389" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">tell us whether it works off the grid</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.889" end="00:26:13.299" style="s2">and like for ten thousand people could</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.729" style="s2">come up with a critiquing system the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.299" end="00:26:18.689" style="s2">same does something work and is it safe</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.729" end="00:26:22.119" style="s2">and even if they&#39;re not a governing body</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.689" end="00:26:24.939" style="s2">we&#39;re enough we&#39;re if we&#39;re transparent</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.119" end="00:26:26.169" style="s2">and the information is usable the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.939" end="00:26:28.569" style="s2">people can understand it you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.169" end="00:26:32.769" style="s2">actually see oh I can see this this map</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.569" end="00:26:34.119" style="s2">of what look the alternative to nucular</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.769" end="00:26:36.729" style="s2">looks like versus the current nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.119" end="00:26:38.350" style="s2">versus a coal processing plant right you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.729" end="00:26:40.900" style="s2">can actually see the off foot</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.350" end="00:26:43.179" style="s2">and see if you power a city on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.900" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">versus this if your coal processing</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.179" end="00:26:45.940" style="s2">plant is going down and your government</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:48.130" style="s2">is saying oh yes we&#39;re gonna create a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.940" end="00:26:49.720" style="s2">nuclear one is nuclear actually the best</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.130" end="00:26:51.100" style="s2">option how do we compare all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.720" end="00:26:53.020" style="s2">health of all of the places particular</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.100" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">power right with all the places coal</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.020" end="00:26:57.640" style="s2">processing power there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:27:00.820" style="s2">information we can get with data and in</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.640" end="00:27:02.830" style="s2">from end when it&#39;s available and usable</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.820" end="00:27:04.419" style="s2">to the rest of the population it gives</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.830" end="00:27:05.770" style="s2">us power in a way we don&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.419" end="00:27:07.630" style="s2">have it because right now we&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.770" end="00:27:10.090" style="s2">I mean two people talking of like hey do</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.630" end="00:27:12.580" style="s2">I know if you do on catalyze Fusion is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.090" end="00:27:14.950" style="s2">real know even though I&#39;m invested on</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.580" end="00:27:18.549" style="s2">you know if this back you know magnets</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.950" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">are no we&#39;re just broadly speaking open</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.549" end="00:27:22.450" style="s2">to the to the possibility that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:24.100" style="s2">whole bunch of possibilities out there</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.450" end="00:27:26.590" style="s2">you know what I mean yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.100" end="00:27:28.510" style="s2">um I mean it doesn&#39;t really fit in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.590" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">10,000 people hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.510" end="00:27:32.770" style="s2">but what he was saying before about</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:34.090" style="s2">small communities again I&#39;m pulling</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.770" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">numbers out of thin air this is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.090" end="00:27:38.500" style="s2">based on knowledge or research kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:41.860" style="s2">thing but it seems to me that 30 40 50</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.500" end="00:27:43.690" style="s2">households that kind of size you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.860" end="00:27:45.610" style="s2">every house has a couple of panels on</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.690" end="00:27:47.470" style="s2">the roof and every house has a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.610" end="00:27:49.230" style="s2">it&#39;s just a little one little wind</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.470" end="00:27:53.409" style="s2">turbine on the roof as well and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.230" end="00:27:55.900" style="s2">everybody&#39;s poop goes into a digester</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.409" end="00:27:57.490" style="s2">which produces fertilizer and gas right</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.900" end="00:27:59.289" style="s2">and you can store the gas and use that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.490" end="00:28:01.240" style="s2">to run a generator and you&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.289" end="00:28:04.150" style="s2">battery storage capacity azrael you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.240" end="00:28:05.830" style="s2">having this diversification of power</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.150" end="00:28:08.200" style="s2">generation right where you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.830" end="00:28:10.419" style="s2">reliant on any one of them but but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.200" end="00:28:12.400" style="s2">combination of all of them gives you an</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.419" end="00:28:14.440" style="s2">abundance of power right and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.400" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">the ability to store in the form of gas</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.440" end="00:28:19.270" style="s2">and in the form of batteries right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">and and you know that and this is not I</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.270" end="00:28:24.130" style="s2">mean the technology to do all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.270" style="s2">is is easily available right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.130" end="00:28:29.799" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a question of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.270" end="00:28:31.539" style="s2">organization and then the strain on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.799" end="00:28:34.299" style="s2">coal or the gas or the nuclear or</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.539" end="00:28:35.590" style="s2">whatever it may be stations is way way</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.299" end="00:28:37.929" style="s2">way which is because for the vast</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.590" end="00:28:39.460" style="s2">majority of the time these things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.929" end="00:28:41.289" style="s2">entirely self-sufficient and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.460" end="00:28:43.030" style="s2">in times of exceptional demand or some</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.289" end="00:28:45.610" style="s2">kind of catastrophe that befalls them</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.030" end="00:28:47.650" style="s2">that there is the need for the grid</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.610" end="00:28:49.179" style="s2">itself right and so you can you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.650" end="00:28:50.980" style="s2">can be sort of semi off-grid still</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.179" end="00:28:52.310" style="s2">connects to the grid but producing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.980" end="00:28:54.800" style="s2">majority of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.310" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">demand on the grid is minimal and</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.800" end="00:29:01.430" style="s2">occasional sort of thing you see what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:03.530" style="s2">mean and and that that kind of fractal</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.430" end="00:29:05.450" style="s2">model right where at every level of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.530" end="00:29:07.190" style="s2">organization there is energy being</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.450" end="00:29:09.230" style="s2">produced and there and thus there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.190" end="00:29:12.620" style="s2">redundancy and resilience and slack</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.230" end="00:29:15.080" style="s2">across the system at all kinds of scales</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.620" end="00:29:17.030" style="s2">and I know this isn&#39;t in the $10,000 a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.080" end="00:29:18.230" style="s2">hundred thousand people but but there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.030" end="00:29:19.640" style="s2">a role to be played at the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.230" end="00:29:21.710" style="s2">scales is what I&#39;m saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.640" end="00:29:23.930" style="s2">they&#39;re happy and yeah for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.710" end="00:29:25.340" style="s2">thousand dollars you can put some solar</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.930" end="00:29:27.110" style="s2">panels and a couple of batteries in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.340" end="00:29:29.420" style="s2">home you know what I mean and and make</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.110" end="00:29:32.810" style="s2">us be making a small contribution to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.420" end="00:29:34.550" style="s2">their overall resilience yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.810" end="00:29:36.950" style="s2">also even just knowing like how many</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.550" end="00:29:38.330" style="s2">people in Vancouver have solar and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.950" end="00:29:41.240" style="s2">are they getting out of that right like</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.330" end="00:29:42.590" style="s2">how much is getting reput back into how</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">much are they reliant on the green</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.590" end="00:29:46.430" style="s2">versus before and just having access</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:49.190" style="s2">that data if people are able to give</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.430" end="00:29:53.810" style="s2">access that data but having I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.190" end="00:29:55.460" style="s2">know like a solutions contest um if</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.810" end="00:29:57.620" style="s2">there were enough of us writing it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.460" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">word-of-mouth was enough for marketing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.620" end="00:30:03.620" style="s2">to be able to run a contest to say who</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:05.450" style="s2">solved energy right who currently is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.620" end="00:30:06.590" style="s2">sitting on something that solves energy</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.450" end="00:30:08.570" style="s2">and if they&#39;re willing to put that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.590" end="00:30:11.420" style="s2">information out there to say hey how</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.570" end="00:30:15.110" style="s2">could we create a government a sorry a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.420" end="00:30:17.330" style="s2">lake a body to assess right to say yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.110" end="00:30:19.100" style="s2">is it safe what goes into it how do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.330" end="00:30:21.470" style="s2">know what goes into it right and and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.100" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">few hundred thousand people can create</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:25.370" style="s2">that process of what would we trust</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">right how would we know that this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.370" end="00:30:28.760" style="s2">this is actually a solution to our</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:30.530" style="s2">problems it creates better cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.760" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">energy and there&#39;s less pollution and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.530" end="00:30:35.180" style="s2">environmental cost versus what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:38.710" style="s2">sold right but of course it&#39;s it&#39;s solar</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.180" end="00:30:42.110" style="s2">panel it&#39;s environmentally friendly</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.710" end="00:30:44.360" style="s2">actually like it&#39;s the word like</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.110" end="00:30:45.890" style="s2">collecting solutions that exist and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.360" end="00:30:48.740" style="s2">assessing them and then looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.890" end="00:30:50.360" style="s2">holes of well if we had you know the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.740" end="00:30:51.860" style="s2">energy from this one and this from this</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.360" end="00:30:54.410" style="s2">one and we were able to create something</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.860" end="00:30:56.750" style="s2">from the ground like having the ability</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.410" end="00:30:57.950" style="s2">to win somebody has an idea bring it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.750" end="00:31:00.380" style="s2">market but right whenever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.950" end="00:31:01.610" style="s2">starting there&#39;s already tons of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.380" end="00:31:03.740" style="s2">out there right someone who came up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.610" end="00:31:06.200" style="s2">it the 70s in the 80s and the 90s anyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.740" end="00:31:09.050" style="s2">sitting on anything what</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.200" end="00:31:10.760" style="s2">what is it and what was it like how can</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.050" end="00:31:12.140" style="s2">we use it and make it better right is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.760" end="00:31:13.520" style="s2">available to be bought right now because</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.140" end="00:31:14.780" style="s2">then if there were solar panels that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.520" end="00:31:16.970" style="s2">available in the market right now which</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.780" end="00:31:19.520" style="s2">one&#39;s actually the best and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.970" end="00:31:21.050" style="s2">bulk buy them and then yes it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.520" end="00:31:24.740" style="s2">paying $10 to get information to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.050" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">data not we always makes me laugh have</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.740" end="00:31:28.100" style="s2">you always basically come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.780" style="s2">right what we need is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.100" end="00:31:31.310" style="s2">organizing information in an effective</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">way so we have access certainty to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.310" end="00:31:36.350" style="s2">good decisions and their marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:38.060" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean you were gonna you said</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.350" end="00:31:40.280" style="s2">a while ago that you were gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.060" end="00:31:43.370" style="s2">putting these solution raisings together</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.280" end="00:31:49.580" style="s2">in sort of sort of bigger was that these</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.370" end="00:31:51.890" style="s2">these yeah and that is that is the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.580" end="00:31:53.630" style="s2">two overriding mess of themes that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.890" end="00:31:54.860" style="s2">taken from the ones that I&#39;ve been and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.630" end="00:31:58.330" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved in quite a few of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.860" end="00:32:01.550" style="s2">them is that the construction of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.330" end="00:32:04.940" style="s2">platforms that allow access to and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.550" end="00:32:07.880" style="s2">contribution to and Trust in information</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.940" end="00:32:10.070" style="s2">right and secondly transparency up and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.880" end="00:32:12.710" style="s2">down in every direction right complete</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.070" end="00:32:14.030" style="s2">transparency in how things are done how</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.710" end="00:32:16.400" style="s2">decisions will arrive there how</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.030" end="00:32:19.910" style="s2">resources are allocated bla bla bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.400" end="00:32:21.860" style="s2">bla and yeah and I and I absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.910" end="00:32:23.900" style="s2">agree with that I&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.860" end="00:32:25.400" style="s2">those are the obvious mess of themes</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.900" end="00:32:26.810" style="s2">that have come through again and again</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.400" end="00:32:29.870" style="s2">and again and again and again every</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.810" end="00:32:33.260" style="s2">single context right those come through</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.870" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">as as the important things so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.260" end="00:32:37.580" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that seems to me to be I</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.860" style="s2">mean I that could also be because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.580" end="00:32:41.720" style="s2">usually just the same small group of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.860" end="00:32:44.050" style="s2">people right and so there&#39;s maybe just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.720" end="00:32:46.340" style="s2">reflection of that we all think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.050" end="00:32:50.120" style="s2">you could make this argument as well</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.340" end="00:32:52.070" style="s2">right so yeah I mean I guess until it</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.120" end="00:32:53.720" style="s2">goes out to a wider audience and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.070" end="00:32:55.280" style="s2">same kind of conversations ahead and see</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.720" end="00:32:57.470" style="s2">if they come up with the same with you</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.280" end="00:32:59.630" style="s2">know those themes also come up again and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.470" end="00:33:01.520" style="s2">again and again in a wider audience that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.630" end="00:33:03.260" style="s2">would be yeah that would be really</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.520" end="00:33:05.960" style="s2">interesting to find out wouldn&#39;t it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.260" end="00:33:08.210" style="s2">it&#39;s such a shame that this hasn&#39;t over</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.960" end="00:33:09.830" style="s2">the time I it&#39;s great that you keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.210" end="00:33:12.290" style="s2">plugging away at it it really is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.830" end="00:33:14.600" style="s2">just such a shame and I have to I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.290" end="00:33:15.980" style="s2">been also you know some of which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.600" end="00:33:17.990" style="s2">aware of some of which or not I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.980" end="00:33:20.490" style="s2">been trying to tell other people into it</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.990" end="00:33:22.500" style="s2">and yeah they either come for</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.490" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">then we don&#39;t see him again or they</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.500" end="00:33:30.450" style="s2">don&#39;t come at all the audience I</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">completely get there I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.450" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a shame in terms of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">doing not in terms of you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:38.520" style="s2">popularity and kudos I don&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:41.010" style="s2">in terms that is the thing itself is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.520" end="00:33:43.620" style="s2">just not drawing more people in it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.010" end="00:33:45.990" style="s2">real shame yeah I mean I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.620" end="00:33:47.540" style="s2">if people knew this was going on and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.990" end="00:33:50.100" style="s2">that they could participate in it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.540" end="00:33:51.929" style="s2">there&#39;s a percentage of the populations</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:53.970" style="s2">interested in that right and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.929" end="00:33:55.770" style="s2">it&#39;s 1% of the population that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.970" end="00:33:57.420" style="s2">interested in creating solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.770" end="00:34:01.620" style="s2">having conversations to actually create</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.420" end="00:34:03.420" style="s2">solutions then like you know I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.620" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">need to get to 500 people to find five</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.420" end="00:34:07.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s that&#39;s always kind of one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:09.750" style="s2">the other meta things is marketing right</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.380" end="00:34:11.940" style="s2">if you have a solution for someone how</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.750" end="00:34:15.030" style="s2">do you get the message to the people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.940" end="00:34:23.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a solution for without the lies</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.030" end="00:34:24.780" style="s2">right without testing it is it is like</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.190" end="00:34:27.179" style="s2">if you know and then there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.780" end="00:34:29.010" style="s2">if one celebrity finds it one celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.179" end="00:34:30.810" style="s2">tweets it one then like they&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.010" end="00:34:32.609" style="s2">their prestige to it and then anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.810" end="00:34:34.590" style="s2">can go viral basically overnight it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.609" end="00:34:36.990" style="s2">that this isn&#39;t designed to go viral in</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.590" end="00:34:38.730" style="s2">the way that game a is it&#39;s designed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.990" end="00:34:41.070" style="s2">bring people into the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.730" end="00:34:43.350" style="s2">that&#39;s so right now I am looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.070" end="00:34:45.450" style="s2">old solution racing&#39;s and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.350" end="00:34:46.740" style="s2">what is the best solution we came up</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.450" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">with during them right what is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.740" end="00:34:50.070" style="s2">solution we came up with them to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:52.830" style="s2">what if we have this hole what if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.070" end="00:34:57.869" style="s2">have a basic transportation solution</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.830" end="00:34:59.190" style="s2">that&#39;s feasible like a top five or</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.869" end="00:35:01.410" style="s2">whatever like these are the best things</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.190" end="00:35:05.100" style="s2">that we came up with rather than looking</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.410" end="00:35:06.810" style="s2">at the okay okay I mean you could do</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.100" end="00:35:09.630" style="s2">both I guess you could do well the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.810" end="00:35:11.220" style="s2">is personally because you know I love</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.630" end="00:35:13.500" style="s2">going metal whatever I possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.220" end="00:35:14.940" style="s2">right but for me that the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.500" end="00:35:16.950" style="s2">thing is looking at all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.940" end="00:35:18.540" style="s2">seeing what what were the commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.950" end="00:35:19.109" style="s2">right email you talking about different</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.540" end="00:35:20.520" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.109" end="00:35:22.650" style="s2">what were the commonalities across</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.520" end="00:35:26.030" style="s2">domains that that&#39;s what I would find</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.650" end="00:35:29.160" style="s2">interesting yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s balance</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.030" end="00:35:30.990" style="s2">for each different sector imagine we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.160" end="00:35:32.190" style="s2">this little thing with education and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.990" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">this little thing with health care and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.190" end="00:35:35.560" style="s2">transportation and food</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:36.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not we&#39;re feeding everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.560" end="00:35:38.230" style="s2">world but like hey we have an app that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.970" end="00:35:39.610" style="s2">helps you garden and coordinate with</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.230" end="00:35:41.230" style="s2">your neighbors right wouldn&#39;t that be</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.610" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">cool here&#39;s what we could do with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.230" end="00:35:43.450" style="s2">now imagine we had a world with all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:44.830" style="s2">them right imagine we have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.450" end="00:35:46.750" style="s2">education this one this one</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.830" end="00:35:48.040" style="s2">none of them are unfeasible right none</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.750" end="00:35:50.080" style="s2">of them are taking down your government</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.040" end="00:35:51.610" style="s2">and starting from scratch and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.080" end="00:35:54.430" style="s2">well we could actually do together and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.610" end="00:35:57.880" style="s2">then from that also there are some very</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.430" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">obvious meta solutions that run through</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.880" end="00:36:00.910" style="s2">all of them right which was what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:03.610" style="s2">were talking about these the marketing</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.910" end="00:36:05.230" style="s2">platform a way to get information part</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.610" end="00:36:07.330" style="s2">of the issue is some of them are much</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.230" end="00:36:08.200" style="s2">more financially lucrative right if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.330" end="00:36:09.670" style="s2">have something where you&#39;re collecting</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.200" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">money and you&#39;re keeping a percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.670" end="00:36:13.150" style="s2">it and that can fund a ton of other</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:14.740" style="s2">stuff but if we&#39;re starting with</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.150" end="00:36:16.660" style="s2">something that we don&#39;t naturally fund</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.740" end="00:36:18.970" style="s2">like an information system right we</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.660" end="00:36:20.620" style="s2">don&#39;t pay for Wikipedia then you need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.970" end="00:36:21.730" style="s2">find 10,000 people who are the goodness</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.620" end="00:36:23.380" style="s2">of their heart want to create this for</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.730" end="00:36:24.990" style="s2">the goodness of humanity who exists but</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.380" end="00:36:27.160" style="s2">it&#39;s finding them amongst the population</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.990" end="00:36:32.770" style="s2">whereas if we&#39;re creating one that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.160" end="00:36:34.780" style="s2">very if we&#39;re creating one that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.770" end="00:36:36.910" style="s2">universally needed and generates</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.780" end="00:36:42.370" style="s2">finances then it you know I mean it self</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.910" end="00:36:52.630" style="s2">self funding itself people will seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.370" end="00:36:54.040" style="s2">this alright let&#39;s do that I decide you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.630" end="00:36:56.230" style="s2">want to put what Matt said up here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.040" end="00:36:57.640" style="s2">check out their red grid I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.230" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">this this project but I would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.640" end="00:37:02.410" style="s2">interested in talking to the person who</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:03.640" style="s2">is and ya know there&#39;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:06.040" style="s2">cool stuff happening with all the chain</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.640" end="00:37:07.390" style="s2">and Dow stack and it&#39;s definitely part</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.040" end="00:37:09.370" style="s2">of it I&#39;m guessing this is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.390" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">percentage of people you think is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.370" end="00:37:12.850" style="s2">think it&#39;s much higher than that and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:16.870" style="s2">think we can see that in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.850" end="00:37:18.520" style="s2">now that there are people people looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.870" end="00:37:20.200" style="s2">to create a better world together and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.520" end="00:37:21.880" style="s2">think it&#39;s not much there&#39;s a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.200" end="00:37:23.380" style="s2">fraction the population who it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.880" end="00:37:25.720" style="s2">their biggest mission and they will</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.380" end="00:37:28.360" style="s2">sacrifice and do but most of us care</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.720" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">enough that like if it was 5% extra</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.360" end="00:37:32.650" style="s2">money to not use child slave labor and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:34.060" style="s2">we knew that they would like we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.650" end="00:37:35.800" style="s2">choose the one without it I think most</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.060" end="00:37:37.900" style="s2">of us do you care it&#39;s how hard is it to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.800" end="00:37:40.090" style="s2">care how arduous is it to care and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.900" end="00:37:42.040" style="s2">dealing with that and then sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.090" end="00:37:42.820" style="s2">tax it&#39;s not a tax any more than Netflix</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.040" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">as a tax</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.820" end="00:37:46.780" style="s2">look it&#39;s like that you&#39;re choosing to</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:47.299" style="s2">put in X amount of money you&#39;re choosing</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.780" end="00:37:49.729" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.299" end="00:37:51.829" style="s2">to give money to the you know Red Cross</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.729" end="00:37:54.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not attacks it&#39;s a donation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.829" end="00:37:56.179" style="s2">somewhere in between a membership fee</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.380" end="00:37:57.829" style="s2">and a donation right that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.179" end="00:37:59.869" style="s2">choosing to be part of this you choosing</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.829" end="00:38:01.339" style="s2">to co-create a solution together we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.869" end="00:38:02.809" style="s2">not actually collecting ten dollars from</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.339" end="00:38:03.829" style="s2">each of the 10,000 people we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.809" end="00:38:05.239" style="s2">the 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.829" end="00:38:07.429" style="s2">but right now what I&#39;m looking to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.239" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">Eric so I&#39;ve been going live at 8:30 in</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.429" end="00:38:13.099" style="s2">the morning every morning and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:14.899" style="s2">so working for me as an individual so</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.099" end="00:38:16.789" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do next week I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.899" end="00:38:20.059" style="s2">off just that from the week except for</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.789" end="00:38:21.439" style="s2">we&#39;ll do a solution raising and then the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.059" end="00:38:23.689" style="s2">week after I want to have four different</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.439" end="00:38:25.759" style="s2">conversations that I want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.689" end="00:38:27.499" style="s2">in at the same time but on different</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.759" end="00:38:31.579" style="s2">days so the solution raising will be one</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.499" end="00:38:33.559" style="s2">of them one of the other ones what are</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.579" end="00:38:35.390" style="s2">the other two three one is a process</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.559" end="00:38:37.489" style="s2">raising what is actually finding a group</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.390" end="00:38:39.859" style="s2">of people who want to continually talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.489" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">have a conversation about what could it</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.859" end="00:38:43.039" style="s2">look like to create something with</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">10,000 people right so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.039" end="00:38:48.409" style="s2">raising a process that to find and work</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:50.390" style="s2">with 10,000 people to create a solution</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.409" end="00:38:52.009" style="s2">and then implement it right we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.390" end="00:38:53.479" style="s2">going to start with 10,000 but we&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.009" end="00:38:54.619" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal so starting with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.479" end="00:38:56.149" style="s2">hundred people how could we work through</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.619" end="00:38:57.829" style="s2">a solution to actually create something</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.149" end="00:38:59.929" style="s2">right and then with those hundred we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.829" end="00:39:01.309" style="s2">find yeah finding the hundreds are bit I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.929" end="00:39:04.099" style="s2">think one see once you&#39;ve got a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.309" end="00:39:05.539" style="s2">I think the 10,000 getting to 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.099" end="00:39:07.459" style="s2">from 100 it&#39;s probably easier than</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.539" end="00:39:09.529" style="s2">getting from zero to a hundred I reckon</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.459" end="00:39:11.179" style="s2">absolutely yeah but it&#39;s getting people</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.529" end="00:39:12.589" style="s2">together getting a handful of people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.179" end="00:39:14.089" style="s2">want to have that conversation both how</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.589" end="00:39:15.619" style="s2">do we grow it but also what do we do if</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.089" end="00:39:17.569" style="s2">we grow it right if there were 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.619" end="00:39:19.279" style="s2">people right now how do we work through</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.569" end="00:39:21.949" style="s2">a solution very significant besides</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.279" end="00:39:26.749" style="s2">give us your $10 and we&#39;ll create it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.949" end="00:39:29.089" style="s2">even then I wonder how about this how</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.749" end="00:39:32.389" style="s2">about using the same notion but wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.089" end="00:39:34.369" style="s2">but fractal izing it right and so first</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.389" end="00:39:35.929" style="s2">of all you have a process raising for</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.369" end="00:39:37.789" style="s2">how do we get ten people together and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.929" end="00:39:39.199" style="s2">then when you&#39;ve got ten then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.789" end="00:39:41.419" style="s2">process raised but how do we get the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.199" end="00:39:43.069" style="s2">hundreds together and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.419" end="00:39:44.959" style="s2">process raising four right what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.069" end="00:39:50.749" style="s2">when we&#39;ve got 10,000 and how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.959" end="00:39:53.389" style="s2">the 10,000 you know with an amazing idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.749" end="00:39:55.459" style="s2">for 10,000 and we don&#39;t need to fractal</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.389" end="00:39:56.329" style="s2">it right but but chances are 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.459" end="00:39:58.519" style="s2">are gonna need to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.329" end="00:40:00.199" style="s2">solution for a hundred we&#39;re gonna need</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.519" end="00:40:00.820" style="s2">to composition 4,000 or gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.199" end="00:40:04.570" style="s2">come up with</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.820" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">so it is my guess it&#39;s capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.570" end="00:40:11.620" style="s2">just said capitalism I don&#39;t mind that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">quite like that the synthesis right the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.620" end="00:40:17.290" style="s2">yen that&#39;s very very little to do where</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:18.910" style="s2">I mean it exists it has to come through</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.290" end="00:40:21.720" style="s2">capitalism because capitalism is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.910" end="00:40:23.830" style="s2">permeating current world view so</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.720" end="00:40:25.240" style="s2">anything that comes out of the current</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.830" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">world has to come out of this this</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.240" end="00:40:29.790" style="s2">existing marketplace and it&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:33.340" style="s2">create a better world together without</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.790" end="00:40:35.080" style="s2">needing an entire system breakdown right</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.239" end="00:45:13.989" style="s2">shits in there some energy in your house</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.579" end="00:45:15.759" style="s2">has normally you don&#39;t have to go out to</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.989" end="00:45:24.609" style="s2">the thing to and it just runs from</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.759" end="00:45:25.959" style="s2">the toilet into it has an issue we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.609" end="00:45:26.769" style="s2">really don&#39;t interact with the audience</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.959" end="00:45:28.179" style="s2">because the point is to have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.769" end="00:45:30.009" style="s2">conversation but since there&#39;s only two</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.179" end="00:45:31.599" style="s2">of us and Eric talked Eric can I talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.009" end="00:45:33.849" style="s2">how many times a week it&#39;s gonna mention</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:37.630" style="s2">like oh no that&#39;s not that wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.849" end="00:45:43.209" style="s2">one swing bird equals carbon dioxide and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.630" end="00:45:45.189" style="s2">carbon dioxide isn&#39;t bad the carbon to</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.209" end="00:45:47.380" style="s2">me thinks you&#39;re turning the methane</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.189" end="00:45:49.630" style="s2">into carbon dioxide right which is a far</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.380" end="00:45:51.880" style="s2">far far weaker guess I mean which would</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.630" end="00:45:55.179" style="s2">be coming off our poo anyway right at</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.880" end="00:45:57.249" style="s2">least which energy from it so ya know it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.179" end="00:45:58.779" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s entirely green actually I</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.249" end="00:46:00.909" style="s2">understand the Oscar the question you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.779" end="00:46:02.499" style="s2">asking but it is actually entirely green</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.909" end="00:46:05.469" style="s2">we&#39;re turning methane into carbon</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.499" end="00:46:06.909" style="s2">dioxide which is good and yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.469" end="00:46:11.079" style="s2">methane would be coming off anyway it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.909" end="00:46:13.959" style="s2">not like we&#39;re creating the methane we</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.079" end="00:46:16.119" style="s2">breathe it out you poop it out we do all</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.959" end="00:46:17.259" style="s2">of these things but it&#39;s collecting it</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.119" end="00:46:21.429" style="s2">and figuring out what to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.259" end="00:46:24.309" style="s2">like if we live in balance with our</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.429" end="00:46:25.659" style="s2">ecosystem we breathe that out trees free</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.309" end="00:46:27.249" style="s2">that in it works out beautifully it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.659" end="00:46:28.569" style="s2">working we&#39;re never gonna get to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.249" end="00:46:31.349" style="s2">point where we produce zero carbon</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.569" end="00:46:35.559" style="s2">dioxide unless we also breathing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.349" end="00:46:36.939" style="s2">producing it within the balance of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.559" end="00:46:38.930" style="s2">ecosystem there&#39;s enough trees to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.939" end="00:46:40.220" style="s2">breathe it in that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:42.410" style="s2">pumpkin and out there but we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.220" end="00:46:44.839" style="s2"> and then we&#39;re flushing it down</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.410" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">the toilet so that it has to be cleaned</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.839" end="00:46:50.329" style="s2">out or just put into the ocean and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:52.369" style="s2">just bad as opposed to as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.329" end="00:46:55.670" style="s2">we can&#39;t stop so we bought</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.369" end="00:46:59.089" style="s2">Isabella using Nesta comes off it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.670" end="00:47:00.920" style="s2">absolutely absolutely absolutely so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.089" end="00:47:02.599" style="s2">I mean these these kinds of things were</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.920" end="00:47:04.039" style="s2">only minimally explored and like I said</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.599" end="00:47:06.589" style="s2">the solutions and the technology to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.039" end="00:47:09.319" style="s2">this stuff is is and has been around for</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.589" end="00:47:13.390" style="s2">you know a good deal of time nothing new</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.319" end="00:47:13.390" style="s2">nothing fancy pretty easy actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.690" end="00:47:19.450" style="s2">energy is not zero green energy is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.730" end="00:47:22.279" style="s2">better emission than what it was before</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.450" end="00:47:23.960" style="s2">like well I mean the example that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.279" end="00:47:25.640" style="s2">just been talking about using the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.960" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">methane that comes off of poo and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.640" end="00:47:30.140" style="s2">and burning that to produce energy this</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:31.970" style="s2">is actually less than zero emission</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.140" end="00:47:33.829" style="s2">right because you&#39;re taking in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.970" end="00:47:34.970" style="s2">greenhouse I&#39;m talking yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.829" end="00:47:36.650" style="s2">actually less than zero emission because</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.970" end="00:47:39.260" style="s2">you are converting methane which is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.650" end="00:47:41.180" style="s2">very very powerful greenhouse gas into</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.260" end="00:47:43.309" style="s2">carbon dioxide which is a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.180" end="00:47:45.170" style="s2">weak greenhouse gas right and deriving</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.309" end="00:47:47.000" style="s2">energy in the process and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.170" end="00:47:49.430" style="s2">having to burn fossil fuels to get their</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.000" end="00:47:52.940" style="s2">energy which is turning captured carbon</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.430" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">yeah into carbon dioxide sighs a whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.940" end="00:47:58.779" style="s2">different equation I&#39;m afraid of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:58.779" style="s2">missing it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.569" end="00:48:03.799" style="s2">greenhouse gases but we&#39;re emitting</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.369" end="00:48:05.630" style="s2">those greenhouse gases anyway and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.799" end="00:48:07.369" style="s2">amount that we&#39;re emitting is going down</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.630" end="00:48:10.099" style="s2">if we&#39;re climbing is becoming less</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.369" end="00:48:12.380" style="s2">exactly right it&#39;s next its net less</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.099" end="00:48:18.020" style="s2">than zero not just net zero net less</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.380" end="00:48:19.819" style="s2">than zero no I I would I am mrs. M I got</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.020" end="00:48:21.170" style="s2">not the science but the reason why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.819" end="00:48:22.670" style="s2">not for survival is that uses more</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.170" end="00:48:27.380" style="s2">energy that produces it literally can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.670" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">like if this isn&#39;t solar energy stored</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.380" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">in it this is this is how do we use our</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:33.559" style="s2"> we&#39;re out anyway in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.520" end="00:48:37.069" style="s2">system where it&#39;s using the gases off of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.559" end="00:48:38.359" style="s2">it if that system that you input uses</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.069" end="00:48:42.650" style="s2">more energy than it&#39;s ever going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.359" end="00:48:44.299" style="s2">produce and yes but that&#39;s it&#39;s next the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.650" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">only thing that consumes energy is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.299" end="00:48:47.779" style="s2">centrifuge right to get the water air</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:49.490" style="s2">and that just runs through two seconds</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.779" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">as the people but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.490" end="00:48:54.410" style="s2">the embodied energy in all the equipment</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.440" end="00:48:56.510" style="s2">though right like fun no fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.410" end="00:48:57.830" style="s2">yeah yeah fair enough no that&#39;s a valid</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.510" end="00:48:58.490" style="s2">point yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.830" end="00:49:00.140" style="s2">equation</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.490" end="00:49:01.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t but as to the best of my</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.140" end="00:49:03.710" style="s2">knowledge because it&#39;s passive equipment</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.730" end="00:49:05.900" style="s2">you know very very few moving parts and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.710" end="00:49:07.880" style="s2">and nothing to degrade it lasts</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.900" end="00:49:11.270" style="s2">essentially forever as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.880" end="00:49:12.440" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s a fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.270" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">question to which I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.440" end="00:49:16.820" style="s2">the answer so I&#39;m not going to speculate</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:18.530" style="s2">I think this is this is so not okay I</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.820" end="00:49:21.260" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what to say well because</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.530" end="00:49:28.040" style="s2">no we do you know how to stop</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.260" end="00:49:35.210" style="s2">shitty no sorry that&#39;s really not the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.040" end="00:49:37.790" style="s2">same thing is that so that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.210" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">sense those trees are eating our carbon</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.790" end="00:49:42.260" style="s2">dioxide giving us oxygen and cutting</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:43.850" style="s2">them down and burning them is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.260" end="00:49:46.460" style="s2">efficient it&#39;s just economically</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.850" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">efficient if you get yeah anyway your</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.460" end="00:49:51.230" style="s2">shitty shitty so what do you feel like</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:53.420" style="s2">why not use something with it unless</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.230" end="00:49:55.820" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna stop that right if at any</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.420" end="00:49:57.380" style="s2">point this becomes okay everyone we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.820" end="00:49:59.840" style="s2">gonna need to upper this week</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.380" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have enough energy then</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.840" end="00:50:05.030" style="s2">yes that would be highly inefficient but</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:07.640" style="s2">since we&#39;re gonna eat and do this anyway</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.030" end="00:50:09.530" style="s2">and it feeds back in any system becomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.640" end="00:50:11.000" style="s2">manure as well right when it&#39;s safe</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.530" end="00:50:12.650" style="s2">enough when there isn&#39;t the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.000" end="00:50:15.530" style="s2">the pathogens getting passed on from</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.650" end="00:50:19.070" style="s2">humans human it becomes our food source</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.530" end="00:50:22.010" style="s2">as well right now it&#39;s just a toxin and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.070" end="00:50:23.450" style="s2">a byproduct that word that costs us a</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.010" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">lot as opposed to giving us back</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.450" end="00:50:28.369" style="s2">anything and there&#39;s a bunch of fee but</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:30.109" style="s2">like nature&#39;s a feedback system so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.369" end="00:50:31.700" style="s2">fact that you can have fish right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.109" end="00:50:33.020" style="s2">you can have fish per dick that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.700" end="00:50:34.520" style="s2">producing that are feeding the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.020" end="00:50:37.640" style="s2">plants you&#39;re also eating the fish or</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.520" end="00:50:40.910" style="s2">also you&#39;re the fish that&#39;s it like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.640" end="00:50:44.450" style="s2">something we&#39;re we&#39;re also part of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.910" end="00:50:47.210" style="s2">ecosystem we also we also die we</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.450" end="00:50:49.790" style="s2">also here right so like we&#39;re byproducts</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.210" end="00:50:51.800" style="s2">as well and so why not why not use our</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.790" end="00:50:53.570" style="s2"> if it can be done safely if it then</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.800" end="00:50:55.670" style="s2">becomes its own industry or we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.570" end="00:50:58.460" style="s2">to produce we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.670" end="00:51:00.770" style="s2">factories for like force-feeding humans</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.460" end="00:51:03.080" style="s2">to make them so we can use their</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.770" end="00:51:05.810" style="s2">fuel it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.080" end="00:51:07.460" style="s2">he made bad but just collecting it using</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.810" end="00:51:10.220" style="s2">it is not the problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.460" end="00:51:12.740" style="s2">I just cook I just I just had took</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.220" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">delivery of 12 big bags of today</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.740" end="00:51:20.810" style="s2">and paid money for it right is good</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:25.750" style="s2">you know especially after him renew</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.810" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">marae ters their grass eating animals is</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.750" end="00:51:31.430" style="s2">an absolutely essential part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:33.530" style="s2">process so it might at the moment I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.430" end="00:51:34.820" style="s2">it does get used to a certain extent I</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.530" end="00:51:38.180" style="s2">mean oh yeah I don&#39;t know how it works</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.820" end="00:51:40.910" style="s2">in Canada but in in the UK the water</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.180" end="00:51:43.010" style="s2">purification plants they spread the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.910" end="00:51:44.420" style="s2">thinly over it and then they scraped it</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.010" end="00:51:46.040" style="s2">up and they put it in bags and they send</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.420" end="00:51:48.290" style="s2">it off to farms to use as fertilizer so</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.040" end="00:51:50.750" style="s2">it does get used but it could be used</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.290" end="00:51:52.460" style="s2">for that and in getting energy from it</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.750" end="00:51:56.330" style="s2">right and and and all of that one thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.460" end="00:51:58.160" style="s2">that could be yes so decomposing</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.330" end="00:51:59.840" style="s2">vegetables and stuff too right again if</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.160" end="00:52:01.340" style="s2">we&#39;re producing if I&#39;m like well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.840" end="00:52:02.900" style="s2">gonna put this in so we can get energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.340" end="00:52:05.180" style="s2">versus I&#39;m not gonna make this into soup</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.900" end="00:52:06.920" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna use this in any way but</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.180" end="00:52:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s decomposing because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.920" end="00:52:11.630" style="s2">organic matter does why not collect the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.440" end="00:52:12.950" style="s2">gases off of it as it&#39;s decomposing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.630" end="00:52:15.500" style="s2">gonna give off the methane and carbon</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.950" end="00:52:17.660" style="s2">dioxide anyway why not collect it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.500" end="00:52:19.130" style="s2">then burning it like we just have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.660" end="00:52:21.350" style="s2">work with chemistry and physics</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.130" end="00:52:24.560" style="s2">we can&#39;t reinvent chemistry and physics</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.350" end="00:52:25.880" style="s2">like we just methane is a molecule co2</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.560" end="00:52:27.740" style="s2">is a molecule and it has certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.880" end="00:52:29.600" style="s2">implications moving from one to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.740" end="00:52:31.310" style="s2">other and we just have yes we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.600" end="00:52:32.990" style="s2">work with chemistry and physics I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.310" end="00:52:35.360" style="s2">know it and having access that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.990" end="00:52:37.130" style="s2">information of here&#39;s what methane looks</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.360" end="00:52:39.230" style="s2">like here&#39;s at co2 here&#39;s how we make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.130" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">into co2 and then what we do with it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.230" end="00:52:44.270" style="s2">having that be transparent right because</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:45.890" style="s2">it is transparent</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.270" end="00:52:47.990" style="s2">I mean methane is not changing how it</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.890" end="00:52:50.150" style="s2">how it lives its life how it goes</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.990" end="00:52:53.840" style="s2">through a chemical reaction based on</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.150" end="00:52:54.950" style="s2">profits but to have for the individual</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.840" end="00:52:56.420" style="s2">consumer to have access to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.950" end="00:52:58.970" style="s2">information means we can make better</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.420" end="00:53:00.200" style="s2">choices and we can innovate better when</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.970" end="00:53:01.670" style="s2">someone comes up with the new innovation</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.200" end="00:53:02.750" style="s2">to be like who there is a broken piece</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.670" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">of that and fixes it</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.750" end="00:53:06.200" style="s2">emanate release that into the world the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:07.550" style="s2">world&#39;s who are likely to accept it</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.200" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">because they have the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.550" end="00:53:11.810" style="s2">knowledge to understand it and to see if</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:13.550" style="s2">it&#39;s better or worse than what it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.810" end="00:53:17.080" style="s2">currently exists and what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.550" end="00:53:17.080" style="s2">roll it out to more places right</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.220" end="00:53:24.050" style="s2">so what do you think is our most viable</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.750" end="00:53:25.910" style="s2">option we could do to improve either our</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.050" end="00:53:27.020" style="s2">individual energy choices you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.910" end="00:53:30.280" style="s2">doing fine over there</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.020" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">but our individual energy choices or</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.280" end="00:53:36.380" style="s2">have more of an impact on our planetary</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:39.829" style="s2">energy sources but 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.380" end="00:53:42.470" style="s2">100,000 dollars I mean it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.829" end="00:53:44.420" style="s2">that again at that sort of level of</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.470" end="00:53:46.750" style="s2">resolution you know so this relatively</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.420" end="00:53:52.150" style="s2">small scale is what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.750" end="00:53:52.150" style="s2">it seems to me that the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.300" end="00:53:59.060" style="s2">Avenue to explore is that of reducing</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.589" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">impacts so economies of scale as I said</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.060" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">before and changing behaviors wherever</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:05.930" style="s2">possible right instead so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:07.579" style="s2">going to the supermarket I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.930" end="00:54:12.680" style="s2">every three days go once every two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.579" end="00:54:15.319" style="s2">that kind of thing and and and buying as</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.680" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">much as you possibly can from people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.319" end="00:54:18.950" style="s2">produce it locally because that is using</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:20.329" style="s2">a huge amount less energy and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.950" end="00:54:22.540" style="s2">transportation of the stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.329" end="00:54:24.980" style="s2">what I mean you know being aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.540" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">content is not just about how much you</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.980" end="00:54:28.940" style="s2">drive your car and how long you leave</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:30.619" style="s2">your lights on at home and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.940" end="00:54:33.550" style="s2">in changing to low wattage lightbulbs</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.619" end="00:54:35.660" style="s2">and stuff like that it&#39;s not it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.550" end="00:54:37.490" style="s2">everything that you buy what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.660" end="00:54:39.650" style="s2">supply chain what&#39;s the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.490" end="00:54:42.069" style="s2">energy demand in the production of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.650" end="00:54:45.290" style="s2">good you know what I mean are you</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.069" end="00:54:47.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a million things and so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.290" end="00:54:48.890" style="s2">to me that organize it as again coming</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.510" end="00:54:50.839" style="s2">back to what you were saying having</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.890" end="00:54:53.060" style="s2">information organized in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.839" end="00:54:56.450" style="s2">it was possible to see it easily and be</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.060" end="00:54:58.460" style="s2">able to make such choices that would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.450" end="00:55:02.770" style="s2">that would have it that would have an</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.460" end="00:55:05.420" style="s2">immediate and significant impact on</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.770" end="00:55:06.770" style="s2">energy demand and the less you go the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.420" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">less you need the less you burn right</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.770" end="00:55:12.020" style="s2">and it&#39;s as simple as that mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:13.569" style="s2">no we didn&#39;t actually focus during the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.020" end="00:55:16.700" style="s2">solutions but well you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.569" end="00:55:19.190" style="s2">having a way to understand what it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.700" end="00:55:21.589" style="s2">I&#39;m making choices on a daily basis and</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.190" end="00:55:24.349" style="s2">what that impact is and then offering me</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.589" end="00:55:26.390" style="s2">suggestions to have less of an impact in</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.349" end="00:55:30.200" style="s2">a positive way right where it is hey by</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.390" end="00:55:30.680" style="s2">the way you ain&#39;t grocery shopping every</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.200" end="00:55:33.350" style="s2">day this week</p>

<p begin="00:55:43.340" end="00:55:48.220" style="s2">reduce your your impact right and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.260" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">offering hey if you switched over to</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.220" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">this crane instead of this one you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:53.630" style="s2">have less of an impact well I can&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:56.420" style="s2">kids allergic to that one okay yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.630" end="00:55:57.890" style="s2">not about everyone else - it&#39;s about why</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.420" end="00:55:59.510" style="s2">are you making the choices you make and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.890" end="00:56:00.950" style="s2">what I know right do I know whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.510" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">brown rice or white rice that&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.950" end="00:56:05.050" style="s2">an environmental impact I do not and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:07.190" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.050" end="00:56:09.080" style="s2">imagine white rice has more environments</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.190" end="00:56:10.730" style="s2">Lembeck in this process but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.080" end="00:56:12.920" style="s2">if that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.730" end="00:56:14.660" style="s2">having yeah access to the information</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.920" end="00:56:15.980" style="s2">the choices that I do make on what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.660" end="00:56:17.870" style="s2">impact is so I can make better choices</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.980" end="00:56:20.240" style="s2">and making it be more feasible but like</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.870" end="00:56:22.310" style="s2">hey you and your neighbor both went to</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.240" end="00:56:23.630" style="s2">go get a carton of milk on Monday did</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.310" end="00:56:25.310" style="s2">you know if you coordinated you could</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.630" end="00:56:28.460" style="s2">have be all gone to corner you know you</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.310" end="00:56:30.410" style="s2">can appoint one single and creating any</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.460" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">kind of system for data would be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.410" end="00:56:35.900" style="s2">most um advantageous I believe I may be</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:38.600" style="s2">employing more child labor right because</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.900" end="00:56:40.310" style="s2">child labor is free and yeah yes turn</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.600" end="00:56:42.020" style="s2">out get some exercise get some work</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.310" end="00:56:43.460" style="s2">experience so maybe it may be a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.020" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">bit more enforced child labor</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.460" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">oh yeah solution raising child labor</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.710" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">under utilizing that resource I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.230" end="00:57:04.370" style="s2">watching it&#39;s over now so I&#39;m there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:06.500" style="s2">more to watch but this show a BBC called</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.370" end="00:57:08.930" style="s2">the mill and it&#39;s from like the 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.500" end="00:57:10.880" style="s2">when there was the cotton gin E and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.930" end="00:57:14.990" style="s2">the looms and people working there and</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.190" end="01:00:17.520" style="s2">the thing they showcase that what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.690" end="01:00:19.770" style="s2">possible we have a small group of people</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.520" end="01:00:21.330" style="s2">and what collectively is a lot of amount</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.770" end="01:00:23.760" style="s2">money but individually it&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.330" end="01:00:25.740" style="s2">money and that but what I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.760" end="01:00:27.420" style="s2">is people who want to meet weekly to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.740" end="01:00:28.770" style="s2">the process raising to talk about how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.420" end="01:00:30.480" style="s2">we get time people or how do we get</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.770" end="01:00:34.650" style="s2">10,000 people and just continue that</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.480" end="01:00:37.080" style="s2">conversation every week of what when is</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.650" end="01:00:38.970" style="s2">the most impactful project how what do</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.080" end="01:00:39.600" style="s2">we move forward with it how what would</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.970" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">that look like</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.600" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">right cuz we don&#39;t have 10,000 peoples</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:45.720" style="s2">everything&#39;s risky yeah on something and</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:48.420" style="s2">then get 10 people and then get a</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.720" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">hundred people and and yeah I mean much</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.420" end="01:00:54.330" style="s2">as I enjoy these conversations at some</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:57.210" style="s2">point they have to actually actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.330" end="01:00:59.310" style="s2">trying to get that first core of 10</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.210" end="01:01:01.410" style="s2">committed individuals together behind</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.310" end="01:01:02.910" style="s2">one thing whatever it might be I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.410" end="01:01:04.950" style="s2">even care what it is I&#39;m much more</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.910" end="01:01:06.330" style="s2">interested in the process rather than</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.950" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">the thing itself I don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.330" end="01:01:09.450" style="s2">what the thing is that&#39;s any of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:11.100" style="s2">process and then I&#39;m gonna do one</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.450" end="01:01:12.300" style="s2">dedication to the five questions so</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.100" end="01:01:15.090" style="s2">similarly to what we&#39;ve been doing with</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.300" end="01:01:16.560" style="s2">the idea Cafe showing up and just</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.090" end="01:01:18.270" style="s2">answering the five questions over the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.560" end="01:01:20.100" style="s2">course of six to eight weeks hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.270" end="01:01:21.390" style="s2">to create something like our maker group</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.100" end="01:01:23.220" style="s2">right where it&#39;s like we feel more</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.390" end="01:01:24.630" style="s2">connected but I&#39;m hoping that people</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.220" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just participate that on</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.630" end="01:01:29.190" style="s2">camera they want Chris tape on that off</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:31.010" style="s2">of camera Nick inspires other people to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.190" end="01:01:33.600" style="s2">create those right that they create</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.010" end="01:01:36.030" style="s2">groups to explore the five questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.600" end="01:01:37.530" style="s2">because I&#39;m finding it useful for myself</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.030" end="01:01:39.780" style="s2">to explore the five questions but also</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.530" end="01:01:41.430" style="s2">to explore them with a group right to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.780" end="01:01:43.710" style="s2">hear other people&#39;s answers to them and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.430" end="01:01:45.570" style="s2">then the fourth conversation I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.710" end="01:01:46.800" style="s2">to have every week is I don&#39;t know quite</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.570" end="01:01:48.330" style="s2">know what it looks like but it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.800" end="01:01:49.680" style="s2">conversation I enjoy which is like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.330" end="01:01:53.310" style="s2">power of technology and how technology</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:55.980" style="s2">itself can help us but also with game be</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.310" end="01:01:57.300" style="s2">in it right like I don&#39;t want Google and</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.980" end="01:01:58.200" style="s2">Facebook owning the technology I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.300" end="01:02:00.810" style="s2">want our governments doing this</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.200" end="01:02:04.860" style="s2">technology so picking like four or five</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.810" end="01:02:06.600" style="s2">topics every four to five weeks right</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.860" end="01:02:07.650" style="s2">saying hey for the next four weeks here</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.600" end="01:02:09.100" style="s2">are the topics in the next four weeks</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.650" end="01:02:10.810" style="s2">here are the topics but how</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.100" end="01:02:12.370" style="s2">us generate them together so people who</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.810" end="01:02:13.900" style="s2">care about that people who there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.370" end="01:02:14.920" style="s2">enough people in game B who want to have</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.900" end="01:02:18.130" style="s2">I hope who wanna have a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.920" end="01:02:19.780" style="s2">about the power of technology doubt</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.130" end="01:02:21.730" style="s2">staff and homeland chain not caring</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.780" end="01:02:24.370" style="s2">about what the technology is under the</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.730" end="01:02:28.020" style="s2">umbrella of just what can humanity do</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.370" end="01:02:32.350" style="s2">with technology with trust and you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.020" end="01:02:35.140" style="s2">ethics hopefully interwoven in it so</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.350" end="01:02:36.280" style="s2">that is that is what I&#39;m up to at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.140" end="01:02:38.920" style="s2">moment we&#39;re gonna be doing this next</p>
