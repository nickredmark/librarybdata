<p begin="00:17:50.270" end="00:17:55.250" style="s2">is it better to progress to completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.900" end="00:17:59.179" style="s2">complete whole practice and improve each</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.250" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">part over time so this goes to you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.179" end="00:18:04.970" style="s2">sort of like coaching and learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:07.240" style="s2">theory I would recommend that you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.240" end="00:18:13.669" style="s2">like it&#39;s like in the Tai Chi classics</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.309" end="00:18:15.740" style="s2">it&#39;s like drawing a circle freehand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.669" end="00:18:19.850" style="s2">gonna be very rough and then you draw</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.740" end="00:18:21.710" style="s2">other parts all right and then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.850" end="00:18:25.429" style="s2">go through the course but periodically</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.710" end="00:18:28.390" style="s2">do you go back and review and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.429" end="00:18:31.909" style="s2">you know spend two or three sits just</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.390" end="00:18:33.980" style="s2">working on one of the components like</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.950" end="00:18:46.730" style="s2">practice both the gestalt whole and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.409" end="00:18:49.190" style="s2">individual parts that you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.730" end="00:18:50.990" style="s2">moving very fluidly between them so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.190" end="00:18:53.179" style="s2">not a matter of either/or you should be</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.990" end="00:18:55.130" style="s2">moving on but you should also be</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.179" end="00:18:59.740" style="s2">periodically going back in zero and yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.130" end="00:18:59.740" style="s2">on the components zoom in zoom out</p>
