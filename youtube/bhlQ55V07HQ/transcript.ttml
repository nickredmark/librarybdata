<p begin="00:00:02.159" end="00:00:06.000" style="s2">all right welcome to today&#39;s solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.080" end="00:00:08.000" style="s2">raising we are discussing loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:10.880" style="s2">because it is what i am struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:12.880" style="s2">in cobit 19. thank you to carrie for</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.880" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">talking me through some stuff yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">and being a adventurer</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">no problem and so if anyone would like</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:22.240" style="s2">to share currently what loneliness looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:23.920" style="s2">like in the world in your life</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.240" end="00:00:25.519" style="s2">and then of course move on to the second</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.920" end="00:00:28.000" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.519" end="00:00:29.920" style="s2">what we would like it to look like in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:30.640" style="s2">ideal world and then what could actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.920" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">we could do</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.640" end="00:00:34.000" style="s2">to combat loneliness with ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">people and a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.000" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">if and when we have that would anybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:39.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">the funny thing it&#39;s a funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.200" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">lonely i mean i think to an outside</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.719" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">observer if they looked at my life they</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.559" end="00:00:45.280" style="s2">would think</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:46.640" style="s2">i must be lonely right because i spend a</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.280" end="00:00:49.760" style="s2">lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.640" end="00:00:52.000" style="s2">on my own and yet i rarely if ever</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">experience loneliness in a sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">know in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.360" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">bothersome sort of way um and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:01:00.800" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s a very different thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.800" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">for different people i think some people</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">are lonely if they&#39;re on their own for</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">an hour</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">and other people can you know go on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:09.520" style="s2">75-day retreat or whatever on their own</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:10.880" style="s2">what&#39;s his name daniel thorson did a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.520" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">75-day</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.880" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">you know silence on his own retreat you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">know and and i doubt he felt lonely for</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:19.119" style="s2">any of that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:20.479" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s uh that that&#39;s all i really</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.119" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">was gonna that&#39;s what i really want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.479" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">say is that it&#39;s a very different thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">for different people</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">well also yeah that that is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re discussing here is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.960" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">not what society thinks is lonely right</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">like i wouldn&#39;t think of you as lonely</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">unless you told me you were lonely</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like an inner inner feeling i feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">very grateful right now as i have for</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:48.159" style="s2">almost a year</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">for game b and i am not lonely within</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.159" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">game b i found people to talk to about</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:55.119" style="s2">what i want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">but with covid19 i&#39;ve realized how much</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">my in-person community is lacking both</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">the one i thought was here</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">like i suck i haven&#39;t contacted them and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:05.200" style="s2">i haven&#39;t really stayed in contact</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">but also they haven&#39;t checked on me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.200" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">they haven&#39;t and there&#39;s a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">like i&#39;ve never been more lonely than</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">when i&#39;m at a party like when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">at with people who i think should be</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">seen and be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">like with and i feel like i&#39;m not seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">and i&#39;m not accepted and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">and how much of that is on me and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">not the truth and then how much</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">is on the other and is there any any</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">other solution i think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">for most people this world is very</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">lonely even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">introverted and good at meeting people</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">so you have less of a social need and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">you&#39;re good at meeting it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">it can still be a lonely place when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">then put into it when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">extroverted you need even more</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">connection and maybe you suck at getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re autistic maybe you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">some interpersonal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">um which i do like it&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">everything that is out there for</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">connection also is designed to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">people who already</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">are extroverted and already have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">skills it&#39;s like sell yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">to everyone else so you can meet friends</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">instead of making it more easy for</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">people and helping like everyone wants</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">to be seen yet we&#39;re all trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">versions of ourselves so we can be liked</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">by everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">when there&#39;s nothing lonelier than that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">because even if they like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t like you and and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">world i&#39;m living in like the more i</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">become myself the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">i love me and i&#39;m connected and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">finding the right people the people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">do like me and accept me</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">and at the same time the more truly</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">isolated i am because the less i fit in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">and people don&#39;t want me around as much</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">because all i want to talk about is game</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">b</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">or the equivalent but i will let the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">next person sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">i can go um i&#39;m reminded of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">part of a richard rohr book where he</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">the extreme need to really be yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">that any years of his life where he was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">putting up any kind of facade</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">to to be loved more just</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">it never works out in the long run um</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">so that&#39;s seems like that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">um yeah i i like what you said about</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">how there are it does mean different</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">things to different people</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve got introverts and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">got extroverts</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">i like to think of uh part of this as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">the need</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">to be known the need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">know other people but also be known</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">i think that for me i have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">different types of friends</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">um and like ideally they cross all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">boundaries or they they you know i the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">best friends</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">are in these different groups but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">know i&#39;ve got like my athletic</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">friends that i like to go biking with or</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">and then i&#39;ve got some of my more maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">more intellectual friends that we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">just sit around and talk about subjects</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">for hours</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">they don&#39;t always overlap uh some of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">intellectual friends you know the worst</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">thing they could think of is like</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">going running like no way um</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">and some of my um like athletic friends</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily want to just sit</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">and chat for hours um</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">and let&#39;s see uh i had one other thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">maybe it&#39;ll come back to me um</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">yeah those are some of my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">though that it has something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">uh with being known um</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">is oh i was thinking about so</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">uh there are bad cures for loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">and for me</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">i was caught up in addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">drinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">a lot and so that was a bad</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">resolve for loneliness that was numbing</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">um and then you know i actually had to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">distance myself from a lot of friends</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">that are in lifestyles that i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">to participate in anymore</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">and so um kind of halfway through life</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">having to build new connections so i</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:18.960" style="s2">have all these memories with these folks</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2">but we have distance now and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">part of being less lonely to me is</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">building new memories i can&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">and i can&#39;t do school and i can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">different memories that i&#39;ll never get</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">back with</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">folks that i did a lot of substances</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">but i need to build new memories with</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">that are would make better friends</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">um and so it&#39;s like hey let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">build memories by doing extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">that is bonding</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">uh okay um loneliness right</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">well i think i&#39;m going to be one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">these people who ends up</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">dead behind the dawns not phone for six</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">months till the neighbors know the smell</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">because because people will just think</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">i&#39;m up to stuff you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">so um i quite like being on my own but</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">times um because i have a tendency to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">all in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">a kind of friendship and that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">when that&#39;s not forthcoming and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.160" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">like a two-way street then i do feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">lonely and that even though and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">realize i&#39;ve got more</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">acquaintances and really good friends um</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">i came across</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">aristotle&#39;s three types of friendship</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">the other day</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:46.800" style="s2">once uh the first two were utility and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">pleasure so like as you said daniel the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.800" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">utility of friends who</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">you get benefit from or useful to you so</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">while you were at your drinking stage</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">that would have been the utility and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">they don&#39;t last very long obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">people move on</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">and that you know and the pleasure ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">of the ones you like hanging out with</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">but you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t help you grow in any way and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">you can&#39;t maybe talk to them about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the good friendships</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">which they may not like the same things</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">um but today and if you needed any</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">deeper conversations they&#39;d be there and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">to be able to listen</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s all about them so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">giving off love for you rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">being loved themselves sort of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">so yeah so came across that but yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">do do see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">people who are lonely because once once</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">you&#39;ve if you don&#39;t go to university</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">like most people go to university</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">they&#39;ve got friends to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">university and because i kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">moved about a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">and all that at school so you never got</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">to bond with anyone there&#39;s proper</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">friendships and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">when you leave school you you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">the people that you&#39;re at school with</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">and then you&#39;re not in university</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">and may maybe you make friends at work</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">but that&#39;s highly unlikely because</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">nobody wants to see it after work</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">because it reminds you to work</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">um and then where do you go so like</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">after 25 to make friends well you turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">to the internet</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">and then obviously you meet people there</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">and some of them probably aren&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">that great</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">you know what i mean and if you try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">share anything with any depth at</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">all most of them kind of go get a grip</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">of yourself pull yourself together</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">whatever yeah you know i mean so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">really difficult to try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">make friends and i&#39;ve said if you move</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">to different cities</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">as well it&#39;s really difficult now to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">pub used to be a place you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">actually walk into and make friends with</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">and you&#39;d have loads of pubs but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">obviously you&#39;d get drunk at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">the day get into a fucking mess as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">so um you can&#39;t do that you can&#39;t walk</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">into cafes now and just walk up to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">someone and have a chat</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">without them thinking that you&#39;re mad</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">because because there&#39;s actually nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">really um unless you&#39;ve got a specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">interest and if you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">interests</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">um that&#39;s odds as well so and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">as you get older and your husband dies</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">then you&#39;re on your own and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">find that the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">who you&#39;ve been the both of you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">been friends with</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">um you don&#39;t they can&#39;t have a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">to keep away from you because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">know what to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">and they don&#39;t they don&#39;t want to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">you feel like they&#39;re inviting you to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">things that are pity</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">you know i mean so as you get older you</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">realize as friends die</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">and that that you it&#39;s just really odd i</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">think making making proper good friends</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a tendency for us moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">more loneliness especially now</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">so um yeah this is something that i&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">for me it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">the lack of that authentic connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">and i can be lonely in a room full of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">people i&#39;m often alone in a room full of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">but there</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">there is that deep authentic connection</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">i think i crave um</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.079" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">the hill i&#39;m willing to die on and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.240" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">it almost feels sometimes like</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">um because i&#39;ve built that hill</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:30.959" style="s2">that that feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">of of loneliness is more extreme i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.959" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">the case or not or just something</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">imagined</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">but that&#39;s just my experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">yeah if you&#39;ve tasted deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">then the absence of it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">even more painful right if you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">known it then not having it is is far</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">less painful so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">yeah so um if we&#39;d all been here at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">beginning i would have split us into two</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">groups and something tells me that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">supposed to be all six of us that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">we came in at the time we did so we will</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">continue with with this</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">um so now we switch over to the section</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">let&#39;s try to keep it a little briefer</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">since there are six of us</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">uh what you would like to see in your</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">ideal</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.199" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">future either globally like in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">or in your own personal life what is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">what does a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">world look like in 5 10 20 years where</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">you maybe you don&#39;t have loneliness or</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">maybe it is part of who you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">our ideal futures don&#39;t need to match</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">whoever would like to start is welcome</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">well i&#39;ll jump in just because it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">follows on from something that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">to me sort of in the opening section</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">listening to what everyone said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">there seems to be a conflation</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">i&#39;m not necessarily saying it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">but a conflation between</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.519" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">uh lack of loneliness and friendship</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">right friendship with other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">picture right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">like i said i have almost no contact</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">with people on a day-to-day basis right</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">i mean i have the occasional friend or</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">relative come and visit but you know i</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">day in day out go weeks sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">without seeing anyone or even speaking</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">to anyone on the phone or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">and so but the reason i don&#39;t get lonely</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">is that because the connection thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">that mark is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:16.880" style="s2">yeah mark yeah um the the the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">deep connection i think i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">the important thing and whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">with people or whether whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">whether it&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">a sense of purpose in your own life or</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">the or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">you know or the earth or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">might be i i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">so long as you have that sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">to something which is important right</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">then then</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">loneliness is held at bay and so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">in the in</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">in my perfect world everyone has found</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">their place and their purpose right</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:46.959" style="s2">and and their like-minded people</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">naturally gravitate around them because</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.959" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">they have similar purposes right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">and and so yeah loneliness wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">but not as a consequence of better</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">social media or whatever and in making</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">it easier for people to find</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">friends sort of thing but just just</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">because people have a more</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">more whole and and complete in</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">themselves right because they</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">found something in this life which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">important to them which means something</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">something which they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">dedicate themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">uh i can go um</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">i think that in the ideal world i would</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">a way to know</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">who is available for</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">um for talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">or certain things very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">instead of having to text my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">acquaintances and say hey are you free</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">you know there would be a system where</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">they could actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">input their hey i&#39;m free to talk i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:53.280" style="s2">free to talk all evening or hey i&#39;m free</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">uh go play chess or whatever the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">i my ideal world is there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">um where that could be communicated</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">uh by choice i i think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">super cool</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:14.799" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d say that&#39;s i&#39;d agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">actually i think um i think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.799" end="00:18:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit of a bit of both to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.240" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">um being also uh partly</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">sort of slightly like having a better</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">social media but one that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">kind of intrusive and i guess it would</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">sort of intrusive i think that&#39;s where i</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">kind of see uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">this kind of potential is is making it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">more efficient for people to find what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">what&#39;s meaningful for them</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">and then finding the people that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">they need to be able to go and do that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">and then they</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">feel as though you know they have a more</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">import you know they have importance in</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">life they have</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">found people that are just as unique as</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">are but in very similar ways that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">complement each other so i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:18:59.520" style="s2">the only way we&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">actually kind of be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:05.679" style="s2">around their kind of common values is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">by some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.679" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">understanding of of who we are whether</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">you know and somehow you know have that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">through some kind of use of use of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">technology to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">you know capture us in our real um</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">you know in our real being and then be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">able to find those connections with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">people that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.520" style="s2">that we need so i think i&#39;m i agree i</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">think it&#39;s one of these things where</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">it feels like it needs to be fluid and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">it needs to be like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">easy you don&#39;t have to you know uh be</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">making like</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">effort to talk to this person this but</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">you know what i mean it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">it needs to feel more fluid i think our</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">technology has like separated us a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">from our</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">um our kind of experience of of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">connecting people i think if we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">bring back that synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">in how we interact online that could</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">that could be a step i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">i love that i love that english</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">understatement i miss it separated us a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">bit from our</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">yeah just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">you gotta be honest i mean it&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">us together at the moment so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t hate it too much well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">how that&#39;s how it&#39;s been so successful</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">at separating this is it comes as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">trojan horse disguised as something</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">which is going to connect us</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">but actually it does the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">anyway sorry</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s other people want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">i i guess i can go um</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">i um it was interesting listening to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">because i i i wasn&#39;t gonna bring up</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">technology but i i can see how</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">um there there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">face for technology that that actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">and for me it would work in um</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">sustaining or facilitating that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">kind of deep connection that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">authenticity that i was talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">if it could do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">if it could if it could provide</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">the space for that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">really like authentic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">facilitate the trust that you need and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">and the kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">i think uh alex mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">just you&#39;re kind of the kind of real</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">authentic selves</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">making sure making sure um</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">allowing that to come through more</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">easily</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">so for me um the perfect world would</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">would be where that is the default the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">authentic</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:46.400" style="s2">vulnerable vulnerable self would be the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">default</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">from that a person could</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">much more easily discover their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">sense of meaning and connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:02.880" style="s2">you know they it would be it would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">reflected in</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.880" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">the dialogues that you had it would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">it would be like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">felt thing and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">it would be um strengthened</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">and reflected anyways that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">what i&#39;m feeling okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">i think i&#39;d agree with eric um on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:27.800" style="s2">and i think daniel and alex need to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">chipped with the bat signal</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.800" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">so beam a signal you know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">you need to be shifted to to put you</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">and they each put in ten dollars so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">we have a hundred thousand dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">to create something</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">all right i&#39;ve got i&#39;ve i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">this is this is this is basically how i</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">sort of imagine</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">we could do this because this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">something i&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">you know thought about how you could say</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">combat sort of facebook if</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">this is very kind of this this might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">kind of based around</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">you know using a technological aspect at</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">first um</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">but i but to me it looks that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">one of the main reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">facebook is able to to to make all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.720" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">understandings of us is by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:23.840" style="s2">we give it so much of our data that of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">course then</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">you know to be able to be useful it has</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">to then sell it to somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">who can then you know pair it with other</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.960" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">stuff to be able to bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">something that makes</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">this useful so that we can be be sold</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">better stuff so it&#39;s so it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">we need to be able to reverse that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">um we need to be able to actually like</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">own our own data</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">and have sovereignty over ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">online and how we act online and what it</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">what that what that algorithm knows</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">about us effectively</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">um for us to be able to actually you</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">know do anything that&#39;s that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">you know to be able to flip that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">model um because i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to give it up very</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">easily that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s why this time is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">quite interesting is because it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">of like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">the oil uh companies of the past</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:16.640" style="s2">when once you know they have no</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.640" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">to to move over to something that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">haven&#39;t already been</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">completely um you know created by</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">so in in that sense you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">going to be this this change</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">because if we do want if we if we agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">that those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">um that power that facebook has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">able to manipulate democracy or</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">you know uh um completely kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">our mindsets on stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">unless we&#39;re able to take that back and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">have have agency in how we use it</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">then um you know i think i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">always going to get into this</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">um into this issue we&#39;re never really</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">going to be able to use it</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">properly for ourselves so to to me i</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">think you know especially if you had</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">10 000 people um all of those 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">being able to create their own place</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">online where</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">all of their data is is centralized and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">it just tracks them everywhere they go</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">and they never have to click accept ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">again and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">they can just have this thing that knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">them so well</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">but as long as it&#39;s you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">this is this is where it kind of comes</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">the idea of security like if if we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">going to be our authentic selves and be</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">and have something that is very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">feels very intrusive</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">it needs to have that sense of security</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">and to me that&#39;s almost like the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">i think we all kind of need that need</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">some sense of security to feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">vulnerable so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">you know actually connect with one</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">another so that we can you know have</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">have community alex what is is your</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">background in tech</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">no yeah because i i feel and i&#39;m my</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">background&#39;s not in tech either but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">like my passion what i&#39;m trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">i feel like a repository for your data i</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">would love that and i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">feasible for a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">like i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">all right i mean like how would i get my</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">data from facebook and google when</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not even willing to give it if</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:09.919" style="s2">we had millions of dollars let alone for</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">like we what could we create with ten</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.399" end="00:31:14.799" style="s2">thousand people and a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:16.399" style="s2">dollars that we could use</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.799" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">right without needing to to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.399" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">permission from google or facebook</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">because i love that idea i want access</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">to my own data</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">but i don&#39;t to me i because i was like</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">if you know how to do that for a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">thousand dollars let&#39;s get on that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">call that right now</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">of these things from somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">and then we&#39;re able to to make them talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">to each other and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">create a kind of map and then that map</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">can also be kind of the thing is you you</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">need to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">a way for it to be um the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">insights to be able to generate it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">but you you need it so that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">sending it to a bunch of places it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">more that it has you know like an</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">access point um so i don&#39;t like yeah i</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">this human being because the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">for them is to be connected and happy</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">and healthy that they&#39;re like they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">is something it&#39;s just how would you do</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">but i think ten thousand people putting</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be trolls and therefore would</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">be show especially since they&#39;re putting</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">then they may be confused</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">sometimes and they have to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">figure it out and they spend the first</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">five minutes and they can&#39;t tell and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">then</p>

<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">would have a better expectations of the</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">there&#39;s the moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">by the way if i seem to be acting a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">oddly it&#39;s because i have this condition</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">that i mean vulnerability is risky but i</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:29.920" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s needed for better friendships</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.920" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">and vet and better</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">all the way right away uh because</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:51.520" style="s2">some people will hurt you back but</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">um yeah if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.520" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">the solution thing if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">network of you know where</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">trusted people because i do think trust</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">is a little bit transferable</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">yeah i totally i totally agree i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">by the fact that so much of everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">we do in life is is that anyway</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">in the way in which you know a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">are filled by</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">by recommendations because you know good</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:51.359" style="s2">people will who are who are high and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">who have a sort of um belief to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:54.640" style="s2">certain point or whatever will also be</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">hanging around other people or working</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">in similar situations so</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">when we we we do that anyway and i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">you know by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">people can sort of disappear from each</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">other and and have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">um have a kind of complete break that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">um that means that we almost are needing</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">solution of being able to vouch for</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">somebody else and go okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve developed a certain trust</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">with that person</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">um and i think if you had a network of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">10 000 people all just being able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">you know really show how much trust they</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:31.680" style="s2">had in</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">in somebody else um that would really</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">allow like so much more kind of fluid</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">kind of collaboration to work work</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">between them and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">um and it kind of kind of makes me feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">like having um you almost want like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:46.240" style="s2">like a manual</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:47.760" style="s2">of yourself that you know if we were</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.240" end="00:44:49.839" style="s2">gonna do it super slow</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.760" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">you you&#39;d sort of get to get to know</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.839" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">somebody before you almost meet them</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know how you would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">present that but</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">i think you know that&#39;s almost a way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">kind of get around</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">that that whole kind of on-boarding</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">people into your into your</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">uh personality so so what if you had</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:09.760" style="s2">i mean i i feel like on the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.760" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">there&#39;s these different types like i</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">like i could have a group of people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">i had great</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">conversations with this knowing</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:28.400" style="s2">piece but i still felt lonely because i</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">really want to go rock climbing with</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.400" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">someone and i just haven&#39;t found that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">person and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">or i have all these rock climbing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">friends but everybody&#39;s really shallow</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">i think like the thing we could probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">more practically concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">is having some kind of i i love the idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">like jubilee mentioned what if i did let</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">people know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">you can actually call me till like one</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">in the morning i&#39;m that type of person</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:00.400" style="s2">like i&#39;ll probably pick up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.119" style="s2">i&#39;ll probably be there for you but</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">people just don&#39;t know that they see</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">they see dan and they&#39;re like oh well</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">he&#39;s a working professional i probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">can&#39;t call him after nine like because</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">whatever but that&#39;d be cool to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">like that it just</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">i think one of the things we&#39;ve touched</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">on but not quite is like with loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">a lot of what can combat it is activity</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">right whether that activity is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">because that&#39;s where i get my deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">authentic connection from is by sharing</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">and finding learning about people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">seeing them but also the rock climbing</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">or the you know recovery or any of those</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:41.839" style="s2">things they&#39;re around an activity</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">so an event and having something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.839" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">meetup</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">but for online and offline events where</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:49.040" style="s2">curating your life right you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">hey i&#39;m really good</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">that that would be useful to curate your</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">dashboard of activity right to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">and if there&#39;s any obstacles</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">version right that like because we own</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">it and the point isn&#39;t to make money for</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">meetup the point is connection</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:28.960" style="s2">and so we&#39;re going to want each in</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.319" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">iteration to be um</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.960" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">better and meet our connection</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">loneliness needs more so than make money</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">for us right and that is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">technology cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">vision is that everything we create</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">together is for purpose not for profit</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">so if we&#39;re creating something to combat</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">people and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">continually improving it it&#39;s like what</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:53.359" style="s2">the first version and then how do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">continually improve it because</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.359" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">meetup exists but we don&#39;t own it and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">can&#39;t improve it and that&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">thing are we still going around doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">that what we would do for ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">dollars</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.160" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">hearing a lot of road noise or anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">um no okay it&#39;s a little quiet but nope</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">i i um i i liked a lot of what i was</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">hearing</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:54.559" style="s2">the the part i</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">i i was really impressed by holotape</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">um and in that it it can carry a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">that information</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">um it it can sense all the nodes around</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">that are close to it and it it can</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">um it carries like a it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">like blockchain on steroids because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">it can carry that ledger information off</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">everything you interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">up to that point or everything this</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">thing interacted with so</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">the idea of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">to know to have everything about you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:37.599" style="s2">in there and um</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">i guess it would be like offering how</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">would you say that</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">bids of information this is possibly</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">what i want</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">everyone to know within a certain trust</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:54.800" style="s2">circle and your trust</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">could be distributed i&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.800" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">and so people will know</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">all of that also if you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">probably build in with an algorithm an</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.079" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">uh to know those things that are on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">periphery of my knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">or my interest or things i might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:17.760" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">and then have it present opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.760" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">from the other interactive nodes or</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">nodes that just joined in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">in that group of 10 000 where the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">opportunities are</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s possible with 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">and and i think the fruits of that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:42.319" style="s2">that you would enable creative people to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">come up with things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.319" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">would blow others away and people</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">say where the fuck are these people</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">coming from you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">really where they get these ideas how</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">are they able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:52:00.480" style="s2">to do these things and then they</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">they point to that that that community</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.480" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">and i think that the fruit of that would</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">drive people to want to get in</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s only one way in you</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">got to be vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.000" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">you got to be totally vulnerable and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">got to be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s your way in</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">definitely down to last few minutes as</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">the part where we can go around and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">we never stop there um</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">and say what they you think is the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">powerful part of what you could do with</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:30.559" style="s2">people and a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">and carrie you&#39;re more than welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.559" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">start and or and then share you nah</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not gonna say no sorry you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">okay um</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">the most powerful one for me is one that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">includes it all</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">one that includes like how but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">information that i can give you so that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">i can show up and be vulnerable without</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">needing to constantly add all these tag</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">lines about like</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">my disability and my past and all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">this stuff would be very powerful for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">personally but also</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">within that a emergency button like</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">something that is like i need help</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">now and you just push it and something</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">goes out either your circle or random</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">strangers that like</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">in crisis because it&#39;s the time when</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">you&#39;re least able to do that for</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">yourself and when you most need it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">yeah i think um i was just i just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.520" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">to echo what um</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">what mark was saying because i think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">very aligned to to</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">to what that looks like um and i feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly that way of of us kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">forming</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.720" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">sort of new um new tribes and new kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">of partnerships with other people</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">on larger scales that will allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.280" end="00:53:41.520" style="s2">have some of that creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">innovation</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.520" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">that will be the kind of great attractor</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">um like daniel schweinsteiger always</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">talk about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">something like that would would would</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:55.200" style="s2">generate that by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">everyone is um you know able to really</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.200" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">leverage each other and actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">by going into partnership in the long</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:02.240" style="s2">term with people and and being</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:05.119" style="s2">vulnerable and improving</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.240" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">yourself and and in in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.119" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">um i think the the fruits of that could</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">be um</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">could be super exponential you know it</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">could be one of those things where if</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">you have that kind of community and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:20.319" style="s2">and it goes by</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">by like slowly um passing the trust</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.319" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">forward into a network um i think all</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">you really need is that like commitment</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">of those those</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">ten thousand or even less than that just</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">uh um</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">just to put it into into play so</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:37.440" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s and um</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">yeah and i just wanna also say that in</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">guess none of you really agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">because none of you picked up on it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">um but i i i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">connections to other people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">important yes but it&#39;s only part of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">you can have</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">good friendships in your life and still</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:53.200" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">purposeless or directionless or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.200" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">it might be and you know you can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">your friends about it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">actually alleviate the things so i i do</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">think i don&#39;t know the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">the a lack of connection to something</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">deep in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:09.760" style="s2">is something that cannot be assuaged</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.760" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">all the relationships in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">there you must also have that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">so yeah i don&#39;t know what i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">how that fits into the ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">people hundred thousand dollars i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:21.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really but i i</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:24.319" style="s2">it just seems to be a missing part of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.440" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">the conversation in general</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.319" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">all right i don&#39;t know who is shared</p>

<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">i think i picked up on like three or</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">four different</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">um semi-related ideas it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:48.720" style="s2">all all good i really like the jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">i guess i could echo what you said as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.720" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">practical thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">as some kind of business card</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:57.359" style="s2">maybe digital business card but not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">business card</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.359" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">uh i think that&#39;s i think that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:02.559" style="s2">cool um</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">so i i think it&#39;s just important to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">remember i think about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">there&#39;s the five love languages thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">and so we have a big danger of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:12.640" style="s2">projecting</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:14.559" style="s2">like i have the answer because i know</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.640" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">what connects me to people but</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.559" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">people are connected by different styles</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">um and so we&#39;ve got to remember it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:24.640" style="s2">different styles for different</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">people i connect by talking someone else</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.640" end="00:58:28.799" style="s2">connects</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">by uh doing you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.799" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">these best differences and on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">vulnerability thing so i</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">i agree with that i was just gonna share</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:43.520" style="s2">i learned that you know i&#39;m from the usa</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:46.799" style="s2">i learned that my father&#39;s generation</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.520" end="00:58:47.760" style="s2">was basically told vulnerability is</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.799" end="00:58:50.880" style="s2">weakness</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.760" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">vulnerability is the enemy and never</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.880" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">show your weakness because that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">make a man</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t and like i i&#39;m um</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:01.280" style="s2">very hopeful for our generation because</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:01.920" style="s2">i keep getting in conversations where</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.280" end="00:59:05.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.920" end="00:59:10.559" style="s2">seem to realize that&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.280" end="00:59:10.559" style="s2">the way um and that&#39;s makes me hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">anyone else like to share their most</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">powerful idea before we stop recording</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:21.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m watching tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">i guess i&#39;d like to just um</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.760" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">let eric know that he&#39;s not he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">alone with um</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.359" style="s2">feeling that meaning and revealing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">meaning in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.359" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">is is is important</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">um i i just think that um</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:42.319" style="s2">authentic dialogue and being present and</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:43.760" style="s2">sometimes just witnessing you know not</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.319" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">saying anything you could be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.760" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">one of a hundred witnesses but just</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:52.400" style="s2">witnessing with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:53.680" style="s2">can allow you to get some of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.400" end="00:59:54.720" style="s2">meaning and even give some of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.680" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.720" end="00:59:58.000" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s that&#39;s important but i</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.000" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">a lot of these ideas about scaling trust</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">how to scale that&#39;s critical we got to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:10.319" style="s2">figure that out</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:13.200" style="s2">we&#39;re looking here</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:17.119" style="s2">just just one thing on this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:18.799" style="s2">skating i mean i really like the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.119" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">the transferability of trust i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.799" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a really cool idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">however this is weaponizable right</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">because trust now becomes a commodity on</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:29.440" style="s2">this network right it&#39;s a valuable</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.920" style="s2">commodity and people will start</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.440" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">selling their trust to people oh you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.920" end="01:00:34.880" style="s2">give me a thousand quid and i&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">that i trust you a hundred percent and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.880" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2">then all the people that know me and</p>

<p begin="01:00:37.359" end="01:00:41.440" style="s2">they see my trust to this person which</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t actually real trust it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.440" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">bought</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:46.079" style="s2">you know what i mean and and so the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">network can easily become corrupted in</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.079" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">this manner</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s true and there&#39;s other ways it can</p>
