<p begin="00:00:00.299" end="00:00:05.700" style="s2">so thank you very much for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.429" end="00:00:08.010" style="s2">opportunity to to speak to y&#39;all as I</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:10.650" style="s2">mentioned like I&#39;m not feeling a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.010" end="00:00:13.019" style="s2">percents from my voice might be giving</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.650" end="00:00:16.949" style="s2">in but it&#39;s it&#39;s okay well well give it</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.019" end="00:00:19.350" style="s2">give it a try and I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.949" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">seeing all the questions I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.350" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">briefly whether I can share the screen</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">can people see me on a bigger screen or</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">oh okay then then I&#39;ll see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:32.340" style="s2">share one slide with you just because it</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.449" end="00:00:42.079" style="s2">helps to answer the the first question</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.340" end="00:00:42.079" style="s2">let me just see if this works this one</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.200" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">can you see the slide the graphic now</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.789" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">yeah okay the it&#39;s quite a dense graphic</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s a useful way of describing</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:57.809" style="s2">and contextualizing a little bit the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">first question which was how do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:03.750" style="s2">distinguish between regenerative design</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:05.970" style="s2">and sustainable design and you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.750" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">also call it regenerative development</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.970" end="00:01:12.780" style="s2">and sustainable development so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">graphic um is an evolution of a graphic</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">that I first saw bill read use in 2006</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">in an article called shifting our mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">models which if you put that into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.420" style="s2">search engine you should find the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:30.049" style="s2">original article and what I really liked</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.420" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">about it is that it puts on a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.049" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">the journey that that we now have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">make rapidly and and because it puts it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:42.290" style="s2">on the spectrum and the energy in it</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">depicts it as a journey it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.290" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">negate or dismiss any stage of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">journey it just says there is road ahead</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">and there is a as a larger goal and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">many ways you could summarize this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:02.460" style="s2">journey from that the conventional</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">businesses usual practice that that most</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.460" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">businesses and and most governments are</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">engaged in is basically to legislate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.349" style="s2">a certain extent what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:15.359" style="s2">environmental and social</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.349" end="00:02:16.709" style="s2">behavior is allowed and and what our</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.359" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">transgressions and create legal</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.709" end="00:02:23.159" style="s2">frameworks that keep people somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">within certain boundaries but of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.159" end="00:02:29.010" style="s2">we we know that those boundaries are</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:30.540" style="s2">still by and large degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.010" end="00:02:32.849" style="s2">and-and-and that there are structural</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.540" end="00:02:35.969" style="s2">problems with the system to a point that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.849" end="00:02:38.549" style="s2">we continued to degrade our communities</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.969" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">and our environment so the next step</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.549" end="00:02:43.859" style="s2">then from a perspective of a company</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:46.829" style="s2">would be to do a little bit more than</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.859" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">just stay within the legal limits use a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.829" end="00:02:54.599" style="s2">little bit more renewable energy maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">plant some bio diverse gardens around</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.599" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">the company&#39;s headquarters and all those</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:01.439" style="s2">kind of things and then over communicate</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:03.209" style="s2">it in in the marketing side of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.439" end="00:03:05.489" style="s2">company and that&#39;s often called green</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.209" end="00:03:08.489" style="s2">washing but but in many ways those</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.489" end="00:03:09.919" style="s2">little steps are steps and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.489" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be completely dismissed and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.919" end="00:03:16.109" style="s2">then in this framework the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:19.290" style="s2">sustainable is reserved for those things</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.109" end="00:03:24.030" style="s2">that don&#39;t add any more damage</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.290" end="00:03:26.609" style="s2">but in in many ways this neutral no</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.030" end="00:03:28.199" style="s2">impact not being part of the problem but</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.609" end="00:03:31.099" style="s2">also in a way not being part of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.199" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">solution is not enough anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.099" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">depending on where we start I like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:38.459" style="s2">actually start with with agriculture in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:41.069" style="s2">developing and the wrong type of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:44.489" style="s2">agriculture being practiced some 8,000</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.069" end="00:03:47.189" style="s2">years ago and through that a study is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.489" end="00:03:49.259" style="s2">starting to denude the forest the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.189" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">planet by cutting down forests which</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.259" end="00:03:53.609" style="s2">we&#39;ve cut on about half of the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:58.229" style="s2">forests in the last eight thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.609" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">um that kind of damage that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.229" end="00:04:02.849" style="s2">and in particular since the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:04.500" style="s2">Revolution over the last 250 years we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.849" end="00:04:08.099" style="s2">have done so much damage to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.500" end="00:04:10.199" style="s2">environment that simply doing no harm is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.099" end="00:04:12.479" style="s2">not enough and it&#39;s really the same also</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.199" end="00:04:16.169" style="s2">for social damage because particularly</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.479" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">with since colonialization and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.169" end="00:04:21.779" style="s2">second wave of sort of neo-colonial is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:23.940" style="s2">ssin in the form of neoliberal economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.779" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">expansion and globalization and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.940" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">we we have destroyed communities all</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:32.670" style="s2">around the globe or eroded social fabric</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:35.130" style="s2">and so we really need to do much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.670" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">than than just have low negative impact</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.130" end="00:04:42.600" style="s2">and then the next step on this spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">is called restorative and while it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.600" end="00:04:48.450" style="s2">already is trying to undo some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">damage underneath it says humans doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">things to nature so it&#39;s still done in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:57.870" style="s2">mindset that says okay let&#39;s bring the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:05:00.570" style="s2">Indian Army in and beat the world record</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.870" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">in how many trees we can plant in a day</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.570" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">which is wonderful to see that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:08.420" style="s2">can plant a million trees or more in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">single day if everybody works together</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.420" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t care for the trees</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:15.750" style="s2">afterwards then a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:18.540" style="s2">gardening and forestry knowledge will</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.750" end="00:05:20.370" style="s2">tell you that maybe one two maximum ten</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.540" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">percent of those trees would survive if</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.370" end="00:05:25.140" style="s2">you don&#39;t resource and engage the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">to take care of those million trees</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.140" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">they&#39;re planted so so these the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">restorative mindset does good things but</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">by still being in the mindset that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:39.930" style="s2">is has the human arrogance that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:42.810" style="s2">somehow are outside of nature and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.930" end="00:05:47.010" style="s2">we somehow have the right to to control</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.810" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2">manipulate and and and change the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.010" end="00:05:53.760" style="s2">than human nature patterns in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:56.690" style="s2">is still part of the problem and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.760" end="00:05:59.700" style="s2">real important step towards working</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.690" end="00:06:04.380" style="s2">regenerative Lee is to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.700" end="00:06:06.360" style="s2">as one of my compatriots good was more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.380" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">famous as as a literary man but he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.360" end="00:06:11.580" style="s2">also a scientist said over 200 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:14.100" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t see nature everywhere sees</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.580" end="00:06:16.530" style="s2">her nowhere in the right light who</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.100" end="00:06:19.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t see nature everywhere sees her</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.530" end="00:06:22.320" style="s2">nowhere in the right light and for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.200" end="00:06:23.880" style="s2">that&#39;s really an interesting invitation</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.320" end="00:06:27.320" style="s2">to start to think even about our</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.880" end="00:06:30.570" style="s2">technologies as part of the biophysical</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.320" end="00:06:33.390" style="s2">unity that is life as a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.570" end="00:06:36.630" style="s2">process and the biosphere transforming</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.390" end="00:06:37.380" style="s2">over millennia and an even longer time</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.630" end="00:06:41.490" style="s2">spans</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.380" end="00:06:44.640" style="s2">and it means that even our technologies</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.490" end="00:06:47.250" style="s2">even nuclear power plants are part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.640" end="00:06:50.180" style="s2">those natural cycles but in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.250" end="00:06:55.460" style="s2">they are maladaptive and they will not</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.180" end="00:06:58.500" style="s2">continue to give our species of future</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.460" end="00:07:00.090" style="s2">sorry there&#39;s a problem in back I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.500" end="00:07:06.920" style="s2">know if you can hear the the beeping and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.090" end="00:07:06.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just stopped okay so in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">sustainable design is still very</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:13.410" style="s2">important sustainability is still very</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.390" style="s2">important I think sustainability is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.410" end="00:07:19.140" style="s2">bridge that we haven&#39;t passed yet and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.390" end="00:07:22.020" style="s2">the danger in in what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.140" end="00:07:24.570" style="s2">now with so many people getting excited</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.020" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">about the regenerative impulse and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.570" end="00:07:30.450" style="s2">the the movement of regeneration all</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:32.550" style="s2">around the world is that many people who</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">look for the the newest trend will will</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.210" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">jump onto this regenerative term and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">added to whatever they&#39;re doing already</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">instead of sustainability and and start</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:50.070" style="s2">to discourse so if our sustainability is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">so old and not fashionable anymore</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.070" end="00:07:54.030" style="s2">everybody wants to be reset regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:55.080" style="s2">now but that&#39;s really not what this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.030" end="00:07:58.140" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.080" end="00:08:00.750" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really to honor that we still</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.140" end="00:08:04.380" style="s2">need to do a lot of work to become</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.750" end="00:08:07.320" style="s2">sustainable but to set the goal much</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.380" end="00:08:11.040" style="s2">further out and say actually as life we</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.320" end="00:08:14.220" style="s2">have the capacity to regenerate our</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.040" end="00:08:16.410" style="s2">communities regenerate local and by</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.220" end="00:08:20.490" style="s2">regional economies and regenerate the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.410" end="00:08:23.250" style="s2">ecosystems in which we live as part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.490" end="00:08:27.150" style="s2">those ecosystems so we start to design</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.250" end="00:08:30.360" style="s2">as nature rather than design or do</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.150" end="00:08:34.169" style="s2">things to nature and briefly I just want</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.360" end="00:08:38.610" style="s2">to point out like so I put the SDGs the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.169" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">the UN discourse on development or</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.610" end="00:08:42.539" style="s2">sustainable development right in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:45.450" style="s2">center here but I want to point out that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.539" end="00:08:48.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve slightly changed the SDG number-8</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.450" end="00:08:50.520" style="s2">icon um might if you look carefully you</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.630" end="00:08:54.209" style="s2">might see that there&#39;s a little spanner</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.520" end="00:08:57.630" style="s2">em on that icon now and I do that on</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.209" end="00:08:59.940" style="s2">purpose to highlight that in the current</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.630" end="00:09:04.020" style="s2">framing of the sustainable development</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.940" end="00:09:06.089" style="s2">goals within the goals is the sabotaging</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.020" end="00:09:08.700" style="s2">element that will stop us from</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.089" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">implementing all 17 goals and that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.700" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">the way that we&#39;re currently framing SDG</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:15.830" style="s2">number eight it&#39;s still called decent</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">work and continued economic growth and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.830" end="00:09:20.970" style="s2">the problem that has driven</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:24.330" style="s2">unsustainable or degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.970" end="00:09:29.089" style="s2">development is that structurally we</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.330" end="00:09:31.500" style="s2">designed a economic system that needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.089" end="00:09:35.370" style="s2">continued economic growth in order to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.500" end="00:09:38.730" style="s2">survive to continue and this growth</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:40.980" style="s2">imperative and the fundamental structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.730" end="00:09:43.770" style="s2">of the economic and monetary system that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.980" end="00:09:46.430" style="s2">is a zero sum game which needs losers</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.770" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">for other people&#39;s to be able to win is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.430" end="00:09:52.110" style="s2">a system that ultimately drives us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">exploit the planet and exploit each</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.110" end="00:09:57.959" style="s2">other and so there is a structurally</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:10:00.089" style="s2">this structural dysfunctionality in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.959" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">current economic and monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.089" end="00:10:07.170" style="s2">that unless we address that we will not</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:08.940" style="s2">be able to implement the seventeen SDGs</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.170" end="00:10:10.700" style="s2">and cross that bridge towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.940" end="00:10:14.820" style="s2">regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.700" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">that&#39;s at least my firm conviction so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.820" end="00:10:23.910" style="s2">and then just briefly some other changes</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:25.649" style="s2">that we need to make on the path towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.910" end="00:10:28.020" style="s2">working more regenerative leave you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.649" end="00:10:30.120" style="s2">see under on the left hand side it says</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.020" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">designing technical systems we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.120" end="00:10:35.370" style="s2">obsessed with mechanistic and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:38.180" style="s2">technological metaphors we even explain</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.370" end="00:10:41.850" style="s2">consciousness and the brain using</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.180" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">computers as an example and anybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.850" end="00:10:47.850" style="s2">who&#39;s ever seen a little baby grow up</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:49.980" style="s2">and will see that that biology is so</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.850" end="00:10:52.649" style="s2">much more clever than we are and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.980" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">there are so many more complex processes</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.649" end="00:10:57.899" style="s2">in in life unfolding that even our</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:59.790" style="s2">highest technology is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.899" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">quite simple and crude compared to what</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.790" end="00:11:07.439" style="s2">life is doing constantly</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:10.059" style="s2">and and so those technological and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.439" end="00:11:12.999" style="s2">mechanistic metaphors keep us in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.059" end="00:11:14.980" style="s2">of mindset that doesn&#39;t really help help</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.999" end="00:11:15.699" style="s2">us in creating truly regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.980" end="00:11:19.829" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.699" end="00:11:19.829" style="s2">similarly the the way that our</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:26.199" style="s2">intellectual landscape is fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.139" end="00:11:28.029" style="s2">into the different disciplines that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.199" end="00:11:30.939" style="s2">taught at universities and the different</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.029" end="00:11:33.819" style="s2">specialties that people become experts</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.939" end="00:11:36.809" style="s2">in and and then make their their</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.819" end="00:11:39.429" style="s2">financial income from then all of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.809" end="00:11:41.110" style="s2">has created a wealth of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.429" end="00:11:42.249" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not important and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.110" end="00:11:45.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we should completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.249" end="00:11:46.569" style="s2">dismiss all this but we need to put it</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.220" end="00:11:49.239" style="s2">in in its place and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.569" end="00:11:52.299" style="s2">understand that and with every</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.239" end="00:11:53.860" style="s2">perspective comes a blind-spot and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.299" end="00:11:56.290" style="s2">therefore we need to value multiple</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.860" end="00:11:58.029" style="s2">perspectives and and pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.290" end="00:12:00.809" style="s2">the blind spots of each one of them and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.029" end="00:12:05.439" style="s2">talk to each other to create more</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.809" end="00:12:07.660" style="s2">integrative solutions and it also be in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.439" end="00:12:10.230" style="s2">in a similar vein this since the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.660" end="00:12:13.179" style="s2">Scientific Revolution this focus on on</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.230" end="00:12:16.389" style="s2">mechanism and technology and science has</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.179" end="00:12:18.850" style="s2">brought in a way of seeing that if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.389" end="00:12:21.910" style="s2">can&#39;t quantify it it&#39;s not there I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.850" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">Galileo said this many many a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.910" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">centuries ago they did there two types</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:27.490" style="s2">of qualities the qualities you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:29.429" style="s2">measure and the qualities you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.490" end="00:12:32.139" style="s2">measure and he basically said science</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.429" end="00:12:34.839" style="s2">has to work with only the measurable</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.139" end="00:12:37.649" style="s2">which is basically what we&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.839" end="00:12:42.549" style="s2">what which we now call quantifiable</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.649" end="00:12:45.189" style="s2">indicators and so even as you like I see</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.549" end="00:12:47.230" style="s2">this when when I did at work when my</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.189" end="00:12:49.389" style="s2">book came out in in Brazil and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.230" end="00:12:51.269" style="s2">people in Brazil were asking so what are</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.389" end="00:12:53.939" style="s2">the indicators of success for</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.269" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">regenerative companies give me the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.939" end="00:12:57.819" style="s2">indicators I can work with as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:13:00.850" style="s2">consultant with companies and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.819" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">always pushing towards creating easily</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.850" end="00:13:04.809" style="s2">quantifiable indicators and they might</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:07.899" style="s2">give us an indication and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.809" end="00:13:09.579" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t find some but my point is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.899" end="00:13:12.069" style="s2">that really we need to pay much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.579" end="00:13:14.410" style="s2">attention about qualities to qualities</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.069" end="00:13:16.680" style="s2">because when you engage in regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.410" end="00:13:19.410" style="s2">practice in communities</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.680" end="00:13:21.750" style="s2">it is the qualitative changes of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.410" end="00:13:23.610" style="s2">relationships between people between</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.750" end="00:13:25.980" style="s2">people and their environment between</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.610" end="00:13:30.510" style="s2">people in their ecosystem and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.980" end="00:13:33.510" style="s2">really matter and yes to some extent we</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.510" end="00:13:36.029" style="s2">can find proxies that are quantifiable</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.510" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">that express these qualitative changes</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.029" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s always something important</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:43.709" style="s2">that is lost so really working</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:47.570" style="s2">regenerative lis is understanding</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.709" end="00:13:50.459" style="s2">embracing our uncertainty embracing our</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.570" end="00:13:52.470" style="s2">inability to predict and control the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.459" end="00:13:55.470" style="s2">complexity of natural systems that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.470" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">are part of and to shift from this this</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.470" end="00:13:59.790" style="s2">control and manipulation mindset to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:02.700" style="s2">mindset of appropriate participation in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.790" end="00:14:05.010" style="s2">these patterns and and it&#39;s also a shift</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.700" end="00:14:07.589" style="s2">from this fragmented thinking of of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.010" end="00:14:10.740" style="s2">the expert which can be valued and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.589" end="00:14:12.839" style="s2">listened to to a more integrative</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.740" end="00:14:16.589" style="s2">thinking that also values the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.839" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">capabilities of generalists and people</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.589" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">who synthesized as well wealth of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:24.209" style="s2">knowledge we created and and really find</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:27.510" style="s2">solutions that serve all of humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.209" end="00:14:29.730" style="s2">serve all of life because ultimately one</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.510" end="00:14:32.339" style="s2">of these fragmented habits with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.730" end="00:14:39.020" style="s2">that made us see the world we see it now</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.339" end="00:14:41.070" style="s2">is paying attention to life as a a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.020" end="00:14:42.900" style="s2">collection of individuals and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.070" end="00:14:45.570" style="s2">collection of species somehow fighting</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.900" end="00:14:47.880" style="s2">against each other but but if you shift</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.570" end="00:14:50.070" style="s2">perspective and look at the planet as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.880" end="00:14:51.870" style="s2">whole then very quickly you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.070" end="00:14:53.850" style="s2">understand that life is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.870" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">planetary process and that in the</p>
