<p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">matters to them and I&#39;m hoping that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t this what is currently on all the</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">this debate instead of connection and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.250" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">that just that just having a place for</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">humanity to connect helps improve the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.190" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">worlds in a big way and then I have huge</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:49.620" style="s2">plans going from that once we get that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">platform going but that&#39;s that&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">number number one so thank you all for</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:57.329" style="s2">joining me today&#39;s question because we</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">round a question is how has your autism</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.329" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">diagnosis impacted your life we each</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">take up to 5 minutes so I&#39;ll kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">like flash 5 on the screen when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">gotten to 5 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">ish and then you can finish up your</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">thought and then or if you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">before that you are absolutely welcome</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">to be done before that and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.549" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">kind of have a brief open discussion for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">the remainder of the house an hour after</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2">that was done and I&#39;ll mute the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">two people that aren&#39;t speaking during</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">the five minutes so would anyone like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">start well for me it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">bright so I&#39;m sort of self diagnosed um</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">I I did have a therapist I saw as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">teenager who had written down that I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.570" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">probably on the spectrum but that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">never followed through those my mum I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">guess either didn&#39;t think to ask what</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">was going on or knew and then took me</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">out of therapy and just didn&#39;t tell me</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">so that was a that was I guess when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">could have found out 20 years ago um but</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">then I I got a career working in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">field of autism work in schools and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">realized probably about four or five</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">years ago that I was connecting better</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">to the students they worked with then my</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">my co-workers like who that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:15.570" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">being in the field I also knew what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.570" end="00:02:19.800" style="s2">current DSM at the time said for</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">diagnostic stuff and I was like well I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:25.050" style="s2">don&#39;t that um but then as I did more</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">research because that&#39;s what I do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.050" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">discovered that that what their I</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:29.790" style="s2">unfortunately is called the female</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">phenotype I don&#39;t really like that name</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.790" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">but it fit me so well and so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:36.030" style="s2">went back to the therapist ahead as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">teenager and I was like hey these is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">going on and she&#39;s like yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:42.420" style="s2">actually wrote that down 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.040" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">okay and I mentioned it to some</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.420" end="00:02:46.770" style="s2">co-workers who&#39;d been in the field and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">one of my friends who&#39;s been an autism</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.770" end="00:02:51.330" style="s2">support worker for like 25 years I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">messaged her and I was like you think he</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.330" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">might be autistic and her response was</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">to laugh in the friendliest of ways and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:03:01.650" style="s2">say yeah of course you are so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.810" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">that&#39;s how I found out and when I found</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.650" end="00:03:05.430" style="s2">that out and kind of came to terms with</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">that I realized that it gave me two</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.430" end="00:03:10.020" style="s2">things that I really didn&#39;t have before</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">it gave me a reason for so much of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.020" end="00:03:13.830" style="s2">had been going on a reason why I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">felt so different and they tell kids all</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.830" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">the time you all feel different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">totally normal but it&#39;s different when</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">you are different and the world treats</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:24.510" style="s2">you like you&#39;re drastically different it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:27.690" style="s2">is not the same as a kid who feels</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.510" end="00:03:29.850" style="s2">different um and it didn&#39;t matter what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.690" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">did I was always out of groups I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.850" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">always not quite fitting I was it just</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a place for me in the world um</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:36.780" style="s2">and I was a bigger target for abuse and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">bullying than a lot of the people around</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.780" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">me even as an adult I could be in a room</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:44.610" style="s2">and if there&#39;s an abuser or a bully in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:46.980" style="s2">the room almost always I will be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.610" end="00:03:49.410" style="s2">first one they target whether they know</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.980" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">me or not and it&#39;s taken a long time to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.410" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">understand that it&#39;s because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.030" end="00:03:54.299" style="s2">different and when you&#39;re different you</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:56.730" style="s2">can unearth and when people there police</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.299" end="00:03:59.100" style="s2">the people who are different are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.730" end="00:04:01.769" style="s2">people they&#39;ll attack first often so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.100" end="00:04:05.070" style="s2">having that um the reason has really</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.769" end="00:04:06.420" style="s2">helped me feel just better about it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.070" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">like there&#39;s somewhere I can do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.420" end="00:04:09.930" style="s2">something you can do with this somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">I can go with this I&#39;m not just sitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.930" end="00:04:14.579" style="s2">there floundering around going um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">part of that is that it&#39;s brought a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.579" end="00:04:18.209" style="s2">community I never felt like I fit</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">anywhere in my family with friends with</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.209" end="00:04:22.289" style="s2">anywhere and until this and I joined</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:24.090" style="s2">Facebook groups and I talked to people</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.289" end="00:04:25.979" style="s2">like you guys and I realized that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.090" end="00:04:27.750" style="s2">is a whole lot of people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.979" end="00:04:29.790" style="s2">very much like me</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.750" end="00:04:32.280" style="s2">who communicate like me who understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.790" end="00:04:35.300" style="s2">things like me who I can feel safe being</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.280" end="00:04:38.460" style="s2">me with which is very very rare for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.300" end="00:04:40.680" style="s2">and these people have brought support</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.460" end="00:04:43.140" style="s2">some of the most compassionate people in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.680" end="00:04:46.410" style="s2">the world and we share knowledge and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.140" end="00:04:48.840" style="s2">share ideas um and it&#39;s people who I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.410" end="00:04:50.730" style="s2">just feel very safe with which for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.840" end="00:04:55.650" style="s2">feeling safe with people is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.730" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">difficult things uh vines um and one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.650" end="00:04:59.640" style="s2">the things is I think because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:01.740" style="s2">bit of a different language we might</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.640" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">speak English just like my family speaks</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.740" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">English but I speak it differently I use</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">it differently and that&#39;s not often</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:10.710" style="s2">understood um and there&#39;s like a quote</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:12.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve been reading I don&#39;t know where you</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.710" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">guys live I live in Canada and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.150" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">going through an election process right</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">now so I read up on the different</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">parties all of them you know hoots to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:21.450" style="s2">fair but one of them has written a book</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:25.020" style="s2">recently and there&#39;s a quote in it that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.450" end="00:05:27.390" style="s2">I thought really fit with how I work</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.020" end="00:05:29.130" style="s2">language and he said of it&#39;s dead meet</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.390" end="00:05:31.380" style="s2">Doug meet Singh who&#39;s in the NDP party</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.130" end="00:05:33.450" style="s2">and he said I truly believe you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.380" end="00:05:34.919" style="s2">never fully connect to someone unless</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.450" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">you speak the language they grew up</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.919" end="00:05:39.270" style="s2">speaking the language they dream in if</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.080" end="00:05:41.130" style="s2">you love someone&#39;s language truly love</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.270" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">it then you can find a door to their</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.130" end="00:05:45.630" style="s2">culture identity and what makes them who</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.560" end="00:05:49.260" style="s2">they are and I think that that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.630" end="00:05:51.450" style="s2">very hard for me to find because I use</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.590" end="00:07:38.370" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like I spent 34 years</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.870" end="00:07:42.729" style="s2">taking care of the needs desires and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.370" end="00:07:44.740" style="s2">completely like nonsensical impulses of</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.729" end="00:07:59.229" style="s2">could not see it I was I had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.349" end="00:08:01.300" style="s2">ablest advice I recognized once I</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">realized that I myself was autistic I</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.300" end="00:08:06.580" style="s2">realized that I was devoting a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:09.070" style="s2">non-trivial amount of effort to looking</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:10.900" style="s2">down on other people that were autistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.070" end="00:08:14.169" style="s2">but that weren&#39;t masking the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.900" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">was and like I&#39;m not a person who looks</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.169" end="00:08:17.380" style="s2">down on people and that always made me</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:20.380" style="s2">uncomfortable and I couldn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.380" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">what was going on and it wasn&#39;t until I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.380" end="00:08:27.849" style="s2">finally realized like oh I hate myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">and I&#39;m projecting that onto people that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.849" end="00:08:35.110" style="s2">I see that remind me of the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:39.430" style="s2">myself that I can&#39;t accept and holy</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.110" end="00:08:43.970" style="s2">right like how do you get to that point</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.430" end="00:08:45.830" style="s2">like I until I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.970" end="00:08:47.720" style="s2">stood that I was autistic I had no</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.830" end="00:08:49.280" style="s2">framework to understand the primary</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.720" end="00:08:53.290" style="s2">mechanism through which I related to</p>

<p begin="00:08:53.290" end="00:08:59.930" style="s2">getting those answers allowed me to tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.940" end="00:09:01.430" style="s2">myself a story of Who I am that made</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.930" end="00:09:08.330" style="s2">sense for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.430" end="00:09:10.130" style="s2">I can&#39;t even articulate to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.330" end="00:09:12.590" style="s2">who&#39;s never had that experience like</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.130" end="00:09:16.790" style="s2">could you imagine being 34 years old and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.590" end="00:09:20.120" style="s2">like realizing that you&#39;re not who you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.790" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">thought you weren&#39;t like you&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.120" end="00:09:23.750" style="s2">your whole life like feeling a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:25.640" style="s2">bit a little bit off a little bit wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.750" end="00:09:28.700" style="s2">like things things never quite add up</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.640" end="00:09:30.890" style="s2">and then you get this answer and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:32.810" style="s2">answer is something that you&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.890" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">been exposed to before in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.810" end="00:09:37.660" style="s2">bounced right off of it because the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:39.020" style="s2">the answer was presented to you is</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.660" end="00:09:44.380" style="s2">pathologized</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.020" end="00:09:44.380" style="s2">and described in language that like</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.410" end="00:09:49.130" style="s2">being autistic is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.790" end="00:09:51.470" style="s2">subjective experience but when you read</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.130" end="00:09:53.180" style="s2">about like DSM criteria or like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.470" end="00:09:55.150" style="s2">other people described or even like</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.180" end="00:10:05.590" style="s2">doctors who are like ostensibly experts</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.150" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all behavioral and so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.590" end="00:10:09.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:11.770" style="s2">I think of us as an invisible dinosaur I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.160" end="00:10:14.440" style="s2">think of us as like we are a people we</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.770" end="00:10:16.779" style="s2">have always been a people we have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.440" end="00:10:19.750" style="s2">culture that is a natural culture that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.779" end="00:10:24.779" style="s2">emerges when we are together and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.750" end="00:10:27.160" style="s2">spent thousands of years like trapped</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.779" end="00:10:28.870" style="s2">each of us alone each of us not</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.160" end="00:10:30.250" style="s2">understanding or seeing that the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.870" end="00:10:33.520" style="s2">ones are out there and we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.250" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">through a cultural moment where we as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.520" end="00:10:37.330" style="s2">group are defining our own cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:39.790" style="s2">identity for kind of the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.330" end="00:10:41.560" style="s2">history and the connections that I feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.790" end="00:10:43.870" style="s2">the other autistic people people like me</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.560" end="00:10:45.070" style="s2">are things that I don&#39;t know I went I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.870" end="00:10:47.140" style="s2">went three decades of my life without</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.070" end="00:10:51.790" style="s2">ever really being able to have that kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.140" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">of a connection and that does things to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.790" end="00:10:55.810" style="s2">you because humans are social animals</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:58.300" style="s2">and your well-being as a social animal</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.810" end="00:11:00.760" style="s2">is contingent like on social integration</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.300" end="00:11:03.010" style="s2">and knowing who you are and being seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.760" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">and accepted and understood by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.010" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">people around you and if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:10.140" style="s2">that then you&#39;re not going to be okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:13.900" style="s2">and for me realizing I was autistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.140" end="00:11:16.570" style="s2">finally gave me the tools try to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.900" end="00:11:17.580" style="s2">that and it&#39;s it&#39;s completely changed my</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.110" end="00:11:57.700" style="s2">journey to self diagnosis was a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.000" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">strange one I grew up knowing I was a DD</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.700" end="00:12:03.100" style="s2">and as an adult I went in to get some</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:06.700" style="s2">AED meds because I I&#39;m kind of anti</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.100" end="00:12:08.290" style="s2">prescription for myself and the doctor I</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.700" end="00:12:09.880" style="s2">had at the time was like well we have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.290" end="00:12:11.260" style="s2">read iagnosed you which was a weird</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.880" end="00:12:12.790" style="s2">feeling so I&#39;m like you&#39;re taking away a</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.500" end="00:12:22.340" style="s2">checklists there was one that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.540" end="00:12:26.030" style="s2">was like weird I&#39;m like well I&#39;m all of</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.030" end="00:12:31.520" style="s2">was an autism checklist and then I</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:34.280" style="s2">looked at more of the like female parts</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.730" end="00:12:43.820" style="s2">because of course a formal diagnosis of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.110" end="00:12:48.260" style="s2">autism is much harder than a formal</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.820" end="00:12:52.030" style="s2">diagnosis of a DD and actually the the</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.720" end="00:13:31.190" style="s2">neurodivergent minds that both is partly</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.210" end="00:13:34.250" style="s2">what I grew up knowing was different</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.190" end="00:13:36.650" style="s2">EDD what I grew up with not knowing was</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.250" end="00:13:38.960" style="s2">different which was autism and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.650" end="00:13:44.410" style="s2">actual change in my brain that happened</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.960" end="00:13:46.910" style="s2">that gives me so much perspective but on</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.410" end="00:13:50.090" style="s2">the diversity that our brains are on</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.910" end="00:13:51.800" style="s2">this planet and what that gives us not</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.090" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">just as individuals but as a society</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.800" end="00:13:57.170" style="s2">that like that is what we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:13:58.960" style="s2">to have different Minds thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.170" end="00:14:02.120" style="s2">different ways and yet at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.960" end="00:14:05.390" style="s2">we only have access to one window to see</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.120" end="00:14:07.070" style="s2">the world from our own brain and so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.390" end="00:14:08.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we&#39;re different or the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.070" end="00:14:10.550" style="s2">same and that&#39;s including the hope in</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.900" end="00:14:12.710" style="s2">their own typical people like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.550" end="00:14:14.570" style="s2">know because you only have one to view</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.710" end="00:14:18.680" style="s2">so we view out into the world and see</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.570" end="00:14:21.770" style="s2">the world from the reflection of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.680" end="00:14:23.420" style="s2">window and we can&#39;t understand what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.770" end="00:14:25.940" style="s2">like to live in anyone else&#39;s shoes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.420" end="00:14:29.660" style="s2">I think that&#39;s one of the blessings of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.940" end="00:14:31.940" style="s2">autism is being autistic and meeting</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.660" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">other autistic people we know no two</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.940" end="00:14:36.360" style="s2">autistic people are this</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:38.100" style="s2">even though were that same culture that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.360" end="00:14:41.009" style="s2">those same were like we found our people</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.100" end="00:14:43.139" style="s2">and yet were not the same and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.009" end="00:14:47.250" style="s2">neurotypicals can maybe learn a lot from</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.139" end="00:14:48.660" style="s2">that and that I can see I have my own</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.250" end="00:14:50.699" style="s2">vision on how we can create a better</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.660" end="00:14:53.180" style="s2">world that I am actively working towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.699" end="00:14:57.000" style="s2">the idea Cafe is a big part of that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.180" end="00:14:58.620" style="s2">I can see how our diversity not just our</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.000" end="00:15:00.810" style="s2">neurodiversity but also our physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.620" end="00:15:02.250" style="s2">diversity or emotional diversity just</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.810" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">that we have different talents and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.250" end="00:15:06.660" style="s2">challenges is a big piece of how we</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:09.389" style="s2">create a better world together easily</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.660" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">and effectively once we like tap into</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.389" end="00:15:12.810" style="s2">that if the print if like we can find</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:15.630" style="s2">enough people who are willing to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.810" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">over their ableism in all areas then we</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.630" end="00:15:21.089" style="s2">can move forward creating a system that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:24.779" style="s2">like taps into that taps into our flow</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.089" end="00:15:26.490" style="s2">taps into what each of us is here to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.779" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">and so the I&#39;m not even answering the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.490" end="00:15:30.509" style="s2">question the impact on my life has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:34.290" style="s2">huge because it clicked a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.509" end="00:15:35.970" style="s2">into being and I actually already kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.290" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">of before even figuring out and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.970" end="00:15:39.930" style="s2">self-diagnose seen I had kind of gotten</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">over a lot of the that society puts</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.930" end="00:15:45.180" style="s2">on you about autism I had kind of gotten</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:46.709" style="s2">rid of a lot of my mask it&#39;s still I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.180" end="00:15:48.630" style="s2">still uncovering pieces of it because</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.709" end="00:15:50.639" style="s2">it&#39;s like put in place from from really</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.630" end="00:15:52.470" style="s2">young and there&#39;s and like allowing</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.639" end="00:15:54.089" style="s2">myself to kind of have meltdowns and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.470" end="00:15:56.670" style="s2">feeling what that&#39;s like and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.089" end="00:15:59.610" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to be in that body and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.670" end="00:16:01.230" style="s2">like letting go of what society has put</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.610" end="00:16:02.970" style="s2">on me is like this is what you do and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.230" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">this is what you have to be because</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.970" end="00:16:08.009" style="s2">there is so much more under that that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:09.480" style="s2">have to give and I think that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.009" end="00:16:11.550" style="s2">think I&#39;m unique I don&#39;t think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.480" end="00:16:14.939" style="s2">special in that regard I think all of us</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.550" end="00:16:17.670" style="s2">have something amazing underneath our</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.939" end="00:16:20.220" style="s2">masks and that includes neurotypical</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.670" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">people like we&#39;re all forced to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.220" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">certain way in society our gender our</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:29.910" style="s2">race our class our you know everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:33.180" style="s2">and when we go underneath that ego but</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.910" end="00:16:35.699" style="s2">Who am I that is like where the magic is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.180" end="00:16:37.500" style="s2">and if you have two paths and society</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.699" end="00:16:40.050" style="s2">says one and your soul your whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.500" end="00:16:41.850" style="s2">your essence says another you should</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:44.819" style="s2">always be following your essence but</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.850" end="00:16:46.950" style="s2">most of us follow Society and I think as</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.819" end="00:16:48.570" style="s2">an autistic person I look at one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.950" end="00:16:52.520" style="s2">other ways I knew I was autistic was</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.570" end="00:16:52.520" style="s2">credit throneburg I was like she&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.850" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like I was I was like her when I</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.980" end="00:17:00.930" style="s2">was little and like exact like no one</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:04.410" style="s2">else would be doing the climate March</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.930" end="00:17:08.209" style="s2">not at that in the 80s but like that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.410" end="00:17:11.670" style="s2">me and there is a powerful force there</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.209" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">that we need on this planet for us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.670" end="00:17:16.680" style="s2">burn much I think we&#39;re once we get over</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.980" end="00:17:19.680" style="s2">a mask once we get we get who we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.680" end="00:17:20.730" style="s2">we&#39;re more easily able to say like eff</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.680" end="00:17:23.670" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.730" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">I&#39;m here to forge my own path and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.670" end="00:17:27.959" style="s2">it&#39;s had a big impact on me and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:30.510" style="s2">world and sorry my five everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.959" end="00:17:39.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like a society my six-year-old okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.510" end="00:17:41.880" style="s2">all right that&#39;s my five minutes we both</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.960" end="00:17:43.920" style="s2">brought up sort of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.880" end="00:17:47.330" style="s2">quote-unquote like female presenting</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.920" end="00:17:49.860" style="s2">autism female phenotype of autism which</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.330" end="00:17:53.940" style="s2">can I agree with you that the wording is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.860" end="00:17:55.590" style="s2">horrible because it I have that</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.940" end="00:17:57.630" style="s2">presentation of autism</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:18:01.050" style="s2">I relate much more strongly to female</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.630" end="00:18:04.110" style="s2">presentation I was masking from a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.050" end="00:18:09.810" style="s2">young age I grew up multilingual I grew</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.110" end="00:18:11.640" style="s2">up like learning to present to you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.810" end="00:18:13.620" style="s2">I recently got a formal diagnosis or</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.640" end="00:18:16.020" style="s2">formal confirmation of my self diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.620" end="00:18:17.400" style="s2">and something that the diagnostician</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.020" end="00:18:19.950" style="s2">told me was that I was a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.400" end="00:18:22.730" style="s2">circumstantial person which was an</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.950" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">expression I&#39;d never heard before</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.730" end="00:18:27.210" style="s2">thought that made me feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:31.070" style="s2">inadmissible in court or something but</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.210" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">it turns out that that just means that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.070" end="00:18:35.310" style="s2">in her judgment it was somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:37.080" style="s2">behaved appropriately to the context in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.310" end="00:18:40.170" style="s2">which I find myself and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.080" end="00:18:42.360" style="s2">obviously that was my entire identity</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.170" end="00:18:45.150" style="s2">for most of my life so yeah I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.360" end="00:18:47.220" style="s2">good at that part it&#39;s the context where</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.150" end="00:18:49.740" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody around and I just need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.220" end="00:18:53.400" style="s2">be with myself and be okay that has</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.740" end="00:18:56.040" style="s2">caused me trouble because I know you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.400" end="00:18:57.960" style="s2">know when when you are habituated into</p>

<p begin="00:19:36.120" end="00:19:38.820" style="s2">one of the Facebook group someone had</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.380" end="00:19:42.140" style="s2">said that they were like flapping their</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.520" end="00:20:08.399" style="s2">better to be able to to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.919" end="00:20:09.750" style="s2">allow it in my body wherever I am but</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.399" end="00:20:10.890" style="s2">then there&#39;s time so I&#39;m like this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.750" end="00:20:15.330" style="s2">not appropriate you&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.890" end="00:20:18.750" style="s2">be doing this yeah well and I find it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.330" end="00:20:20.549" style="s2">been a journey because for me I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.750" end="00:20:22.830" style="s2">had always had some stems but I was also</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.549" end="00:20:26.549" style="s2">grew up um like I had an abusive</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.830" end="00:20:28.770" style="s2">childhood and I was not in my body</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.549" end="00:20:31.350" style="s2">essentially I was pretty dissociated my</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.770" end="00:20:33.419" style="s2">entire life until relatively recently is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.350" end="00:20:36.179" style="s2">the last two years I had a major</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.419" end="00:20:37.289" style="s2">autistic burnout and breakdown um</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.179" end="00:20:39.659" style="s2">because I had to deal with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.289" end="00:20:41.789" style="s2">developmental trauma disorder and so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.659" end="00:20:44.460" style="s2">last two years has been me figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.789" end="00:20:46.440" style="s2">okay what&#39;s an autism thing and what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.460" end="00:20:47.909" style="s2">trauma thing and I didn&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.440" end="00:20:49.559" style="s2">the autism things I&#39;m like that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.909" end="00:20:50.899" style="s2">time and figuring it out and I can do</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.559" end="00:20:52.830" style="s2">that I mean my whole career has been</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.899" end="00:20:54.919" style="s2">helping kids figure that out in</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.830" end="00:20:57.750" style="s2">themselves I can do that to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.919" end="00:21:00.929" style="s2">figuring out what&#39;s a trauma thing which</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.750" end="00:21:03.690" style="s2">does need to be like resolved and not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.929" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">thing and and stimming was something</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.690" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">that was an interesting journey to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:09.960" style="s2">figure out I&#39;m still doing it to figure</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:11.370" style="s2">out what makes me feel good and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.960" end="00:21:13.020" style="s2">do a lot of work I guess it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.370" end="00:21:14.870" style="s2">alexithymia when you&#39;re not really aware</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.020" end="00:21:17.580" style="s2">of your own sensations and I had</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.870" end="00:21:20.910" style="s2">but probably because of both of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.580" end="00:21:22.920" style="s2">things and so I&#39;ve done a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.910" end="00:21:25.260" style="s2">with somatic stuff and trying to just</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.920" end="00:21:27.270" style="s2">recognize how does my body feel when I</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.260" end="00:21:29.130" style="s2">do this is this better is this worse and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.270" end="00:21:30.660" style="s2">in doing that I have been able to figure</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.130" end="00:21:32.760" style="s2">out that there are certain stems that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.660" end="00:21:36.750" style="s2">really feel like I can probably see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.760" end="00:21:38.250" style="s2">soyang a little bit and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.750" end="00:21:41.910" style="s2">think many of mine are particularly</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.250" end="00:21:44.280" style="s2">overt but I&#39;ve it&#39;s been a process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.910" end="00:21:45.900" style="s2">being like okay I&#39;m in public and I used</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.280" end="00:21:47.130" style="s2">to I guess put on headphones I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.900" end="00:21:48.360" style="s2">even be listening to music but I could</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.130" end="00:21:49.740" style="s2">sway on the street and the headphones</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.360" end="00:21:52.230" style="s2">and people just assumed I was listening</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.740" end="00:21:53.730" style="s2">to music and then it dawned on me I</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.230" end="00:21:59.670" style="s2">don&#39;t have any music on when I do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.730" end="00:22:01.800" style="s2">that&#39;s just me I just realized while you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.670" end="00:22:04.550" style="s2">were talking cat like I have it I have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.800" end="00:22:07.140" style="s2">six-year-old that when she was an infant</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.550" end="00:22:09.210" style="s2">she would be on me and I would be like</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.140" end="00:22:12.450" style="s2">swaying constantly and even when she was</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.210" end="00:22:13.920" style="s2">off of me I would be swaying like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.450" end="00:22:15.900" style="s2">amount I was like oh this feels good</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.920" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">tonight that was long before I&#39;m only</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.900" end="00:22:22.410" style="s2">connecting the two now and every time I</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:24.150" style="s2">hold a baby it&#39;s like automatic like</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.410" end="00:22:30.600" style="s2">that is what we do with babies and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.150" end="00:22:32.460" style="s2">so calming and why is it typical person</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.600" end="00:22:34.740" style="s2">would find it calming and I mean they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.460" end="00:22:37.260" style="s2">shown that if you&#39;re doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.740" end="00:22:38.940" style="s2">trauma stuff even like a swinging motion</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.260" end="00:22:41.070" style="s2">a rocking motion people in boats</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.940" end="00:22:44.730" style="s2">wonderful for the rocking motion is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.070" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">I think a very human comforting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.730" end="00:22:51.390" style="s2">maybe just like the EMDR I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:53.040" style="s2">a lot of trauma therapy - it&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.390" end="00:22:55.260" style="s2">thing that has like really helped me I</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.040" end="00:22:58.620" style="s2">spend a lot of time doing like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.260" end="00:23:01.800" style="s2">do CBT you know where they teach you to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.620" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">ignore you&#39;re not engaged with your</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.800" end="00:23:05.790" style="s2">negative thoughts you know and what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.620" style="s2">kind of discovered is that a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.790" end="00:23:10.350" style="s2">negative thoughts were mic means</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.620" end="00:23:12.690" style="s2">screaming out to be met you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.350" end="00:23:15.710" style="s2">using CBT to ignore that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.690" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">not helping me me neither</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.710" end="00:23:23.400" style="s2">the semantics are so have you read about</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:25.490" style="s2">polyvagal theory Nick Fergus poor</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.400" end="00:23:28.030" style="s2">disappoint you I&#39;m gonna write that down</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.490" end="00:23:31.540" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.030" end="00:23:34.060" style="s2">he&#39;s been doing research for decades I</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.540" end="00:23:37.000" style="s2">guess and his he has like a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.060" end="00:23:38.620" style="s2">different model of like threat detection</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.000" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">and anxiety and depressions and these</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.620" end="00:23:44.290" style="s2">things he basically says traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">we think of safety as a property of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.290" end="00:23:51.100" style="s2">environment right and we like try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:53.410" style="s2">make the environment safe but actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.100" end="00:23:55.900" style="s2">you know and so we think about like</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.410" end="00:24:00.970" style="s2">trying to remove risks right we remove</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.900" end="00:24:02.590" style="s2">dangers he says polyvagal theory says</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.970" end="00:24:04.780" style="s2">basically like look lizards</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.590" end="00:24:07.780" style="s2">you know our lizard brain doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.780" end="00:24:10.180" style="s2">any social anything its relation to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.780" end="00:24:13.050" style="s2">other entities is like are you my dinner</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.180" end="00:24:15.130" style="s2">or am i your dinner or neither right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.050" end="00:24:17.140" style="s2">mammals come around and they&#39;re social</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.130" end="00:24:20.020" style="s2">they need to like raise each other right</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.140" end="00:24:21.580" style="s2">they need to like collaborate and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.020" end="00:24:25.240" style="s2">they needed some way to shut down</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.580" end="00:24:26.770" style="s2">actually the lizard brain and polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.240" end="00:24:29.680" style="s2">theory says that it&#39;s not the case that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.770" end="00:24:31.540" style="s2">mammals sometimes feel danger it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.680" end="00:24:34.510" style="s2">case that mammals are the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.540" end="00:24:37.000" style="s2">capable of feeling safety when you feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.510" end="00:24:39.640" style="s2">safe that is an override on your lizard</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:42.310" style="s2">brain and to the extent that you do not</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.640" end="00:24:43.780" style="s2">feel safe your brain is delegating</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.310" end="00:24:45.310" style="s2">responsibility to the lizard brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.780" end="00:24:50.560" style="s2">because the mammal brain is and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.310" end="00:24:52.750" style="s2">don&#39;t have access to it and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.560" end="00:24:56.050" style="s2">completely different way to like look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.750" end="00:24:58.090" style="s2">trauma because it&#39;s you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.050" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">this word trauma that means so many</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.090" end="00:25:01.300" style="s2">things to so many people it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:03.610" style="s2">like like autism right it just it it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.300" end="00:25:08.650" style="s2">means like you gots problems and like</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.610" end="00:25:10.570" style="s2">yeah like but like what if we really</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.650" end="00:25:12.190" style="s2">could like reason about that a little</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.570" end="00:25:16.390" style="s2">more formally you know it&#39;s pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.190" end="00:25:18.040" style="s2">to me yeah oh it&#39;s weird like like my</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.390" end="00:25:20.620" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to tease apart what</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.040" end="00:25:23.950" style="s2">belongs to what part of my you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.620" end="00:25:27.700" style="s2">sissy&#39;s my formal ones and my one is</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.950" end="00:25:29.590" style="s2">self diagnosed and that is it because</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.700" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">I&#39;m like I&#39;m allergic to stress like</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.590" end="00:25:34.630" style="s2">when I&#39;m under stress it&#39;s not that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:37.179" style="s2">like I&#39;m a strong person but like I fall</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.630" end="00:25:39.880" style="s2">asleep my nervous system shuts down and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.179" end="00:25:41.410" style="s2">so I&#39;ve had to de-stress my entire life</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.880" end="00:25:43.180" style="s2">like just be like nope</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.410" end="00:25:46.120" style="s2">gone that&#39;s gone that&#39;s gone and now</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.180" end="00:25:48.700" style="s2">that I&#39;m like at near zero stress as</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.120" end="00:25:51.460" style="s2">much as I could be I&#39;m now able to like</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.700" end="00:25:53.320" style="s2">add things back in and be like okay that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.460" end="00:25:55.900" style="s2">was a weird rule that I enforced</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.320" end="00:25:58.110" style="s2">and but like how important it is and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:26:00.700" style="s2">have chronic fatigue and I do have it</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.110" end="00:26:03.100" style="s2">there are things that aren&#39;t quite about</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.700" end="00:26:06.580" style="s2">autism but a huge piece of it was autism</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.100" end="00:26:09.690" style="s2">burnout was like oh all the sensory</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.580" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">coming at you all day every day and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.690" end="00:26:15.310" style="s2">dealing with other people&#39;s emotions is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:17.530" style="s2">exhausting and stressful and needing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.310" end="00:26:19.720" style="s2">like being able to do that without my</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.530" end="00:26:22.630" style="s2">mask on slightly easier but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.720" end="00:26:23.350" style="s2">hard and I need a lot of time to be by</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.630" end="00:26:26.110" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.350" end="00:26:29.680" style="s2">these stress did you also have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.110" end="00:26:31.240" style="s2">experience of like I understand now that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.680" end="00:26:33.880" style="s2">when there&#39;s a super loud you know a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.240" end="00:26:36.340" style="s2">siren goes by I&#39;m gonna have like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.880" end="00:26:38.440" style="s2">negative emotional response to that but</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.340" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">four decades of my life where I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.440" end="00:26:41.740" style="s2">know I was autistic I didn&#39;t realize I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:44.710" style="s2">had sensitivities I didn&#39;t really you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.740" end="00:26:46.300" style="s2">know I just thought oh I just am moody</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.710" end="00:26:49.120" style="s2">and get depressed or upset a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.300" end="00:26:50.260" style="s2">like there&#39;s no real reason for it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.120" end="00:26:52.540" style="s2">know it&#39;s just my brain chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.260" end="00:26:55.270" style="s2">whatever you know and like now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.540" end="00:26:57.910" style="s2">holy how did I not come like put</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.270" end="00:26:59.470" style="s2">together the fact that like the state</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.910" end="00:27:01.720" style="s2">that I&#39;m in is a direct result of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.470" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">and this and this and this I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.720" end="00:27:07.450" style="s2">similar in mind is often times delayed</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:10.030" style="s2">so like if I know like I&#39;ll hear sirens</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.450" end="00:27:12.010" style="s2">say and then I don&#39;t know what I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.030" end="00:27:13.900" style="s2">about it at first and so by the time the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.010" end="00:27:17.260" style="s2">grumpy comes it&#39;s passed and so it took</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.900" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">a long time yeah oh wait okay that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.260" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">just took me a few minutes to realize</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:23.350" style="s2">like my body goes into panic and then if</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:25.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t identify what&#39;s going on right</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.350" end="00:27:27.940" style="s2">away which is often hard then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.480" end="00:27:31.300" style="s2">into this like scared zone where my mood</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.940" end="00:27:36.520" style="s2">goes like later freeze and yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.300" end="00:27:38.140" style="s2">don&#39;t listen your legs over delay on it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.520" end="00:27:41.680" style="s2">too right that&#39;s the alexithymia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.140" end="00:27:43.360" style="s2">like so this is often held up as like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.680" end="00:27:45.790" style="s2">symptom of autism right like we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.360" end="00:27:46.930" style="s2">difficulty naming our own emotions but</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.790" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">the other place I always thought that me</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.930" end="00:27:52.930" style="s2">also shows up is toxic masculinity like</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:55.190" style="s2">a lot of men just can&#39;t name their own</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.930" end="00:27:57.560" style="s2">emotions either to the same extent and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.190" end="00:27:59.030" style="s2">not just because they&#39;re like you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.560" end="00:28:03.020" style="s2">dumb meatheads or whatever it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.030" end="00:28:05.930" style="s2">they literally can&#39;t and to me what that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.020" end="00:28:07.480" style="s2">says is that Alex emulate their you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.930" end="00:28:10.070" style="s2">suggest that Alex Athena is like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.480" end="00:28:12.050" style="s2">property that emerges when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.070" end="00:28:13.550" style="s2">have the validation of your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.050" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">state from the people around you right</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.550" end="00:28:18.710" style="s2">you experience emotions subjectively but</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:20.210" style="s2">you don&#39;t learn to map your subjective</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.710" end="00:28:22.070" style="s2">experience to other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.210" end="00:28:24.230" style="s2">presentation you have these two</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.070" end="00:28:27.050" style="s2">different every emotion has two parts</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.230" end="00:28:30.410" style="s2">and they&#39;re not connected very much my</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.050" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">experience yes you&#39;re talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.410" end="00:28:33.290" style="s2">realizing you were dissociated from us</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:35.060" style="s2">to your life I had the same thing I felt</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.290" end="00:28:37.640" style="s2">safe for the first time like a couple</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.060" end="00:28:40.510" style="s2">years ago and I was like wait what this</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.640" end="00:28:42.920" style="s2">is how everyone else is funny</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.510" end="00:28:47.360" style="s2">know what you were missing until you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.920" end="00:28:49.700" style="s2">heard it you&#39;re like whoa that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.360" end="00:28:51.410" style="s2">too like raising a child whom part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.700" end="00:28:53.570" style="s2">all stuff on your own autism is I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.410" end="00:28:55.280" style="s2">that she has a DD but she doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.570" end="00:28:57.190" style="s2">autism and I&#39;m like oh she has this</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.280" end="00:28:59.990" style="s2">piece but no but like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.190" end="00:29:02.450" style="s2">but she is in touch with her emotions</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.990" end="00:29:04.280" style="s2">she has taught me because I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.450" end="00:29:06.710" style="s2">in the way of them I knew enough that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.280" end="00:29:08.600" style="s2">knew I didn&#39;t know how to do that so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.710" end="00:29:10.460" style="s2">was like oh we&#39;re gonna let you do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.600" end="00:29:13.280" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna let you have a tantrum and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.460" end="00:29:16.130" style="s2">she&#39;d be like freaking out and then just</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.280" end="00:29:22.310" style="s2">like totally fine a minute later I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.130" end="00:29:24.680" style="s2">like can I do that anyone I mean I sue I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.310" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">assume anyone maybe I&#39;m wrong but I like</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.680" end="00:29:30.410" style="s2">to assume that anyone can learn this</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:32.660" style="s2">with time and care and skill and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.410" end="00:29:35.660" style="s2">that&#39;s how I did it I know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.660" end="00:29:37.640" style="s2">everyone um but I like I had also mmm um</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.660" end="00:29:39.620" style="s2">I have two kids one of them I&#39;m fairly</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.640" end="00:29:42.680" style="s2">certain is not autistic the other one</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.620" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">I&#39;m fairly certain is partly because she</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.680" end="00:29:45.980" style="s2">was having what I would see as meltdowns</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.150" style="s2">like I don&#39;t cystic meltdown and at a</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.980" end="00:29:48.740" style="s2">certain point I was like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.150" end="00:29:50.210" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure but I&#39;m gonna just raise</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.740" end="00:29:52.310" style="s2">her and start treating her like she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.210" end="00:29:54.670" style="s2">autistic and see if that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.310" end="00:29:56.840" style="s2">difference and everything got better um</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.670" end="00:29:58.580" style="s2">she very wasn&#39;t very rarely now how</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.840" end="00:30:00.440" style="s2">house meltdowns mind you she&#39;s she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.580" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">five so I mean my changes she gets older</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.440" end="00:30:04.220" style="s2">in the social pressure gets more but</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:07.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve been very like from the start with</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.220" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">both my kids like let&#39;s let&#39;s be aware</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.310" end="00:30:10.770" style="s2">of who we are of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:12.420" style="s2">we&#39;re feeling and of how that affects</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.770" end="00:30:15.420" style="s2">the people around us that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.420" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">thing as well which I understood very</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.420" end="00:30:19.350" style="s2">well how I affected people around me as</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.059" style="s2">a child um</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.350" end="00:30:23.130" style="s2">because I was hyper focused on that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.059" end="00:30:25.170" style="s2">because again I had a mom who was rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.130" end="00:30:27.390" style="s2">cruel and so it had to be kind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.170" end="00:30:29.670" style="s2">always aware of what was going on with</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.390" end="00:30:31.620" style="s2">her but not robbed me of the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.670" end="00:30:32.940" style="s2">be able to to do that for myself and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.620" end="00:30:34.800" style="s2">I want to make sure that my children</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.340" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">this journey like we are taught to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.160" end="00:31:45.000" style="s2">ashamed of who we are and of the way our</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:46.350" style="s2">minds and bodies work and anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.000" end="00:31:49.130" style="s2">listening to this who&#39;s struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.350" end="00:31:52.110" style="s2">this I just want to let you know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.130" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">that shame is not yours that shame is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.110" end="00:31:56.970" style="s2">something that other people put into you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:59.010" style="s2">to make you behave in ways that are more</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.970" end="00:32:00.570" style="s2">comfortable for them you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.010" end="00:32:01.830" style="s2">accept it and a lot of that was put</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.570" end="00:32:03.870" style="s2">there when you were a kid and you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.830" end="00:32:05.940" style="s2">know it&#39;s okay to put that shame down</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.870" end="00:32:07.820" style="s2">and to love who you are and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.940" end="00:32:10.830" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s struggling to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.820" end="00:32:12.059" style="s2">how to put down your mask and get in</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.830" end="00:32:13.830" style="s2">touch with who you actually are</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.059" end="00:32:16.980" style="s2">underneath which is something a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.830" end="00:32:20.130" style="s2">us actually get stuck with my advice to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.980" end="00:32:21.960" style="s2">you is to concentrate on those things</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.130" end="00:32:22.929" style="s2">that make you experience feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.960" end="00:32:24.940" style="s2">shame and fear</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.929" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">because those are the parts of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.940" end="00:32:29.289" style="s2">that you were taught to hate and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.460" style="s2">shame can become a map to those parts of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.289" end="00:32:32.710" style="s2">yourself that you need to learn to love</p>
