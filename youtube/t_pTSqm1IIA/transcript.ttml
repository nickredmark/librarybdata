<p begin="00:00:08.240" end="00:00:12.200" style="s2">interesting stories and with following</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.710" end="00:00:14.780" style="s2">your work on YouTube around the grievant</p>

<p begin="00:00:18.560" end="00:00:21.949" style="s2">they&#39;ve been on the channel a few times</p>

<p begin="00:00:27.440" end="00:00:33.019" style="s2">submitting that the papers to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.539" end="00:00:34.909" style="s2">journals and yeah I&#39;m really interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.019" end="00:00:38.690" style="s2">in talking to you about that experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.909" end="00:00:41.089" style="s2">and also kind of some of the ethical or</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.690" end="00:00:42.769" style="s2">moral dilemmas of that as kind of thrown</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.089" end="00:00:45.760" style="s2">up for everyone who&#39;s kind of paying</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.769" end="00:00:49.609" style="s2">attention to these extremely politicized</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:51.530" style="s2">hot-button topics but I&#39;d like to just</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.609" end="00:00:55.100" style="s2">start - how did you first become</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.530" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">involved in in this well I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.100" end="00:00:58.699" style="s2">into activism at the start that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:01:02.389" style="s2">something that I wanted to make a film</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.699" end="00:01:04.280" style="s2">on I think just the sheer proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.389" end="00:01:05.770" style="s2">of activism and how much of it we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.280" end="00:01:08.270" style="s2">seeing was something that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.770" end="00:01:11.240" style="s2">significant to me and I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.270" end="00:01:12.980" style="s2">figure out what was going on there there</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.240" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">was a particular group of activists</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.980" end="00:01:18.530" style="s2">within the whole realm of activism I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:19.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what they were at the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.530" end="00:01:23.810" style="s2">but I probably call them left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.700" end="00:01:26.690" style="s2">utopians now and it seemed like though</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.810" end="00:01:28.520" style="s2">there was this there was this spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.690" end="00:01:31.910" style="s2">revenge in there there was something</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.520" end="00:01:33.020" style="s2">destructive in inside their activism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.910" end="00:01:34.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t feel like they were being</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.020" end="00:01:37.610" style="s2">reported on properly through the media</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.820" end="00:01:40.150" style="s2">of work within a news network back home</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.610" end="00:01:43.010" style="s2">and the reports were a little bit off</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.150" end="00:01:45.800" style="s2">about these these particular activists</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.010" end="00:01:47.090" style="s2">and so I took it upon myself to go study</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.800" end="00:01:50.030" style="s2">them and to figure out what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.090" end="00:01:53.659" style="s2">there and it was the language that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.030" end="00:01:55.250" style="s2">were using that I mean all roads led</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.659" end="00:01:58.400" style="s2">back to the Academy things that were</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.250" end="00:02:00.770" style="s2">using terminology like suits normativity</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.400" end="00:02:02.210" style="s2">there was expansion and contraction of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.770" end="00:02:04.070" style="s2">concepts that I thought I&#39;d already</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.210" end="00:02:05.780" style="s2">known I thought these concepts were</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.070" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2">quite strange and I found them</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.780" end="00:02:12.360" style="s2">interesting and so I started hanging</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">at protests and rallies back home</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.360" end="00:02:16.470" style="s2">consume way more of them were popping up</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">and speaking to these people and just</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.470" end="00:02:23.880" style="s2">monitoring the digital activism that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:26.190" style="s2">was taking place and a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.880" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">concepts were coming from cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.190" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">studies in in the universities so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:34.310" style="s2">led me to the Academy speaking to people</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:38.430" style="s2">within these kind of critical cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.310" end="00:02:40.350" style="s2">studies disciplines and taking some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.430" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2">the studies to statisticians speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.350" end="00:02:44.340" style="s2">philosophers just to kind of get a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:47.130" style="s2">of a read on what the hell was going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.340" end="00:02:49.880" style="s2">because it sent something big</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.130" end="00:02:53.820" style="s2">culturally was taking place here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.880" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">eventually that led me to cross paths</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.820" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">with Peter Boghossian one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.080" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">Australian academics I thought talked to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">was I&#39;m saying you should speak to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">guy who&#39;s quite vocal about about you</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">know being in opposition to these these</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:10.770" style="s2">these studies where a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">was coming from and then he opened up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.770" end="00:03:15.150" style="s2">me and told me that he was about to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:18.300" style="s2">undergo a secret project with Helen Pike</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:21.660" style="s2">rose and James Lindsey and I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.300" end="00:03:23.700" style="s2">just it was all there it was this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.660" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">kind of fierce academic landscape to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.700" end="00:03:27.540" style="s2">make a film with Peters a bit of a weird</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:29.489" style="s2">guy so we&#39;ve got an eccentric character</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.540" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">I can play with and so it looked like</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.489" end="00:03:33.300" style="s2">good film to me and I just started</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">pursuing it yeah and I&#39;d love to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.300" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">with evergreen because I think you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:39.989" style="s2">called it a case study and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:44.940" style="s2">it&#39;s the most compelling vision I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:46.680" style="s2">seen of how the for want of a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.940" end="00:03:53.660" style="s2">word like intersection or social justice</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.680" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">ideology can turn into this very strange</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.660" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">authoritarian force inside an</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">institution I would love to play a clip</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:03.000" style="s2">from that the canoe which is just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:04.170" style="s2">most incredible scene yeah I&#39;d love if</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.000" end="00:04:06.360" style="s2">you could just talk through what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.170" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">on in that scene and what what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.360" end="00:04:11.010" style="s2">thought when you first saw it so at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">time that the Evergreen story kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.010" end="00:04:14.600" style="s2">fell into my lap I was looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:19.290" style="s2">scholarship and it looked like it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.600" end="00:04:21.000" style="s2">something more akin to theology than</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.290" end="00:04:24.870" style="s2">any kind of social science it was more</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:26.640" style="s2">it was more feeling out a moral system</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.870" end="00:04:29.460" style="s2">as opposed to some kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.640" end="00:04:31.200" style="s2">scientific process a lot of it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.460" end="00:04:33.990" style="s2">the deepest darkest kind of postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.200" end="00:04:35.730" style="s2">side of this scholarship and so it did</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.990" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">really have this morals kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.730" end="00:04:40.410" style="s2">religious element to it and around that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:45.270" style="s2">time when I was just getting my head</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.410" end="00:04:49.800" style="s2">around this stuff the Breton Brett wine</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.270" end="00:04:51.990" style="s2">scene had a hang had written a story for</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.800" end="00:04:53.940" style="s2">the Washington Examiner and they they</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.990" end="00:04:58.380" style="s2">linked to this piece of footage which</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.940" end="00:05:01.200" style="s2">was later I made it into this scene</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.380" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">within the series that I that I put up</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.200" end="00:05:07.500" style="s2">it was the infamous canoe scene and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">was just is one of the more fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.500" end="00:05:13.110" style="s2">things I&#39;ve ever seen it was just people</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:15.030" style="s2">that were it&#39;s really hard to explain</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.110" end="00:05:16.650" style="s2">well you&#39;re probably gonna have to show</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.030" end="00:05:20.190" style="s2">it for people to understand what took</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.650" end="00:05:26.180" style="s2">place there and we&#39;re gonna ask four key</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.190" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">stakeholders that are on this campus to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.180" end="00:05:36.210" style="s2">get on board our journey to equity so</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:39.690" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do first is s this is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.210" end="00:05:42.030" style="s2">council our council is large expansive</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.690" end="00:05:46.050" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna and we&#39;re gonna get on a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.030" end="00:05:48.120" style="s2">canoe it was a group the equity Council</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.050" end="00:05:54.480" style="s2">of Evergreen State College had been</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.120" end="00:05:57.300" style="s2">given a project to create a an equity</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.480" end="00:06:01.170" style="s2">proposal to change certain parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.300" end="00:06:03.630" style="s2">college and they had this event which</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.170" end="00:06:05.430" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really to talk over the equity</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.630" end="00:06:07.350" style="s2">plan which which they were mandated to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.430" end="00:06:09.000" style="s2">create Brett even said that they hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.350" end="00:06:10.500" style="s2">sent out the equity plan to anyone in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.000" end="00:06:11.940" style="s2">there before they had the meeting no</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.500" end="00:06:13.350" style="s2">they didn&#39;t he had to follow it up</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.940" end="00:06:17.250" style="s2">himself so I was like we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.350" end="00:06:18.710" style="s2">this this equity plan meeting which was</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.250" end="00:06:21.630" style="s2">kind of billed as a discussion I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.710" end="00:06:23.820" style="s2">but what took place was was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.630" end="00:06:28.020" style="s2">church service it really did it really</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.820" end="00:06:30.300" style="s2">felt like that there was a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.020" end="00:06:32.260" style="s2">authoritarian if you&#39;re not if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.300" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">not for this plan you&#39;re against us</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.260" end="00:06:35.260" style="s2">it was it would look to me a moral</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.750" style="s2">community that was policing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.260" end="00:06:39.970" style="s2">outskirts it was your URI the forest or</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.750" end="00:06:44.290" style="s2">against us and we&#39;re gonna get on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.970" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">canoe that&#39;s gonna sometimes have fierce</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.290" end="00:06:55.090" style="s2">waves unbearable headwinds and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:57.640" style="s2">intentional or unintentional extra</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.000" end="00:07:16.540" style="s2">so we got to make this happen you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.980" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">emotionally I&#39;m on board with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.540" end="00:07:22.210" style="s2">of you know the canoe journey to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">somewhere but this looked like they had</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.210" end="00:07:29.590" style="s2">cloaked a freight train in the imagery</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.000" end="00:07:34.120" style="s2">of a canoe Oh hold on one second the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.590" end="00:07:39.790" style="s2">senior administrators you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.120" end="00:07:43.410" style="s2">for permission and commits some things</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.790" end="00:07:46.970" style="s2">before boarding the canoe</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.410" end="00:07:46.970" style="s2">so can we step back out</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.520" end="00:07:52.719" style="s2">so I would like to board the food</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.960" end="00:07:55.710" style="s2">because I&#39;m committed to enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.719" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">further aid</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.090" end="00:08:32.940" style="s2">to be able to promote equity inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.169" end="00:08:41.640" style="s2">in the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.940" end="00:08:44.970" style="s2">and outside the there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.640" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">you just there&#39;s a sea of people engaged</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.970" end="00:08:51.980" style="s2">in a shared delusion and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:56.070" style="s2">few people witnessing the delusion and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.980" end="00:08:59.460" style="s2">isolated unable to exchange words or</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.070" end="00:09:02.850" style="s2">anything that sense of being alone in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.460" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">crowd is profound and that really was</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.850" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">how that meeting felt and in a crowd of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">people who are supposed to be your</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:14.010" style="s2">colleagues yeah who are sleepwalking</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:17.640" style="s2">people were asked to first say that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.010" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">were on board with this equity plan and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.640" end="00:09:23.610" style="s2">then they would step on this imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:25.830" style="s2">canoe and then move together off to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.610" end="00:09:27.960" style="s2">this magical land of equity I know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.830" end="00:09:29.340" style="s2">sounds it&#39;s how this aim but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.960" end="00:09:31.410" style="s2">piece of footage it was sitting in front</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.340" end="00:09:32.910" style="s2">of me and so I saw this and I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.410" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">already looking at this from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.910" end="00:09:37.500" style="s2">grievant studies perspective and it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:41.520" style="s2">just clear to me I have to get this into</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.500" end="00:09:43.770" style="s2">my film somehow yeah and so what I did</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.520" end="00:09:45.840" style="s2">because Pete is friends with Brett</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.770" end="00:09:48.060" style="s2">Weinstein and Heather hang we we sat</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.840" end="00:09:51.560" style="s2">down and they took me through the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.060" end="00:09:53.820" style="s2">Evergreen experience that they had and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.560" end="00:09:57.630" style="s2">yeah I turned it into a series which</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.820" end="00:09:59.520" style="s2">will then be condensed into a scene for</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.630" end="00:10:01.590" style="s2">the feature film that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.520" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">create yeah I want to say that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.590" end="00:10:05.070" style="s2">series will never agree and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:06.150" style="s2">mean I knew about the evergreen story</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.070" end="00:10:08.520" style="s2">and I would obviously talk to Heather</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.150" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">and to Bret quite a bit in the past but</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.520" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t really until seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:15.030" style="s2">especially the canoe scene but the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:16.620" style="s2">atmosphere of those films that you put</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.030" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">together then it becomes really real</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.620" end="00:10:20.820" style="s2">yeah I really highly advise anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.920" style="s2">hasn&#39;t seen them to watch them because</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.820" end="00:10:26.040" style="s2">it just you called it the case study and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.920" end="00:10:29.480" style="s2">I&#39;d agree it&#39;s it&#39;s the kind of perfect</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.040" end="00:10:32.880" style="s2">example of what happens when this I</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.480" end="00:10:35.910" style="s2">guess any idea any belief system can</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.880" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">become an ideology at times it shows</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.910" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">that there is something sinister if</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:41.910" style="s2">these ideas are pushed to that to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:44.660" style="s2">extreme this particular worldview of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.910" end="00:10:47.449" style="s2">systems of power being perpetuated</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.660" end="00:10:49.459" style="s2">language it&#39;s I know it&#39;s it&#39;s strange</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.449" end="00:10:52.490" style="s2">and academic but it&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.459" end="00:10:53.870" style="s2">worldview that if it gets to critical</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.490" end="00:10:55.670" style="s2">mass you&#39;re probably going to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.870" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">something within a closed system right</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.670" end="00:11:00.379" style="s2">like Evergreen is a it&#39;s a perfect case</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:02.449" style="s2">study for this thing because it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.379" end="00:11:04.100" style="s2">town you&#39;ve got your students which are</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.449" end="00:11:06.709" style="s2">the populous you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.100" end="00:11:08.569" style="s2">administration which are you know your</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.709" end="00:11:09.740" style="s2">governance you&#39;ve got police services</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.569" end="00:11:12.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve got food services you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.740" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">housing and so it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.410" end="00:11:18.910" style="s2">this perfect kind of little case study</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:21.829" style="s2">for petri dish that we dish yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.910" end="00:11:26.350" style="s2">if you want to take a moral angle on it</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.829" end="00:11:29.000" style="s2">but I mean it was and it&#39;s it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.350" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the canary in the coal mine as far</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.000" end="00:11:33.709" style="s2">as I can see it&#39;s because if you roll</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:35.509" style="s2">these ideas out they are built in such a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.709" end="00:11:37.939" style="s2">way where that is the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.509" end="00:11:40.220" style="s2">conclusion I think Benjamin voice is</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.939" end="00:11:43.100" style="s2">another one that his work I went on</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.220" end="00:11:46.610" style="s2">quite a bit as research to create my</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.100" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">series and he has delved into this whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.610" end="00:11:53.569" style="s2">nother level so it&#39;s it&#39;s worth looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:54.889" style="s2">at his stuff as well but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.569" end="00:12:00.769" style="s2">an indication of what could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.889" end="00:12:03.170" style="s2">happen if these this postmodern you left</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.769" end="00:12:05.300" style="s2">when utopian way is actually implemented</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.170" end="00:12:08.689" style="s2">in larger and larger scales it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.300" end="00:12:11.180" style="s2">concerning and with the the grievant</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.689" end="00:12:14.120" style="s2">studies piece yeah what what happened</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.180" end="00:12:15.649" style="s2">because I understand that it was they</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.120" end="00:12:17.420" style="s2">they were in the process of submitting</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.649" end="00:12:19.370" style="s2">more than the seven papers they got</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.420" end="00:12:21.199" style="s2">published but the whole thing got</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.370" end="00:12:24.019" style="s2">wrapped up on you so what was that like</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.199" end="00:12:25.459" style="s2">being sort of so I think I think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.019" end="00:12:28.100" style="s2">washing was at The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.459" end="00:12:30.019" style="s2">that we&#39;re about to publish on it so in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.100" end="00:12:32.569" style="s2">the end it they had to make it public</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.019" end="00:12:34.309" style="s2">yeah quite quickly how was that being in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.569" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">the middle of that um that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.309" end="00:12:39.769" style="s2">interesting so they had I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">five papers that had been published and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.769" end="00:12:45.209" style="s2">the most ridiculous one which was about</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.410" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">studying dog humping incidents to prove</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.209" end="00:12:51.970" style="s2">some kind of it&#39;s approved right culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:55.149" style="s2">as evidence of rape culture how people</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.970" end="00:13:05.620" style="s2">spoke about witnessing dog humping</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.149" end="00:13:08.290" style="s2">incidents I just read my email we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.620" end="00:13:09.910" style="s2">our first wind the dog bark paper has</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.170" end="00:14:52.780" style="s2">ludicrous paper and it had been</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.090" end="00:14:54.460" style="s2">published and a young journalist had</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.780" end="00:14:56.290" style="s2">found had found it and it was think</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.460" end="00:15:00.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong here and so she</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.290" end="00:15:02.890" style="s2">started looking into it and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.760" end="00:15:04.390" style="s2">like eventually got in contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.890" end="00:15:07.840" style="s2">journals and so the journals were</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.390" end="00:15:13.660" style="s2">contacting Jim&#39;s fake account for this</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.840" end="00:15:15.310" style="s2">thing and so it was the pressure the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.660" end="00:15:16.330" style="s2">pressure at that point was rising and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.310" end="00:15:17.620" style="s2">mean it&#39;s great from a filmmaking</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.330" end="00:15:20.980" style="s2">perspective but these guys are my</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.620" end="00:15:23.020" style="s2">friends now so it&#39;s like involved in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.980" end="00:15:26.170" style="s2">in in this kind of the wheels were</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.020" end="00:15:30.310" style="s2">falling off the project that they done</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.170" end="00:15:32.380" style="s2">and so at one point that the younger</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.310" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">journalists led to another journalist at</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.380" end="00:15:36.640" style="s2">the Wall Street Journal catching wind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:38.080" style="s2">what was going on and so the Worcester</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.640" end="00:15:41.500" style="s2">the older journalists at the Wall Street</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.080" end="00:15:44.530" style="s2">Journal had contacted the journal</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.500" end="00:15:46.360" style="s2">contacted the fake account and saying we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.530" end="00:15:48.460" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t think this paper you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.360" end="00:15:50.230" style="s2">done is we&#39;ve created his way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.460" end="00:15:52.600" style="s2">ridiculous we don&#39;t think you are a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.230" end="00:15:55.150" style="s2">scholar what&#39;s going on here and so at</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.600" end="00:15:58.390" style="s2">that point it was for the group it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.150" end="00:15:59.710" style="s2">do we lie to continue this and land more</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.390" end="00:16:01.450" style="s2">papers because there was a lot more in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.710" end="00:16:05.020" style="s2">circulation that were possibly getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.450" end="00:16:07.060" style="s2">published or or do we just come clean</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.020" end="00:16:10.150" style="s2">and and let the Wall Street Journal know</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.060" end="00:16:13.000" style="s2">and finish this thing almost a year</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.150" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">before they intended to finish so they</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.000" end="00:16:17.950" style="s2">decided to come clean because of you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.960" style="s2">know it would have been a case of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.950" end="00:16:23.890" style="s2">forging documents in order to keep keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.960" end="00:16:28.540" style="s2">the roots going and so that was an</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.890" end="00:16:29.650" style="s2">interesting thing to face because I</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.540" end="00:16:32.230" style="s2">don&#39;t think they were all ready for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.650" end="00:16:34.140" style="s2">onslaught that was about to take place I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.230" end="00:16:36.370" style="s2">didn&#39;t think they were ready for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.140" end="00:16:38.140" style="s2">potential shaming and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.370" end="00:16:39.760" style="s2">communicate this really complex thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.140" end="00:16:42.370" style="s2">like even the car I was there for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.760" end="00:16:45.220" style="s2">conversations with Gillian Melchor at</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.370" end="00:16:47.710" style="s2">The Wall Street Journal and you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.220" end="00:16:49.660" style="s2">tell she was sharp as helps like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.710" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">really good journalist but you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.660" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">tell that there was kind of a disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:53.260" style="s2">between what they were trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">because their taste</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.260" end="00:16:56.770" style="s2">in this academic language I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:58.390" style="s2">hanging out with him for a year and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.770" end="00:16:59.710" style="s2">half and I was only just starting to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.390" end="00:17:03.400" style="s2">find my feet and what the hell they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.710" end="00:17:04.870" style="s2">talking about and so it by that time I</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.400" end="00:17:05.830" style="s2">was friends with them and I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.870" end="00:17:08.080" style="s2">they weren&#39;t going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.830" end="00:17:11.890" style="s2">communicate this properly to the public</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.080" end="00:17:17.070" style="s2">and so having a background in news media</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.890" end="00:17:20.680" style="s2">and been in the middle of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.070" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">its press circuses before and seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.680" end="00:17:30.040" style="s2">it kind of works then I help them to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:32.110" style="s2">create content of their own and just</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.040" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">just a little bit of media training and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.110" end="00:17:36.940" style="s2">just what found helped them find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:38.800" style="s2">communicate this infinitely complex</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.940" end="00:17:40.330" style="s2">thing that wasn&#39;t going to make them</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.800" end="00:17:42.100" style="s2">look like these kind of misogynist</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.330" end="00:17:46.890" style="s2">racist people that it was clear that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.100" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">were going to be accused of being and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.890" end="00:17:50.770" style="s2">it was it was it was quite it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:53.770" style="s2">an interesting experience and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.770" end="00:17:56.350" style="s2">that the rule is is if you win the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.770" end="00:17:58.600" style="s2">the narrative within the first 48 hours</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.350" end="00:18:00.430" style="s2">he probably going to be okay and so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.600" end="00:18:02.020" style="s2">was about getting their version of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.430" end="00:18:04.840" style="s2">events out to as many people as humanly</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.020" end="00:18:07.180" style="s2">possible and so we created this big list</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:11.620" style="s2">of journalists that would potentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.180" end="00:18:13.780" style="s2">write favorably about it created a put</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.620" end="00:18:16.630" style="s2">all all the evidence all the peer review</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.780" end="00:18:18.340" style="s2">comments all the papers themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.630" end="00:18:22.810" style="s2">a big google file and then sent that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.340" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">link out to whoever wanted it and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.810" end="00:18:27.880" style="s2">created a write-up to try and explain</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:31.180" style="s2">the the project to the public so they</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.880" end="00:18:33.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be totally slaughtered and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.180" end="00:18:34.690" style="s2">seemed I think at the end of the day on</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.220" end="00:18:37.060" style="s2">balance that I think they came out on</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.690" end="00:18:38.710" style="s2">top which was which is great because it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.060" end="00:18:40.870" style="s2">started a conversation about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.710" end="00:18:42.520" style="s2">I think you said before that you did</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.870" end="00:18:45.100" style="s2">make a sort of decision to go from</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.520" end="00:18:46.450" style="s2">observer to participant yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.100" end="00:18:47.740" style="s2">something I feel with a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.450" end="00:18:51.190" style="s2">this area who are covering a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.740" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">these stories is that&#39;s a really hard I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.190" end="00:18:55.180" style="s2">mean I know as a journalist like I feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:58.180" style="s2">that that that the difficulty of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.180" end="00:19:01.240" style="s2">tension yeah it&#39;s like if you if you go</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.180" end="00:19:03.730" style="s2">from being a PI server to a participant</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.240" end="00:19:04.750" style="s2">how do you maintain kind of journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.730" end="00:19:05.990" style="s2">objectivity or</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.750" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">the objectivity of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.990" end="00:19:09.500" style="s2">storyteller well I guess I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:11.500" style="s2">storyteller another journalist I guess</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.500" end="00:19:13.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit of leeway there a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.500" end="00:19:15.470" style="s2">little bit of poetic license I guess but</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.880" end="00:19:18.050" style="s2">I think what the way I&#39;m gonna handle it</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.470" end="00:19:21.740" style="s2">is I&#39;m working toward a feature-length</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.050" end="00:19:23.050" style="s2">film about the about project and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.740" end="00:19:25.400" style="s2">just going to put it in like I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.050" end="00:19:29.230" style="s2">make no bones about it I did cross the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.400" end="00:19:31.580" style="s2">line and I did participate at some point</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.230" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">but I think that to me that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.580" end="00:19:36.860" style="s2">the story being interesting and just</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.890" style="s2">being honest about that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.860" end="00:19:41.090" style="s2">people can take a leave it or you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.890" end="00:19:45.640" style="s2">crucify me if they want as long as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.090" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">honest then that&#39;s cool yeah and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.640" end="00:19:49.690" style="s2">yeah because there&#39;s a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:53.540" style="s2">accusations within this space as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.690" end="00:19:55.100" style="s2">that the grifting tag is thrown around</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.540" end="00:19:56.540" style="s2">quite a lot and I know Peter sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.100" end="00:19:59.720" style="s2">talked about that in the past yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.540" end="00:20:02.210" style="s2">and I do think that that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.720" end="00:20:04.220" style="s2">temptation to like audience capture as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.210" end="00:20:06.380" style="s2">thing giving people what they want is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.220" end="00:20:08.510" style="s2">thing and there are sort of ethical</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.380" end="00:20:10.580" style="s2">boundaries that can get blurred yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.510" end="00:20:17.510" style="s2">do you think about that in what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.580" end="00:20:18.950" style="s2">doing yeah I do I guess I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.510" end="00:20:21.140" style="s2">reluctant to even do this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.950" end="00:20:22.940" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s strange to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.140" end="00:20:24.980" style="s2">step out into the public eye I just want</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.940" end="00:20:26.360" style="s2">to I want to do this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.980" end="00:20:29.330" style="s2">insofar as it can help me just make</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.360" end="00:20:32.030" style="s2">films and so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.330" end="00:20:34.760" style="s2">thing to step out in the public and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.030" end="00:20:35.750" style="s2">watch Helen Peter and Jim step out in</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.760" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">the public and all the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.750" end="00:20:43.790" style="s2">that go into you know protecting an</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:45.920" style="s2">image there&#39;s something off-putting to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.790" end="00:20:47.240" style="s2">me about that like I&#39;m reluctant to step</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.920" end="00:20:48.800" style="s2">out into the public because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.240" end="00:20:52.660" style="s2">to have to manage that I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.800" end="00:20:57.260" style="s2">just do what I want to do and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.660" end="00:20:59.450" style="s2">guess being honest is my true north and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.260" end="00:21:00.620" style="s2">so if I get into trouble for being</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.450" end="00:21:02.270" style="s2">honest and hanging out with the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.620" end="00:21:05.990" style="s2">people then so be it I kind of want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.270" end="00:21:08.660" style="s2">be the the how I want to behave how I</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.990" end="00:21:13.100" style="s2">want the world to be and I want the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.660" end="00:21:15.110" style="s2">world not to give a about let&#39;s say</p>

<p begin="00:21:29.450" end="00:21:34.190" style="s2">interests me and I&#39;m pulling the curtain</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.359" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">back on something I&#39;ve got my position</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.190" end="00:21:37.190" style="s2">on it if you don&#39;t agree with that then</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:44.479" style="s2">comes from the outside the way the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.499" end="00:21:49.239" style="s2">people are perceiving me and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.479" end="00:21:51.649" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the dilemma is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.239" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">participating with these guys and who</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.649" end="00:21:57.889" style="s2">were consent as provocateurs is that</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.609" end="00:22:06.649" style="s2">or our platforms not going to then buy</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.489" end="00:22:08.479" style="s2">the film that I&#39;m trying to make as my</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.649" end="00:22:08.899" style="s2">first feature-length film as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.479" end="00:22:12.769" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.899" end="00:22:14.899" style="s2">I don&#39;t know being too honest about my</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.769" end="00:22:17.830" style="s2">position about this thing so that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.899" end="00:22:21.169" style="s2">is where the dilemma dilemma lies is</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.830" end="00:22:25.159" style="s2">should I be protecting my image around</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.169" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">this stuff more than I am or yeah can</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.159" end="00:22:28.909" style="s2">you talk to me about what you think the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:31.099" style="s2">moral dilemma there is because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.909" end="00:22:32.629" style="s2">actually physically feel it I know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.099" end="00:22:37.070" style="s2">there was something wrong with it but it</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.629" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">came from the way that I thought that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.070" end="00:22:41.119" style="s2">would be perceived more than any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:45.979" style="s2">internal sense of this is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.119" end="00:22:48.489" style="s2">I feel the moral dilemma as in if I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.979" end="00:22:53.869" style="s2">if I was in your position pitching it to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.489" end="00:22:57.109" style="s2">mainstream broadcasters that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.869" end="00:22:59.299" style="s2">hard like an acknowledging that because</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.109" end="00:23:01.999" style="s2">they&#39;re seen and accused in some places</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.299" end="00:23:03.739" style="s2">of like highly politicized and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.999" end="00:23:08.499" style="s2">effectively they what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.739" end="00:23:10.970" style="s2">was highly politicized provocate</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.499" end="00:23:13.970" style="s2">provocation and didn&#39;t prove the things</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.970" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">that they wanted it to it was unethical</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.970" end="00:23:22.099" style="s2">etc etc - if that&#39;s how it&#39;s seen by at</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:23.659" style="s2">least some some people and that has some</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.099" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">traction into the mainstream as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.659" end="00:23:28.070" style="s2">yeah then being seen to be actually part</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:29.239" style="s2">of the project rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.070" end="00:23:30.600" style="s2">observing the project is a really</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.239" end="00:23:33.570" style="s2">difficult line to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.600" end="00:23:37.139" style="s2">to walk and I feel that for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.570" end="00:23:39.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like so yeah but that would be my</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.139" end="00:23:42.210" style="s2">my question from a sort of journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.960" end="00:23:43.799" style="s2">or an editorial perspective yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.210" end="00:23:46.620" style="s2">strikes me more of the practical problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.799" end="00:23:48.509" style="s2">right like I know that I&#39;m missing out</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.620" end="00:23:51.350" style="s2">on a lot of opportunities by delving</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.509" end="00:23:53.639" style="s2">into these interesting areas but</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.350" end="00:23:56.070" style="s2">personally it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.639" end="00:23:58.380" style="s2">moral to me like it&#39;s it&#39;s how the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.070" end="00:23:59.940" style="s2">views you know I&#39;m having a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.380" end="00:24:02.190" style="s2">trouble with that it&#39;s like how do you I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.940" end="00:24:02.850" style="s2">mean the Devils in the details it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.190" end="00:24:04.590" style="s2">in the film</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.850" end="00:24:07.230" style="s2">I&#39;ll be honest about it and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.590" end="00:24:09.570" style="s2">like it then so be it but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.230" end="00:24:13.409" style="s2">this whole guilt by association thing I</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.570" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">don&#39;t it can&#39;t continue can it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.409" end="00:24:20.940" style="s2">it&#39;s mmm doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:22.889" style="s2">continue it probably will continue but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.940" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">mean but it&#39;s constantly I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.889" end="00:24:28.909" style="s2">just something that I&#39;m constantly aware</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:31.110" style="s2">of in in all the work having kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.909" end="00:24:33.690" style="s2">started off the channel making films</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.110" end="00:24:35.309" style="s2">about Jordan Pederson and him not that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.690" end="00:24:37.169" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t quite as controversial a</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.309" end="00:24:39.539" style="s2">figure then as he is now but knowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.169" end="00:24:41.309" style="s2">that that&#39;s he&#39;s very controversial that</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.539" end="00:24:43.080" style="s2">there&#39;s many different kind of jordan</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.309" end="00:24:44.909" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s as well and kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.080" end="00:24:51.629" style="s2">kind of understand and tell all of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.909" end="00:24:53.580" style="s2">story and and also yeah being I guess</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.629" end="00:24:56.490" style="s2">all we can do is be true to our own</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.580" end="00:25:00.659" style="s2">ethical sense my my ethical sense is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.490" end="00:25:04.200" style="s2">sort of I I feel the need to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.659" end="00:25:05.909" style="s2">difficult question yes but also to tell</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.200" end="00:25:07.320" style="s2">the truth as much as I can in what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.909" end="00:25:08.850" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing and I&#39;ve asked I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.320" end="00:25:10.049" style="s2">some punchy interviews with people that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.850" end="00:25:12.539" style="s2">I felt that there are things that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.049" end="00:25:14.220" style="s2">need to ask and I also will try to ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.539" end="00:25:17.580" style="s2">questions like the questions I&#39;ll ask to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.220" end="00:25:19.559" style="s2">you that I feel a valid questions that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.580" end="00:25:22.590" style="s2">are skeptical observer might want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.559" end="00:25:23.970" style="s2">also think it&#39;s not of any service to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.590" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">the person I&#39;m interviewing if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.970" end="00:25:28.110" style="s2">ask those questions yeah because if if</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:29.100" style="s2">you don&#39;t if you&#39;re not asked those</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.110" end="00:25:31.470" style="s2">questions and you don&#39;t get the chance</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.100" end="00:25:33.929" style="s2">to respond then then you might not even</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.470" end="00:25:35.669" style="s2">know that that&#39;s an issue or you might</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.929" end="00:25:38.610" style="s2">not know it&#39;s an issue or it actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.669" end="00:25:40.139" style="s2">gives people a lot more most people know</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.610" end="00:25:41.940" style="s2">what&#39;s being said about them by people</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.139" end="00:25:42.730" style="s2">on the other side so you&#39;re not giving</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.940" end="00:25:45.669" style="s2">them the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.730" end="00:25:46.690" style="s2">say that is I think in a real yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.669" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">you&#39;re not addressing it and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.690" end="00:25:49.780" style="s2">giving them the opportunity to put their</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.070" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">side of the story that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.780" end="00:25:53.260" style="s2">important part yeah so what are we what</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:56.890" style="s2">are we talking about True North is truth</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.260" end="00:25:59.500" style="s2">in is some kind of truth is your your</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.890" end="00:26:01.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it in a sense which guides</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.500" end="00:26:03.220" style="s2">you toward what you want what you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.480" end="00:26:04.780" style="s2">to ask to feel good about yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.220" end="00:26:07.210" style="s2">it&#39;s just to be honest about those</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.780" end="00:26:08.590" style="s2">questions that are enabling you I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.210" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">we all do on some level but we also</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.590" end="00:26:14.230" style="s2">understand that there are other factors</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:16.360" style="s2">pulling us in different directions like</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.230" end="00:26:18.520" style="s2">there is an audience capture especially</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.360" end="00:26:21.160" style="s2">on YouTube YouTube leans leans more</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.520" end="00:26:23.650" style="s2">right than other social media sphere x&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.160" end="00:26:26.020" style="s2">prop mostly because I think there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.650" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">many of the topics that people want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.020" end="00:26:28.390" style="s2">see covered and not covered on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:31.210" style="s2">mainstream media or they&#39;re covered</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.390" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">through a very often quite sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.210" end="00:26:37.390" style="s2">naively liberal lens yeah and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">what has fueled the growth of YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.390" end="00:26:39.730" style="s2">that people are getting other</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:41.650" style="s2">perspectives when they felt they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.730" end="00:26:44.169" style="s2">getting them on the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.650" end="00:26:45.820" style="s2">yeah but then that audience itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.169" end="00:26:47.950" style="s2">starts to kind of pull in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.820" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">direction of the Darwin effect towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.950" end="00:26:52.570" style="s2">it&#39;s playing a win right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:53.950" style="s2">playing to be honest yeah I I was just I</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.570" end="00:26:57.280" style="s2">was thinking I&#39;ve got a friend who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.950" end="00:26:58.750" style="s2">quite famous back home and she talks</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.280" end="00:27:01.299" style="s2">about this she was like saying she</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.750" end="00:27:02.440" style="s2">wanted to post something and she was</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.299" end="00:27:03.580" style="s2">like oh no I couldn&#39;t face that I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.440" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2">what do you mean you&#39;re the one with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.580" end="00:27:07.090" style="s2">audience you&#39;re not working for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:09.070" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t just post it and she was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.090" end="00:27:11.410" style="s2">no no no that will upset that but I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.070" end="00:27:14.980" style="s2">up there and it was just it was just an</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.410" end="00:27:17.320" style="s2">instance of thinking you&#39;re your caged</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.980" end="00:27:19.030" style="s2">in by your audience you&#39;re there</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.030" end="00:27:23.620" style="s2">don&#39;t even being yourself and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.090" end="00:27:25.419" style="s2">think that that&#39;s that&#39;s got to be an</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.620" end="00:27:27.040" style="s2">issue there&#39;s something hanging out with</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.419" end="00:27:29.049" style="s2">all these academics as well as something</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.040" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">deep inside an academic to care so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.049" end="00:27:32.740" style="s2">about their the way they perceived I</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">think a lot of their career progression</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.740" end="00:27:38.950" style="s2">is branding yeah I just I see the weight</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:40.299" style="s2">of that oh my god I want to play that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.950" end="00:27:43.540" style="s2">game I don&#39;t know want to get in front</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.299" end="00:27:45.220" style="s2">there was this one make films so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.540" end="00:27:49.650" style="s2">mean it&#39;s something it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.220" end="00:27:51.669" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;m interested in because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.650" end="00:27:53.960" style="s2">particular with social media is such a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.669" end="00:27:56.750" style="s2">big thing now everyone the brand and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.960" end="00:27:59.390" style="s2">you how are they how are they</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.750" end="00:28:01.130" style="s2">interacting and how do you not forget</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.390" end="00:28:05.480" style="s2">yourself you know become the brand at</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.130" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">some point but yeah I mean yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.480" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">kind of gap that opens up between a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:10.700" style="s2">public persona and the real person I</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:13.309" style="s2">think it&#39;s like this sort of yawning</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.700" end="00:28:18.049" style="s2">void the great book the circle you read</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.309" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">the circle by Dave Eggers who wrote his</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.049" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">first book was called a heartbreaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">work of staggering genius right and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:27.409" style="s2">circle as a book was really really</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:30.590" style="s2">clever in the way it kind of just talks</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.409" end="00:28:32.419" style="s2">about the hole that opens up between as</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.590" end="00:28:33.470" style="s2">almost like yawning gap between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.419" end="00:28:35.480" style="s2">person you&#39;re presenting to the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.470" end="00:28:38.330" style="s2">and your worries about how that person</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.480" end="00:28:40.580" style="s2">is coming across now your actual the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.330" end="00:28:43.159" style="s2">your TrueNorth yeah your actual truth</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.580" end="00:28:45.950" style="s2">and here that&#39;s compromising oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.159" end="00:28:47.539" style="s2">she&#39;s getting deep well it reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.950" end="00:28:49.730" style="s2">what what what a lot of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.539" end="00:28:51.470" style="s2">covering like these these academic</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.730" end="00:28:54.890" style="s2">fields that a lot of them are identity</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.470" end="00:28:56.659" style="s2">studies and so first you gotta ask what</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.890" end="00:28:59.659" style="s2">the hell is an identity before you start</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.659" end="00:29:03.470" style="s2">playing with with with what you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.659" end="00:29:06.500" style="s2">what makes you you and I think that a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.470" end="00:29:10.429" style="s2">lot of the essential features that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.500" end="00:29:13.640" style="s2">that are guiding that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.429" end="00:29:16.220" style="s2">gathering groups together like things</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.640" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">like your sexual identity or your racial</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.220" end="00:29:21.289" style="s2">identity it&#39;s only a very small part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">you and if you a lot of these these</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.289" end="00:29:29.330" style="s2">fields are saying that that is you that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:30.919" style="s2">that&#39;s your main essence essence I guess</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.330" end="00:29:33.399" style="s2">yeah and we should read the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.919" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">through these these group identity</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.399" end="00:29:38.929" style="s2">markers and it&#39;s just it&#39;s so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:41.960" style="s2">odd to me yeah yeah the other the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.929" end="00:29:45.549" style="s2">factor that this this whole area brings</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.960" end="00:29:45.549" style="s2">up for me is this sort of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.059" end="00:29:53.480" style="s2">polarization and kind of a circling of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.380" end="00:29:54.940" style="s2">the wagons around different expand you</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.480" end="00:29:57.529" style="s2">must have had that experience like how</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.940" end="00:29:59.750" style="s2">in real time you talked about the press</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.529" end="00:30:01.730" style="s2">onslaught and the fact that kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.750" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">had then in the center of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.730" end="00:30:06.370" style="s2">male strong male strong it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.740" style="s2">difficult to then</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.370" end="00:30:11.320" style="s2">communicate outside that bubble so very</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.740" end="00:30:12.450" style="s2">easily get trapped in a bubble do you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.320" end="00:30:14.529" style="s2">you worry about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.450" end="00:30:16.210" style="s2">in what sense could you could you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.529" end="00:30:20.230" style="s2">elaborate then on that a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.210" end="00:30:22.360" style="s2">so trapped in a bubble is in well with</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.230" end="00:30:23.889" style="s2">that amount of attention on us you tend</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.360" end="00:30:27.549" style="s2">to get sort of defensive we tell you to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.889" end="00:30:29.559" style="s2">get like academic academia and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.549" end="00:30:30.909" style="s2">in general relies on us being open to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.559" end="00:30:33.580" style="s2">changing our ideas and having</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.909" end="00:30:35.470" style="s2">conversations and it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.580" end="00:30:38.860" style="s2">difficult in the middle of these these</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.470" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">kind of massive media storms it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.860" end="00:30:42.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible like you have to put</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:44.380" style="s2">up a front like that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.220" end="00:30:47.049" style="s2">big part of what when the media</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.380" end="00:30:49.929" style="s2">explosion happened and how I was useful</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.049" end="00:30:53.830" style="s2">there was was to create a meme version</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.929" end="00:30:57.159" style="s2">of the the you know something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.830" end="00:30:59.409" style="s2">understandable of the project and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.159" end="00:31:01.059" style="s2">introduced we were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.409" end="00:31:02.740" style="s2">speed like you need that spear tip to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.059" end="00:31:04.120" style="s2">penetrate so people can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.740" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">understand it and then only then you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.120" end="00:31:11.049" style="s2">start to move down to the more complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:12.340" style="s2">layers so it&#39;s it&#39;s not not in a media</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.049" end="00:31:16.299" style="s2">storm it&#39;s not possible you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.340" end="00:31:19.659" style="s2">getting you&#39;re not getting a accurate</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.299" end="00:31:24.940" style="s2">description of the underlying events I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.659" end="00:31:27.669" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think yeah the news media</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.940" end="00:31:33.340" style="s2">is kind of like a mythological thing as</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.669" end="00:31:35.649" style="s2">I&#39;ve had experiences of being part of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.340" end="00:31:38.590" style="s2">media storm before I think my first film</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.649" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">my first film was about an experience I</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.590" end="00:31:45.549" style="s2">had where I filmed a racist incident on</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:48.669" style="s2">a bus and I then made a video of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.549" end="00:31:50.230" style="s2">and uploaded it to YouTube in revenge</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.669" end="00:31:52.120" style="s2">for these guys who were being racist</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.230" end="00:31:56.190" style="s2">dicks I felt like they had won over me</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.120" end="00:31:59.230" style="s2">and it was a personal thing I guess and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.190" end="00:32:01.870" style="s2">that just got taken up into the media</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.230" end="00:32:04.090" style="s2">and it was this big circus whirlwind</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.870" end="00:32:06.100" style="s2">around it and my experience of the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.090" end="00:32:07.649" style="s2">underlying story and what took place on</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.100" end="00:32:10.120" style="s2">that bus and what was being reported</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.649" end="00:32:12.549" style="s2">just did verge further and further away</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.120" end="00:32:14.980" style="s2">from each other and it gives you once</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.549" end="00:32:17.110" style="s2">you&#39;re in once you&#39;ve been through a big</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.980" end="00:32:19.160" style="s2">storm like that you do get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.110" end="00:32:24.920" style="s2">what&#39;s having me twice now with</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.160" end="00:32:27.290" style="s2">you get a sense of how bad the the media</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.920" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">machine is for communicating any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.290" end="00:32:31.610" style="s2">nuance or what was actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:34.250" style="s2">there like it&#39;s it&#39;s these strange</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.610" end="00:32:36.560" style="s2">little collapsed mean versions of what</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.250" end="00:32:38.900" style="s2">happened and now they&#39;re politicized</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.560" end="00:32:43.100" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got the right wing taken the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.900" end="00:32:44.360" style="s2">left wing take you&#39;ve got the lens</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.100" end="00:32:45.920" style="s2">through which they interpret the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.360" end="00:32:49.720" style="s2">underlying events which are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.920" end="00:32:53.060" style="s2">infinitely complex most the time our</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.720" end="00:32:54.140" style="s2">simplified and so once you&#39;ve once</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.060" end="00:32:56.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve been through one of these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.140" end="00:32:59.180" style="s2">you start looking at me start reading</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.770" end="00:33:01.460" style="s2">media interpretations of advancing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.180" end="00:33:06.140" style="s2">just not seeing the truth there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.460" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s fake news is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.140" end="00:33:10.670" style="s2">is a thing I think people are getting a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:11.570" style="s2">sense of that as well what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.670" end="00:33:13.490" style="s2">are the biggest things that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.570" end="00:33:16.580" style="s2">learnt over the last two years of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.490" end="00:33:21.380" style="s2">following these projects because thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.580" end="00:33:23.990" style="s2">out the lines well the whole thing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.380" end="00:33:27.080" style="s2">being a learning pro pro process like I</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.990" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">think I found it very early on that in</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.080" end="00:33:32.240" style="s2">order to have a perspective to tell this</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:34.850" style="s2">story I need to study what Helen Pete</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.240" end="00:33:37.130" style="s2">Jim was studying because otherwise I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.850" end="00:33:38.630" style="s2">just the conduit for what they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.130" end="00:33:40.040" style="s2">saying you know first of all I had to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.630" end="00:33:44.750" style="s2">figure out whether they were talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:46.750" style="s2"> or there was something to what they</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.750" end="00:33:50.120" style="s2">were saying and so the process is being</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.750" end="00:33:52.130" style="s2">a lot of study I guess it&#39;s like a DIYs</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.120" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">masters that I&#39;ve been doing with this</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.130" end="00:34:00.230" style="s2">with this film and so I mean I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:02.210" style="s2">it&#39;s so complicated that I can&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.230" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">you this pithy and so I&#39;ve learned this</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.210" end="00:34:06.170" style="s2">and this is what&#39;s going on it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:08.740" style="s2">deeper understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.170" end="00:34:11.389" style="s2">philosophical underpinnings of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.740" end="00:34:14.600" style="s2">these critical studies are about and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.389" end="00:34:16.790" style="s2">what their effect on culture in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.600" end="00:34:19.129" style="s2">sense and how would you summarize that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.790" end="00:34:22.820" style="s2">well that&#39;s the difficult thing I guess</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.129" end="00:34:25.179" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s criticism with no with no</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.820" end="00:34:27.620" style="s2">solutions I guess if you really had to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.179" end="00:34:28.010" style="s2">drill down to what is actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.620" end="00:34:31.010" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.010" end="00:34:31.930" style="s2">the method is criticize something until</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.010" end="00:34:34.660" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.930" end="00:34:37.810" style="s2">are disenfranchised and then create some</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.660" end="00:34:39.820" style="s2">kind of revolution so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.810" end="00:34:43.210" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s main doubt and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.820" end="00:34:44.950" style="s2">thing that a lot of people are picking</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.210" end="00:34:46.810" style="s2">up and it&#39;s having a really big cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.950" end="00:34:49.630" style="s2">effect right now is the criticism</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.810" end="00:34:51.370" style="s2">it&#39;s the complaining without it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.630" end="00:34:53.350" style="s2">cynical complaining right like you need</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.370" end="00:34:57.250" style="s2">you need the complainants to keep you in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.350" end="00:34:59.230" style="s2">check if you&#39;re if you&#39;re not looking</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.250" end="00:35:01.480" style="s2">after certain groups or you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.230" end="00:35:02.650" style="s2">you&#39;re coming to capitalist and and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.480" end="00:35:06.280" style="s2">know hurting the environment and things</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.650" end="00:35:08.140" style="s2">like that but there is if you don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.280" end="00:35:10.030" style="s2">at the practical nature of the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.140" end="00:35:11.830" style="s2">and look at it with a bit of love if</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.030" end="00:35:14.260" style="s2">you&#39;re just completely cynical and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.830" end="00:35:18.040" style="s2">criticize it the norms that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.260" end="00:35:19.450" style="s2">criticizing there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.040" end="00:35:21.610" style="s2">there there&#39;s something wrong there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.450" end="00:35:23.350" style="s2">I think it&#39;s having an outsized cultural</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.610" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">effect right now and I think a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.350" end="00:35:28.690" style="s2">is sensing that and where does the film</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:31.930" style="s2">go from here waiting to see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.690" end="00:35:33.580" style="s2">with with Peter Bogosian and because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.930" end="00:35:36.370" style="s2">guess that&#39;s the kind of end end of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.580" end="00:35:39.340" style="s2">film and what happens to him yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.370" end="00:35:40.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve captured all the events I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.340" end="00:35:44.290" style="s2">I&#39;m getting to a point where I can say</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.750" end="00:35:46.440" style="s2">something meaningful about the subject</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.290" end="00:35:49.830" style="s2">matter and so I&#39;ll inject that into it</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.440" end="00:35:51.880" style="s2">but the the final point is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.830" end="00:35:54.190" style="s2">investigations against Peter Pearce you</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.880" end="00:35:56.050" style="s2">are ongoing so I&#39;m just waiting until</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.190" end="00:35:57.730" style="s2">that&#39;s finished so I can have an end</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.050" end="00:36:01.750" style="s2">point it&#39;ll be interesting to see what</p>
