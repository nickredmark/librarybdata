<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:09.059" style="s2">work for svenska Dogbot which is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.180" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">newspaper one of the the second largest</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.059" end="00:00:13.500" style="s2">with daily circulation swing and then I</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">ask sometimes on Twitter and Facebook if</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">they excited what kind of people do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">think I should interview and and your</p>

<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">heard this before so and then recently I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">wrote piecing in collects all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:34.110" style="s2">freedom in in Sweden and and you shared</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">it on twitter and facebook so then i</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.110" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">that&#39;s when i mail you because then i</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">thought that perhaps now I have a</p>

<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">out to be quite quite the platform man</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">yes you know I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:55.170" style="s2">I did an interview with Claire layman I</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">interviewed her which I haven&#39;t released</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:01:02.180" style="s2">yet but I but will in the next probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">two weeks something like that but she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.180" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">hitting it out of the park as far as</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">aren&#39;t far as I&#39;m concerned it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">reminds me of what magazine like</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">Harper&#39;s used to be or at the Atlantic</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:18.259" style="s2">before before mainstream journalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:22.080" style="s2">collapsed virtually completely and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.259" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">became so politicized so yeah well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.080" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">been really impressive I would just ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:34.590" style="s2">that it&#39;s something that like a mother</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">of two or one yeah raelia</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.590" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">and just being fed up with the political</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">correctness of her psychology department</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">I think it was and then she starts quill</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">it and now we&#39;re all like sharing in her</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">project from all over the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:51.090" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">and she well she has really good</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:57.290" style="s2">editorial sense she must be really smart</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">that that girl yeah I would say so too</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.290" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">and but I&#39;ll try I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">remember I&#39;ll just begin by asking you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">about the Sweden Sweden case I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">know if you remember what the article</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:14.130" style="s2">was about but I wrote about Eric green</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:17.100" style="s2">Marv is a professor at</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.130" end="00:02:21.240" style="s2">political science department and he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:23.310" style="s2">forced to include Judith Butler but you</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.240" end="00:02:25.860" style="s2">did Butler on his literally oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:26.850" style="s2">right Judith Butler yeah yeah great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.860" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.850" end="00:02:32.960" style="s2">and the course is about modern society</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:36.210" style="s2">and its and its critics so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.960" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">basically about the reactionary forces</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.210" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">and left-wing extremist forces during</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">the turn of the last century so in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:49.500" style="s2">early 20th century and late 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:53.670" style="s2">and then new leaf Butler and actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.500" end="00:02:55.620" style="s2">one of the course not Eric but his other</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.670" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">his teaching assistant interviewed at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.620" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">you get butter and she said that she is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:02.370" style="s2">agreed with the method so is she agreed</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">with the professors that she did she</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.370" end="00:03:08.610" style="s2">thought that the academic freedom was</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:12.360" style="s2">more important than being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.610" end="00:03:14.820" style="s2">teach about feminist authors and gender</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.360" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">science so she was actually on the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.820" end="00:03:20.310" style="s2">side gender science yeah exactly is by</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.120" end="00:03:22.290" style="s2">no means a scientist or even a credible</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.310" end="00:03:25.020" style="s2">academic as far as I&#39;m concerned I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.290" end="00:03:27.390" style="s2">she&#39;s a straight-out ideologue and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.020" end="00:03:29.490" style="s2">the fact that anybody would be forced</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.390" end="00:03:31.170" style="s2">well first of all force to include</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.490" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">anything on their curriculum I think is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.170" end="00:03:35.670" style="s2">absolutely reprehensible it&#39;s talk down</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.810" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">interference with academic freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.670" end="00:03:42.990" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinarily dangerous because</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">once that precedent is established then</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.990" end="00:03:47.910" style="s2">you open the door for political</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">interference in the like like organized</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:52.830" style="s2">political interference from outside the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.280" end="00:03:54.570" style="s2">Academy and it&#39;ll collapse very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.830" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">under certain we saw that happening in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.570" end="00:03:58.440" style="s2">Germany and also in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:02.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like that can happen so quickly</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.440" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">that people can&#39;t can&#39;t it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.520" end="00:04:07.170" style="s2">impossible to believe now we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.400" end="00:04:08.850" style="s2">weird situation where the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.170" end="00:04:12.300" style="s2">seems to be happening to a large degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.850" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">within the Academy itself and so and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.300" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">what to do about that is by no means</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:21.480" style="s2">obvious but but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:24.120" style="s2">allowing external control of any sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.480" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">over the contents of the courses that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.120" end="00:04:28.370" style="s2">Professor teach professors teaches it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:32.039" style="s2">a very very bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.370" end="00:04:33.659" style="s2">we they have a rule rule of thumb they</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.039" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">call it but it&#39;s basically it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.659" end="00:04:39.180" style="s2">more a rule than a rule of thumb but at</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:41.849" style="s2">least 40% of all the literature has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.180" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">be written by women so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.849" end="00:04:44.550" style="s2">unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">if you&#39;re holding a course for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:48.659" style="s2">about porn in society and it&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:51.539" style="s2">critics with a lot of primary literature</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.659" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">from the turn of the century then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.539" end="00:04:57.330" style="s2">run into a problem because women weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:05:00.110" style="s2">so they weren&#39;t a lot of women who were</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.330" end="00:05:05.639" style="s2">respect them oh you know is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.110" end="00:05:07.080" style="s2">unbelievably I would say resentful I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.639" end="00:05:10.110" style="s2">really think that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.080" end="00:05:12.539" style="s2">issue here to push a dr. resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.110" end="00:05:14.759" style="s2">uninformed to push a doctrine like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.539" end="00:05:16.319" style="s2">look it&#39;s unbelievably widespread so</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.759" end="00:05:18.930" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you an example that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.319" end="00:05:21.449" style="s2">that&#39;s very similar our prime minister</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.930" end="00:05:23.219" style="s2">Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.449" end="00:05:25.860" style="s2">half the cabinet that he put together</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.219" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">would be women he&#39;s right the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.860" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">only approximately I think it was 20 to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:34.169" style="s2">25 percent of the elected officials were</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.150" end="00:05:36.120" style="s2">female and so what he basically admitted</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.169" end="00:05:38.219" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned art</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.120" end="00:05:39.990" style="s2">was two things number one he was</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.219" end="00:05:42.990" style="s2">incapable of judging people on their</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.990" end="00:05:45.029" style="s2">competence because when you put together</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.990" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">something like the cabinet for a country</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.029" end="00:05:50.669" style="s2">what you do is you find the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:52.710" style="s2">competent people period because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.669" end="00:05:54.569" style="s2">bizarre that it even has to be said</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.710" end="00:05:57.690" style="s2">because it actually turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.569" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">cabinet is important and so to me all he</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.690" end="00:06:04.139" style="s2">did was default on his set his central</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:05.940" style="s2">moral obligation to screen every single</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.139" end="00:06:07.650" style="s2">one of his members of parliament with</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.940" end="00:06:10.349" style="s2">exceeding care and to pick the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.650" end="00:06:16.289" style="s2">qualified people and his rationale was</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.349" end="00:06:19.500" style="s2">that it was 2015 you know so and we to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.289" end="00:06:22.460" style="s2">reduce competence to racial ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.500" end="00:06:24.650" style="s2">gender identity something like that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.460" end="00:06:26.909" style="s2">absolutely appalling move</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.650" end="00:06:29.190" style="s2">philosophically as well as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.909" end="00:06:31.289" style="s2">concerned to assume that diversity is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.190" end="00:06:32.879" style="s2">somehow represented by group membership</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.289" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">there&#39;s no evidence for that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.879" end="00:06:36.570" style="s2">absolutely no scientific evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:38.849" style="s2">that whatsoever in fact the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.570" end="00:06:41.399" style="s2">evidence suggests quite the contrary</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.849" end="00:06:42.009" style="s2">which is that there&#39;s more variability</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.399" end="00:06:43.689" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.009" end="00:06:45.819" style="s2">in groups than there is between groups</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.689" end="00:06:48.129" style="s2">which is actually an antidote to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.819" end="00:06:49.839" style="s2">central racist claim right because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.129" end="00:06:52.029" style="s2">central racist claim is there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.839" end="00:06:54.189" style="s2">difference between groups than there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.029" end="00:06:56.289" style="s2">difference within them and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.189" end="00:07:03.639" style="s2">you seen one black person you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.289" end="00:07:06.009" style="s2">them all and well well this is we</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.639" end="00:07:11.050" style="s2">actually have in Sweden it&#39;s cold</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.009" end="00:07:14.430" style="s2">I think the translation is gender</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.050" end="00:07:17.740" style="s2">mainstreaming in English but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.430" end="00:07:21.849" style="s2">basically you have to include gender</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.740" end="00:07:23.229" style="s2">scientific perspectives into all this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.849" end="00:07:26.770" style="s2">happening within all Swedish</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.229" end="00:07:29.949" style="s2">universities right now so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.770" end="00:07:31.930" style="s2">include the this perspective of gender</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.949" end="00:07:34.149" style="s2">gender scientific gender scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.930" end="00:07:36.370" style="s2">perspective in all parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.149" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">university so it&#39;s not just literature</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.370" end="00:07:42.189" style="s2">lists and courses it&#39;s also the who you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:45.339" style="s2">gonna recruit the number of and we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.189" end="00:07:49.559" style="s2">a goal in Sweden from the government</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.339" end="00:07:53.499" style="s2">this is all the government&#39;s doing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.559" end="00:07:57.219" style="s2">we have a goal that I think it&#39;s 40% of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.499" end="00:07:58.959" style="s2">all the professor&#39;s by 2020 should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.219" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">women right which means that if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.959" end="00:08:03.490" style="s2">young man who&#39;s entering academia the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:06.519" style="s2">probability that you&#39;re gonna get a job</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.490" end="00:08:08.019" style="s2">is zero yeah right and that yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.519" end="00:08:09.580" style="s2">same things happening here so for</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.019" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">example this there are minister of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.580" end="00:08:16.089" style="s2">science who was one of the people let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:18.219" style="s2">say selected because of Trudeau&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.089" end="00:08:23.229" style="s2">insistence upon gender equity in his</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.219" end="00:08:25.569" style="s2">cabinet you know he could have picked a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.229" end="00:08:28.389" style="s2">number of women that was proportionate</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.569" end="00:08:29.860" style="s2">to the number of women elected like even</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.389" end="00:08:31.059" style="s2">that I wouldn&#39;t have agreed with because</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.860" end="00:08:33.190" style="s2">I think he should have gone on straight</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.059" end="00:08:34.779" style="s2">competence and and taken on the heavy</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.190" end="00:08:39.099" style="s2">moral burden of trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.779" end="00:08:41.349" style="s2">what competence meant but just but no it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.099" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">had to be 50/50 because I guess that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.349" end="00:08:44.769" style="s2">you know this is a very snide thing to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.569" style="s2">say but that seems to be at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.769" end="00:08:50.740" style="s2">arithmetic intelligence that he could</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.569" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">manifest no it&#39;s and and one of his</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.740" end="00:08:54.550" style="s2">ministers our minister of science has we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:55.080" style="s2">have this program called count the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.550" end="00:08:56.730" style="s2">Canada</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.080" end="00:08:59.010" style="s2">research chairs and the Canada Research</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.730" end="00:09:00.360" style="s2">Chair zwarst up so that Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.010" end="00:09:01.950" style="s2">universities would have an additional</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.360" end="00:09:04.620" style="s2">amount of money to hire the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.950" end="00:09:08.340" style="s2">qualified people they possibly could for</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.620" end="00:09:10.530" style="s2">senior named chair positions and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.340" end="00:09:12.810" style="s2">idea was to attract international talent</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.530" end="00:09:14.850" style="s2">like high-level now what has happened</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.810" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t very well designed</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.850" end="00:09:18.360" style="s2">this program was that Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.730" style="s2">universities mostly ended up poaching</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.360" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">from each other which was you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.730" end="00:09:24.600" style="s2">relatively counterproductive because it</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:26.100" style="s2">just elevated the salaries of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.600" end="00:09:27.750" style="s2">professors which maybe they deserved</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.100" end="00:09:30.420" style="s2">rather than bringing in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.750" end="00:09:32.520" style="s2">international talent but men were</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.420" end="00:09:35.280" style="s2">radically over-represented in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.520" end="00:09:36.960" style="s2">research chairs now the minister of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.280" end="00:09:38.370" style="s2">science is very annoyed about this and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.960" end="00:09:41.550" style="s2">thinks that that&#39;s a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.370" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">systemic you know misogyny or some some</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.550" end="00:09:45.690" style="s2">bloody thing failing to note entirely</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">see if you look at scientific</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.690" end="00:09:51.140" style="s2">productivity it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:55.230" style="s2">because an gender the median professor</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.140" end="00:09:58.440" style="s2">male and female publish approximately</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.230" end="00:10:01.560" style="s2">the same amount so the typical but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.440" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">the exceptional professors are almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.560" end="00:10:06.630" style="s2">all men even though the typical male and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:09.000" style="s2">female can&#39;t really be distinguished in</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.630" end="00:10:10.830" style="s2">academia if you take that tiny subset of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.000" end="00:10:13.830" style="s2">hyper productive professors they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.830" end="00:10:15.510" style="s2">almost all male now why that is is my</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.830" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">suspicions arts that is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.510" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">straightforward I suspect that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:22.110" style="s2">reason it is is because to be a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:24.150" style="s2">productive in any given field means you</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.110" end="00:10:26.610" style="s2">have to be absolutely single-minded and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.150" end="00:10:28.830" style="s2">obsessed about it as well as being very</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.610" end="00:10:32.280" style="s2">intelligent conscientious so it&#39;s rare</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.830" end="00:10:33.930" style="s2">right you have to be intelligent say</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.280" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">99th percentile</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.930" end="00:10:39.840" style="s2">conscientious 95th percentile so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:42.840" style="s2">hardly anybody right there and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.840" end="00:10:44.970" style="s2">have to have the time available to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.840" end="00:10:48.090" style="s2">nothing whatsoever but concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.970" end="00:10:49.710" style="s2">your work no family no friends nothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.090" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">like that if you&#39;re gonna be at the very</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.710" end="00:10:55.320" style="s2">top of your profession because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll get out competed otherwise now</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.320" end="00:11:01.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot harder for women because</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:03.290" style="s2">well for obvious reasons I mean win so</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.890" end="00:11:05.209" style="s2">so the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.290" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">fact that most of these people were see</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.209" end="00:11:10.070" style="s2">the other thing people don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:13.370" style="s2">is that people can on average be very</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.070" end="00:11:15.079" style="s2">similar so their distributions but if</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:17.209" style="s2">you go way out onto the edges of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.079" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">distribution small differences in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.209" end="00:11:21.980" style="s2">middle can make massive differences at</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:23.449" style="s2">the edge and so and that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.980" end="00:11:25.339" style="s2">phenomena you see where you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.449" end="00:11:27.560" style="s2">selecting the highest qualified people</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.339" end="00:11:29.449" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an edge of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.560" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">phenomena so here&#39;s an example this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.449" end="00:11:33.319" style="s2">really cool one so if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:35.959" style="s2">overlap between male and female</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.319" end="00:11:38.569" style="s2">aggression it&#39;s pretty high so if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.959" end="00:11:40.910" style="s2">randomly select a man and a woman from</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.569" end="00:11:42.740" style="s2">the general population and you bet that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.910" end="00:11:45.050" style="s2">the woman was the more aggressive of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.740" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">two you&#39;d be right 40 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.050" end="00:11:51.790" style="s2">time which is actually pretty often so</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.290" end="00:11:54.709" style="s2">but if you go way the hell out to where</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.790" end="00:11:57.980" style="s2">let&#39;s say you only imprisoned the one in</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.709" end="00:12:01.819" style="s2">100 most aggressive people they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.980" end="00:12:05.029" style="s2">men yeah even though on average you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.819" end="00:12:07.370" style="s2">it&#39;s 60/40 you go out to the 99th</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.029" end="00:12:08.990" style="s2">percentile it&#39;s all men which is why</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.370" end="00:12:15.170" style="s2">almost all the people in prison are men</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.990" end="00:12:16.730" style="s2">now so people well it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.170" end="00:12:18.230" style="s2">you&#39;re describing in Sweden that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.730" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">death of the universities it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.230" end="00:12:21.170" style="s2">it&#39;s another sign of like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.569" style="s2">universities are killing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.170" end="00:12:26.089" style="s2">they&#39;re hiring adjunct professors and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.569" end="00:12:27.829" style="s2">not faculty members like I think it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.089" end="00:12:29.779" style="s2">to 70 percent in some American</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.829" end="00:12:32.839" style="s2">universities they have no salary no</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.779" end="00:12:35.630" style="s2">power no autonomy no job security</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.839" end="00:12:36.980" style="s2">nothing it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.630" end="00:12:39.829" style="s2">these adjuncts teach four or five</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.980" end="00:12:45.019" style="s2">courses a year and make $25,000 so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.829" end="00:12:47.300" style="s2">read about one who lived in her car yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.019" end="00:12:50.750" style="s2">okay so they&#39;ve jacked up tuition</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.300" end="00:12:54.430" style="s2">honorary materials yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.750" end="00:12:57.319" style="s2">well that there you go you know if the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.430" end="00:12:59.509" style="s2">little Marxist or you hahahaha</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.319" end="00:13:00.790" style="s2">they&#39;ve jacked up tuition to the point</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.509" end="00:13:03.529" style="s2">where it&#39;s unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.790" end="00:13:05.449" style="s2">they made it impossible for kids who</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.529" end="00:13:07.550" style="s2">rack up tuition debt to declare</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.449" end="00:13:09.110" style="s2">bankruptcy because they&#39;ve taken that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.550" end="00:13:10.790" style="s2">out of the bankruptcy laws now you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.110" end="00:13:13.790" style="s2">take away their driver&#39;s license if they</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.790" end="00:13:15.860" style="s2">don&#39;t pay their their their tuition</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:17.209" style="s2">their student loan bills so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.860" end="00:13:19.730" style="s2">basically indentured serve</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.209" end="00:13:22.249" style="s2">dude right the administration has become</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.319" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">increasingly are spreading their</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.559" end="00:13:51.800" style="s2">tell it&#39;s it&#39;s done and I would would</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.439" end="00:13:54.050" style="s2">like to ask you or you take about on</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.800" end="00:13:58.220" style="s2">gender science and all these like ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.050" end="00:14:00.800" style="s2">studies and because I was a sociology</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.220" end="00:14:04.699" style="s2">student back in 2004 and I was 22 years</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:07.850" style="s2">old and so a lot of these perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.699" end="00:14:11.179" style="s2">we were taught post-modernism and queer</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.850" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">queer feminism and all all these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.179" end="00:14:16.040" style="s2">and and it was I mean I was just</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:18.199" style="s2">starting out as a student so I but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.040" end="00:14:20.679" style="s2">must have been wired faulty because he</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.199" end="00:14:24.379" style="s2">didn&#39;t I was very critical about it but</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.679" end="00:14:29.660" style="s2">but all those perspectives was was back</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.379" end="00:14:31.389" style="s2">then was fringe in Sweetman so like like</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.660" end="00:14:33.290" style="s2">identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.389" end="00:14:37.220" style="s2">everything that&#39;s now in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.290" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">was at the institution back then and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.220" end="00:14:43.629" style="s2">professor&#39;s they were they are the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:46.819" style="s2">I mean and they are now it&#39;s their their</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.629" end="00:14:50.990" style="s2">PhDs and master students that are taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.819" end="00:14:53.629" style="s2">over the the public discourse so even</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.990" end="00:14:55.670" style="s2">though they lost a lot of debates back</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.629" end="00:14:59.660" style="s2">then and they still do like public</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.670" end="00:15:04.220" style="s2">debates they&#39;re still teaching students</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.660" end="00:15:06.499" style="s2">year after year of the year might ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.220" end="00:15:09.679" style="s2">you about that and like oh and also</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.499" end="00:15:11.929" style="s2">about your fatigue of gender the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.679" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">understudies in Swedish it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.929" end="00:15:17.689" style="s2">gender science because we turn all this</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:21.139" style="s2">into science oh yeah so it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.689" end="00:15:23.899" style="s2">studies it&#39;s science here that was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.139" end="00:15:26.929" style="s2">good move on on on the ideologues parts</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.899" end="00:15:30.230" style="s2">that&#39;s free-weight this mode so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.929" end="00:15:32.450" style="s2">two-pronged question but</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.230" end="00:15:34.459" style="s2">yeah well I think well I listed about</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.450" end="00:15:36.579" style="s2">seven things I think that are killing</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.459" end="00:15:39.380" style="s2">the universities I actually think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.579" end="00:15:42.260" style="s2">like I&#39;ve watched major institutions</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.380" end="00:15:44.089" style="s2">collapse and be privy to the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.260" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">which that occurs like what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.089" end="00:15:49.820" style="s2">that as the enterprise pathologize is</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:51.139" style="s2">the good people leave the people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.820" end="00:15:53.149" style="s2">have other things that they could do</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.139" end="00:15:56.029" style="s2">they leave first those are the most</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.149" end="00:15:57.829" style="s2">productive and and talented people as</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.029" end="00:15:59.660" style="s2">soon as the most productive leave then</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.829" end="00:16:01.370" style="s2">the bloody thing just spirals downhill</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.660" end="00:16:04.459" style="s2">because what what&#39;s gonna happen you</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.370" end="00:16:06.050" style="s2">you&#39;ve you know because the rule is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.459" end="00:16:08.300" style="s2">that within a certain discipline</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.050" end="00:16:09.800" style="s2">whatever it happens to be the square</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.300" end="00:16:11.389" style="s2">root of the number of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.800" end="00:16:14.930" style="s2">discipline produce half the productive</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.389" end="00:16:18.170" style="s2">work so if a university has let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.930" end="00:16:22.010" style="s2">thousand professors thirty of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.170" end="00:16:23.269" style="s2">produce half the publications right</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.010" end="00:16:24.050" style="s2">which is staggering right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.269" end="00:16:26.930" style="s2">staggering</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.050" end="00:16:30.459" style="s2">that&#39;s the kirino distribution or prices</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.930" end="00:16:32.990" style="s2">law and so and those people are often</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.459" end="00:16:34.550" style="s2">have more opportunities than they know</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.990" end="00:16:36.170" style="s2">what to do with and so as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.550" end="00:16:37.850" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re doing becomes unstable</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.170" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like they go off and do other</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.850" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">things and then then the institution</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:46.040" style="s2">loses its most productive people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:49.339" style="s2">that&#39;s it it&#39;s done it can&#39;t recover</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.040" end="00:16:54.500" style="s2">from that and so and the introduction of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.339" end="00:16:57.380" style="s2">these so-called science disciplines that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.500" end="00:17:01.100" style="s2">we call studies disciplines you know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.380" end="00:17:02.779" style="s2">was a market lowering of standards it</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.100" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">involved a market lowering of academic</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.779" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">standards a blurring of what actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">constitute a discipline refusal</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:12.949" style="s2">whatsoever to consider anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:14.780" style="s2">methodological rigorous cuz anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.949" end="00:17:19.069" style="s2">goes including author what do they call</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.780" end="00:17:20.809" style="s2">that off no Auto ethnography which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.069" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">where you just write a diary essentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.809" end="00:17:25.069" style="s2">about your own experiences that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:27.400" style="s2">this fancy name so Auto ethnography as</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.069" end="00:17:31.450" style="s2">part of gender science you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.400" end="00:17:31.450" style="s2">positively Orwellian and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.210" end="00:17:36.529" style="s2">it&#39;s and the other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.369" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">interesting about that is that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.529" end="00:17:41.029" style="s2">happened is that the people who have</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:43.399" style="s2">these radical viewpoints have been given</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.029" end="00:17:46.600" style="s2">a permanent signing here right there</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.399" end="00:17:49.700" style="s2">they&#39;re their state and tuition</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.600" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">sponsored activists who can spend every</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.700" end="00:17:55.850" style="s2">single moment of their time on what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.940" style="s2">would consider their Fifth Column agenda</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.850" end="00:18:01.519" style="s2">so we&#39;re basically funding a cohort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:05.570" style="s2">people whose stated purpose is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.519" end="00:18:07.519" style="s2">demolish the patriarchy you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.570" end="00:18:09.289" style="s2">the things Carl Jung said which I really</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.519" end="00:18:12.440" style="s2">liked and haven&#39;t talked about that much</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.289" end="00:18:15.230" style="s2">is that the unconscious representation</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.440" end="00:18:18.919" style="s2">of men in the female psyche he called</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.230" end="00:18:20.539" style="s2">the animus and the animus was always in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.919" end="00:18:22.549" style="s2">his estimation because of the dream</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.539" end="00:18:25.100" style="s2">analysis he did and so forth that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.549" end="00:18:26.869" style="s2">although the unconscious representation</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.100" end="00:18:28.669" style="s2">of a woman in a man&#39;s psyche was an</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.869" end="00:18:31.490" style="s2">individual woman the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.669" end="00:18:34.009" style="s2">representation of the male psyche in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.490" end="00:18:37.850" style="s2">female unconscious was men as a group</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.009" end="00:18:41.389" style="s2">and there&#39;s a very large number of women</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.850" end="00:18:46.220" style="s2">and and also some men whose conception</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.389" end="00:18:49.220" style="s2">of maleness is has been damaged very</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.220" end="00:18:50.929" style="s2">badly by their failure to establish any</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.220" end="00:18:52.340" style="s2">positive relationship with any male</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.929" end="00:18:54.799" style="s2">whatsoever in their developmental</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.340" end="00:18:56.929" style="s2">history and then they project this</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:18:59.330" style="s2">paranoid representation of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.929" end="00:19:03.080" style="s2">constitutes hierarchical masculinity on</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.330" end="00:19:06.230" style="s2">to the world and then fight to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.080" end="00:19:08.779" style="s2">down and it&#39;s and the thing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.230" end="00:19:12.529" style="s2">being successful that&#39;s the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.779" end="00:19:14.899" style="s2">this is this is this is another what</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.529" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">when I was actually I know that you were</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.899" end="00:19:20.600" style="s2">very popular with a lot of young men but</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:25.519" style="s2">I was actually introduced to you by a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.600" end="00:19:29.749" style="s2">mother of two so professor in education</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.519" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">so he&#39;s really she&#39;s not dinner at home</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.749" end="00:19:38.659" style="s2">so to speak ideologically or but one</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:43.460" style="s2">thing that that&#39;s worrying me is the I</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.659" end="00:19:46.010" style="s2">mean there are certain certain reports</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.460" end="00:19:50.090" style="s2">of idea certain ideologies that take</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.010" end="00:19:52.730" style="s2">religious overtones and you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.090" end="00:19:54.020" style="s2">think that the feminism has some of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.730" end="00:19:56.390" style="s2">those characteristics I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.020" end="00:19:57.650" style="s2">Christianity we&#39;re all born sinful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.390" end="00:19:59.690" style="s2">we need to come to grips with our</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.650" end="00:20:01.990" style="s2">sinfulness and in the end only God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.690" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">grace and forgiveness can redeem us and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.990" end="00:20:08.419" style="s2">in Lutheranism at least it&#39;s we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:11.059" style="s2">can we can&#39;t be forgiven by priests it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.419" end="00:20:12.230" style="s2">only god yeah yeah it&#39;s a doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.059" end="00:20:15.890" style="s2">there&#39;s no escape</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.230" end="00:20:18.350" style="s2">Rob and I totally sympathize it with it</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.890" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">even though I I don&#39;t in a little ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.350" end="00:20:25.070" style="s2">but I realized but but within feminism</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">the sin is situated within males instead</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.070" end="00:20:30.500" style="s2">so not only with within males but within</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:32.390" style="s2">males as a collective you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.500" end="00:20:34.549" style="s2">even see the thing about the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.390" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">doctrine that you referred to is that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.549" end="00:20:39.590" style="s2">makes each individual responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">their own darkness now the Catholics say</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.590" end="00:20:43.070" style="s2">look that&#39;s unbearable and people need</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:44.900" style="s2">to have the slate wiped clean now and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.070" end="00:20:46.970" style="s2">then and confession will do that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.900" end="00:20:49.820" style="s2">there&#39;s an intermediary and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.970" end="00:20:51.559" style="s2">considered that merciful and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.820" end="00:20:53.240" style="s2">some real power in that argument you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.559" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">know that the cynical argument is well</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.240" end="00:20:57.080" style="s2">you can just wipe the slate clean at any</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:20:58.669" style="s2">time and you don&#39;t have to bear any</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.080" end="00:21:00.919" style="s2">responsibility but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.669" end="00:21:02.419" style="s2">cynical the Protestants put themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.919" end="00:21:05.660" style="s2">in a much tougher position because</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.419" end="00:21:07.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no escape and but the upside of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.660" end="00:21:10.820" style="s2">all of that is is that the darkness is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.640" end="00:21:12.860" style="s2">to be regarded as within not without and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.820" end="00:21:15.590" style="s2">yeah and as soon as you move away from</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.860" end="00:21:18.049" style="s2">that then while you&#39;re you&#39;re the good</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.590" end="00:21:20.330" style="s2">person and so is everyone that thinks</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.049" end="00:21:23.480" style="s2">like you and all the evil is wherever</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.330" end="00:21:25.160" style="s2">you want to put it and and then as soon</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.480" end="00:21:27.260" style="s2">as the thing that&#39;s really dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.160" end="00:21:30.340" style="s2">about that especially if evil is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.260" end="00:21:33.799" style="s2">conceptualized as contemptible and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.340" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">parasitic and and using disgust related</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.799" end="00:21:39.070" style="s2">language for example instead of fear</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:44.350" style="s2">related language then the logical</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.070" end="00:21:47.540" style="s2">directive is to purify it and boy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.350" end="00:21:52.309" style="s2">that&#39;s not good and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.540" end="00:21:54.260" style="s2">that I think is happening if I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.309" end="00:21:56.750" style="s2">some a dissertation about how male</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.260" end="00:21:59.419" style="s2">feminists think about themselves and how</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.750" end="00:22:01.369" style="s2">they go about having sex for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.419" end="00:22:04.369" style="s2">and one of the men said that he&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.369" end="00:22:06.889" style="s2">way to approach sex was that he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.369" end="00:22:10.789" style="s2">take any initiative because he he would</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.889" end="00:22:12.289" style="s2">defile the defile that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.789" end="00:22:14.269" style="s2">situation and the woman</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.289" end="00:22:16.609" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s like Andrea Dworkin a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.269" end="00:22:18.919" style="s2">back in the 70s that horrible she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.609" end="00:22:23.119" style="s2">horrible creature or Andrea Dworkin</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.919" end="00:22:25.999" style="s2">and you know she said that if men</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.119" end="00:22:28.909" style="s2">engaged in sexual behavior with an erect</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.999" end="00:22:30.709" style="s2">penis that that was that that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.909" end="00:22:34.269" style="s2">equivalent to violence right that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.709" end="00:22:36.619" style="s2">equivalent to rape well so I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.269" end="00:22:39.829" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.619" end="00:22:41.599" style="s2">except that that&#39;s exactly what Andrea</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.829" end="00:22:43.669" style="s2">Dworkin was like and she was a real</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.599" end="00:22:45.529" style="s2">heroine to the radical feminists you</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.669" end="00:22:47.599" style="s2">know her and was someone else around</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.529" end="00:22:50.200" style="s2">that period of time and rude Catherine</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.599" end="00:22:54.259" style="s2">MacKinnon I think her name was equally</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.200" end="00:22:59.899" style="s2">equally well I think I read a book you</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.259" end="00:23:01.579" style="s2">know yeah well you yeah yeah I mean from</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.899" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">my perspective as a clinician those</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.579" end="00:23:06.200" style="s2">people have clear every indication of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:08.299" style="s2">serious personality disorders and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.200" end="00:23:11.989" style="s2">actually think to some degree that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.299" end="00:23:15.099" style="s2">made a haven for people who have serious</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.989" end="00:23:17.690" style="s2">personality pathology in these in these</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.099" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">pseudo disciplines in the universities</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.690" end="00:23:21.529" style="s2">and you know you said something</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:23.659" style="s2">interesting you said that you know when</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.529" end="00:23:25.129" style="s2">you went to - when you took your</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.659" end="00:23:26.719" style="s2">sociology degree that these were</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.129" end="00:23:28.759" style="s2">basically fringe views now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.719" end="00:23:30.829" style="s2">Center views in the university but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.759" end="00:23:33.589" style="s2">implying that they&#39;re increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.829" end="00:23:35.719" style="s2">dominant views in society and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.589" end="00:23:37.969" style="s2">thing is that people think that these</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.719" end="00:23:40.070" style="s2">are somehow ivory tower arguments but</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.969" end="00:23:42.469" style="s2">what happens in the universities happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.070" end="00:23:44.269" style="s2">in society five to ten years later and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.469" end="00:23:49.369" style="s2">so and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.269" end="00:23:52.339" style="s2">right now so and and well I think this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.369" end="00:23:56.450" style="s2">this leads us into that me to debate for</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.339" end="00:24:00.200" style="s2">that because you have people in swing</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.450" end="00:24:02.869" style="s2">right now I think the me - phenomenon is</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.200" end="00:24:05.599" style="s2">much larger in swing than in any other</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.869" end="00:24:08.710" style="s2">country I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s dominated the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.599" end="00:24:16.129" style="s2">media for one month now and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.710" end="00:24:19.639" style="s2">every profession has a claim has an me</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.129" end="00:24:23.479" style="s2">to sort of article with thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.639" end="00:24:28.549" style="s2">women signing onto it so the teachers</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.479" end="00:24:31.159" style="s2">and the lawyers and doctors so but what</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.549" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">one thing is interesting about this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.159" end="00:24:40.099" style="s2">how the men are handling it because</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:42.950" style="s2">there are a lot of men writing that I as</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.099" end="00:24:45.469" style="s2">a man have a responsibility for this</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.950" end="00:24:49.849" style="s2">happening I as a man as a male am</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.469" end="00:24:51.979" style="s2">responsible and I&#39;m guilty and actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.849" end="00:24:53.539" style="s2">it was one so there&#39;s a lot of articles</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.979" end="00:24:54.950" style="s2">like that and then one of them one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.539" end="00:24:57.339" style="s2">the men that was accused of doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.950" end="00:25:00.049" style="s2">something inappropriate it was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.339" end="00:25:04.070" style="s2">former reportedly before the left</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.049" end="00:25:06.169" style="s2">radical party and the thing he had done</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.070" end="00:25:09.710" style="s2">was was not so reprehensible he had</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.169" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">approached a woman and then she had said</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.710" end="00:25:14.659" style="s2">no and he had apologized but then she</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.639" style="s2">didn&#39;t accept that and no no he&#39;s under</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.659" end="00:25:19.789" style="s2">investigation police investigation and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.639" end="00:25:24.019" style="s2">we have this sort of witch hunt going</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.789" end="00:25:26.059" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought of this is that almost all</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.019" end="00:25:27.710" style="s2">men of all manifestations of male</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.059" end="00:25:30.109" style="s2">sexuality are going to be brought under</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.710" end="00:25:32.809" style="s2">legal control and he actually wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.109" end="00:25:35.509" style="s2">article that said yes I am responsible</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.809" end="00:25:37.849" style="s2">and because I say I am responsible I am</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.509" end="00:25:39.950" style="s2">better than the majority of men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.849" end="00:25:41.989" style="s2">reactions to this so actually he turned</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.950" end="00:25:44.239" style="s2">the thing that he was being under</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.989" end="00:25:46.190" style="s2">investigation into because he showed</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.239" end="00:25:46.849" style="s2">that because he admitted he showed that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.190" end="00:25:51.559" style="s2">he was better</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.849" end="00:25:53.359" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s very powers day I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.559" end="00:25:55.609" style="s2">whole idea was that you were supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.359" end="00:25:58.609" style="s2">come to terms with your class guilt and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.609" end="00:26:00.139" style="s2">then confess and then and then indicate</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.609" end="00:26:02.450" style="s2">that you could be brought back into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.139" end="00:26:03.979" style="s2">ideological fold properly the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.450" end="00:26:05.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of muddy thinking it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.979" end="00:26:08.839" style="s2">well men should take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.960" end="00:26:10.759" style="s2">their aggressive sexuality and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.839" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">should incorporate it right because if</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.759" end="00:26:14.690" style="s2">you repress it it just comes out in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:17.659" style="s2">most ugly way so I mean part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.690" end="00:26:19.669" style="s2">ideas that men boys should be socialized</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.659" end="00:26:21.859" style="s2">like little girls you know but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.669" end="00:26:22.250" style="s2">complete rubbish in fact even little</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.859" end="00:26:23.750" style="s2">girls</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.250" end="00:26:25.429" style="s2">perhaps shouldn&#39;t be socialized like</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.750" end="00:26:28.280" style="s2">little girls but whatever I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.429" end="00:26:30.289" style="s2">beside the point that aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.280" end="00:26:32.659" style="s2">capacity that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.289" end="00:26:34.669" style="s2">sexuality as well as Freud pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.659" end="00:26:36.350" style="s2">so long ago needs to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.669" end="00:26:38.539" style="s2">within the personality so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.350" end="00:26:40.309" style="s2">under control right and then it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.539" end="00:26:42.620" style="s2">the hint of darkness and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.309" end="00:26:44.750" style="s2">capacity for malevolence but it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.620" end="00:26:47.510" style="s2">it&#39;s brought under but it&#39;s brought</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.750" end="00:26:48.919" style="s2">under civilized regulation and so then</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.510" end="00:26:51.110" style="s2">you get to have your cake and eat it too</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.919" end="00:26:53.240" style="s2">right you can be strong and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.110" end="00:26:54.950" style="s2">dangerous and mysterious and all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.240" end="00:26:57.049" style="s2">those things that that are definitely</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.950" end="00:26:59.419" style="s2">attractive that there are attractive</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.049" end="00:27:02.929" style="s2">features of men not only to women but</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.419" end="00:27:04.850" style="s2">also to other men so you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.929" end="00:27:06.679" style="s2">responsibility for that but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.850" end="00:27:08.840" style="s2">mean that you should identify yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.679" end="00:27:11.780" style="s2">as the member of a guilty group because</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.840" end="00:27:15.020" style="s2">of a class-based accusation right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.780" end="00:27:17.780" style="s2">just you&#39;re not guilty as the member of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.020" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">a class I mean that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.780" end="00:27:21.950" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been pushing so hard against</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:23.299" style="s2">these postmodern neo-marxist ideas</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.950" end="00:27:25.970" style="s2">because one of their essential</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.299" end="00:27:28.750" style="s2">predicates is that you can be guilty as</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.970" end="00:27:30.770" style="s2">the member of a class and that is I</p>

<p begin="00:31:22.950" end="00:31:31.350" style="s2">well they that small proportion commit</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.440" end="00:31:32.340" style="s2">all of the sexual predation like if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.350" end="00:31:35.850" style="s2">look at criminals</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.340" end="00:31:38.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a Pareto distribution again five</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.850" end="00:31:41.399" style="s2">percent of the criminals produce</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.340" end="00:31:43.350" style="s2">something like well the overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.399" end="00:31:45.990" style="s2">majority of the crimes right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.350" end="00:31:47.759" style="s2">small coterie of specialized people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.990" end="00:31:49.470" style="s2">are responsible for all the criminality</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.759" end="00:31:51.750" style="s2">lots of people are in prison because</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:54.779" style="s2">they did one Highness thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.750" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">like they got enraged or drunk and did</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.779" end="00:31:59.340" style="s2">something violent but there&#39;s the serial</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">criminal types and they&#39;re the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.340" end="00:32:03.990" style="s2">are they do all they they like we had</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:06.570" style="s2">one guy in Toronto for example who ran a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.990" end="00:32:09.539" style="s2">bike theft ring and they finally nailed</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.570" end="00:32:12.059" style="s2">him and like there weren&#39;t any bikes</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.539" end="00:32:14.639" style="s2">stolen in Toronto after that it was just</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.059" end="00:32:17.009" style="s2">him and his a coterie of you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.639" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">organized bike thieves and these guys</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.009" end="00:32:23.159" style="s2">that are being outed these serial</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">predators they are responsible like one</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.159" end="00:32:29.970" style="s2">one spreaded predatory guy can prey on</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:34.379" style="s2">who knows 500 females thousand females</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.970" end="00:32:39.380" style="s2">in a lifetime you know so it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.379" end="00:32:42.049" style="s2">seems like I mean this is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.380" end="00:32:44.110" style="s2">guys I was one of these guys who sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.049" end="00:32:47.990" style="s2">turned away from society for for a while</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.110" end="00:32:51.860" style="s2">like into computer games and like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.990" end="00:32:54.860" style="s2">slacker identity where which is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.860" end="00:32:58.250" style="s2">I guess it&#39;s always been there like you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.860" end="00:33:00.470" style="s2">to turn to like away from all</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.250" end="00:33:02.870" style="s2">responsibilities and go with the dream</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.470" end="00:33:05.299" style="s2">world but the opportunities to do this</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.870" end="00:33:07.220" style="s2">it&#39;s so much larger knowledge yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.299" end="00:33:09.860" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the lost voice like in Peter</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.220" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">Pan right there in Neverland and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.860" end="00:33:15.500" style="s2">never grow up and Peter Pan is their</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">leader that&#39;s that&#39;s the story and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.500" end="00:33:20.750" style="s2">not surprising because it&#39;s easier to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:22.909" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to occupy yourself trivially</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.750" end="00:33:25.159" style="s2">than it is to do something difficult so</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.909" end="00:33:27.320" style="s2">like there&#39;s a big tendency in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.159" end="00:33:28.580" style="s2">direction to begin with because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.320" end="00:33:31.250" style="s2">easier to do nothing than to take</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.580" end="00:33:33.650" style="s2">responsibility it&#39;s easier to play games</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.250" end="00:33:36.230" style="s2">than to plan for the future it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.650" end="00:33:38.900" style="s2">to be resentful and and angry than it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.230" end="00:33:40.820" style="s2">to be you know to shoulder your</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.900" end="00:33:44.150" style="s2">vulnerability properly and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.820" end="00:33:46.010" style="s2">add on to that the idea that if you go</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.150" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">out into the world and try to strive</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.010" end="00:33:54.500" style="s2">forward that you&#39;re nothing but a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:56.659" style="s2">predatory patriarch then well it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.500" end="00:33:58.520" style="s2">one more it&#39;s just the icing on the cake</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.659" end="00:34:02.980" style="s2">you know I had a friend who was like</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.520" end="00:34:05.720" style="s2">that he pulled back from the world and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.980" end="00:34:09.310" style="s2">Billiton because he believed that active</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.720" end="00:34:12.169" style="s2">masculinity was a pathological force and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.310" end="00:34:13.730" style="s2">he poisoned himself terribly because of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.169" end="00:34:16.909" style="s2">that and he committed suicide when he</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.730" end="00:34:19.100" style="s2">was 40 he hooked an exhaust you know a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.909" end="00:34:20.869" style="s2">hose onto his exhaust pipe and gassed</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.100" end="00:34:24.080" style="s2">himself up in the mountains in Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.869" end="00:34:27.649" style="s2">and that was the logical consequence of</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.649" end="00:34:31.909" style="s2">so pathological why don&#39;t you just do</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.419" end="00:34:34.100" style="s2">yourself in and hiding like that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.909" end="00:34:35.929" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not that&#39;s obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.100" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">the full-fledged manifestation of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.929" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">but but it&#39;s it&#39;s leave me it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:44.929" style="s2">road so and so yeah I&#39;ve been talking to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:46.700" style="s2">all these young guys they come to my</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.929" end="00:34:48.169" style="s2">biblical lectures for example and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.700" end="00:34:50.570" style="s2">message is always the same it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.169" end="00:34:53.210" style="s2">stand the hell up get the hell out there</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.570" end="00:34:55.869" style="s2">in the world take local</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.210" end="00:34:58.160" style="s2">responsibility put yourself together</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.869" end="00:35:01.790" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.160" end="00:35:03.470" style="s2">than a weak man and the problem is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.790" end="00:35:06.500" style="s2">that we&#39;re encouraging men to be weak</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.470" end="00:35:09.380" style="s2">because we have this pathological idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.500" end="00:35:11.390" style="s2">that there&#39;s that strength and tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.380" end="00:35:12.770" style="s2">are the same thing and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.390" end="00:35:16.280" style="s2">animus I was talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.770" end="00:35:19.550" style="s2">though women it&#39;s not only women but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.280" end="00:35:22.040" style="s2">feminist types let&#39;s say who insist upon</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.550" end="00:35:25.930" style="s2">the pathology of the patriarchy cannot</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.040" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">distinguish between competence and power</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.930" end="00:35:31.250" style="s2">they see everything because they they</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:34.070" style="s2">have this vague and undifferentiated</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.250" end="00:35:36.369" style="s2">sense of masculinity they say they see</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.070" end="00:35:39.859" style="s2">everything that is associated with</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.369" end="00:35:41.900" style="s2">Authority as equivalent to tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.859" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">failing to understand completely that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.900" end="00:35:46.910" style="s2">Authority in a properly function society</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">is based on competence they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.910" end="00:35:51.740" style="s2">believe in confidence anyways you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:53.930" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the whole postmodern yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.740" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">that&#39;s just a coaster to keep power yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.930" end="00:35:57.589" style="s2">exactly well everything&#39;s about power</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:02.119" style="s2">for the bloody post modernists and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.589" end="00:36:05.450" style="s2">also excuses their use of power yes and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.119" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">this is I mean in Sweden we have girls</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.450" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">have always outperformed boys in school</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:13.160" style="s2">ever since we started having schools in</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:14.599" style="s2">the 19th century in the middle 19th</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.160" end="00:36:17.540" style="s2">century girls have been outperforming</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.599" end="00:36:21.530" style="s2">boys and being better at sitting quietly</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.540" end="00:36:21.980" style="s2">in a classroom but the the last 20-30</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.530" end="00:36:24.200" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.980" end="00:36:27.080" style="s2">the divide between girls and boys is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.200" end="00:36:28.790" style="s2">widening Sweden it&#39;s widening in other</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.080" end="00:36:31.099" style="s2">countries too but in Sweden it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.790" end="00:36:33.550" style="s2">it&#39;s really you guys you guys are ahead</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.099" end="00:36:36.859" style="s2">of the curve so congratulations on that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.550" end="00:36:37.430" style="s2">so I&#39;m proud about this I&#39;m not so proud</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.859" end="00:36:42.650" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.430" end="00:36:44.089" style="s2">but so and actually when you talk to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.650" end="00:36:47.270" style="s2">people in swimming they&#39;re more worried</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.089" end="00:36:50.510" style="s2">about bringing up boys than bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.270" end="00:36:52.430" style="s2">girls nowadays because girls they can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.510" end="00:36:53.150" style="s2">girls or they can be like boys yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.430" end="00:36:56.630" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.150" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">the boys are problem boys and and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.630" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">have that feeling we didn&#39;t like boys</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:04.790" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">yep boys should perhaps be like more</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.790" end="00:37:09.170" style="s2">like girls but they should</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:10.490" style="s2">definitely will not be like boys they</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.170" end="00:37:12.290" style="s2">should not play war they should not</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.490" end="00:37:14.330" style="s2">compete so much well the competition</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.290" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">thing is really interesting because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.330" end="00:37:19.250" style="s2">the people who are who are hyper</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:21.590" style="s2">cooperative you know regard competition</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.250" end="00:37:23.240" style="s2">as a positive evil without understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.590" end="00:37:24.760" style="s2">without they they have no understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.240" end="00:37:27.050" style="s2">whatsoever of developmental psychology</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.760" end="00:37:29.720" style="s2">you know one of the things I really like</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.050" end="00:37:31.490" style="s2">John Piaget and you know one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.720" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">intelligent things he ever said about</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.490" end="00:37:36.140" style="s2">children&#39;s games competitive games was</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">that the competition is nested inside a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.140" end="00:37:41.060" style="s2">higher order structure of cooperation so</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:42.680" style="s2">you think about a hockey game we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.060" end="00:37:46.010" style="s2">talk about that because we&#39;re Swedes and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.680" end="00:37:48.200" style="s2">Canadians don&#39;t you say well are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.010" end="00:37:49.820" style="s2">hockey players competing or cooperating</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.200" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">and the answer is what you have to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.820" end="00:37:54.440" style="s2">micro analysis so fundamentally they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:56.840" style="s2">cooperating because they all agree to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.440" end="00:37:59.420" style="s2">abide by the same set of rules</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.840" end="00:38:02.330" style="s2">so they occupy the same perceptual space</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.420" end="00:38:04.220" style="s2">they occupy the same value space because</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.330" end="00:38:05.900" style="s2">the value is score goals and win the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.220" end="00:38:07.880" style="s2">game so that provides the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.900" end="00:38:10.100" style="s2">frame so fundamentally they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.880" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">cooperating now within that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.100" end="00:38:15.740" style="s2">competing because it&#39;s team against team</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:19.070" style="s2">and even within a team it&#39;s individuals</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.740" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">vying for let&#39;s say it athletic</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.070" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2">supremacy but it&#39;s also more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:28.010" style="s2">than that because a hockey isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:30.920" style="s2">game it&#39;s a sequence of iterated games</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.010" end="00:38:34.280" style="s2">and the proper strategy is if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.920" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">individual athlete is to adopt a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.280" end="00:38:38.690" style="s2">strategy that makes you a victor across</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:40.550" style="s2">iterated games and that means you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.690" end="00:38:43.070" style="s2">to cooperate with your teammates and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.550" end="00:38:45.530" style="s2">even with the with the other team if</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.070" end="00:38:47.750" style="s2">you&#39;re going to sustain your career</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.530" end="00:38:49.490" style="s2">across time you know so you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.750" end="00:38:52.390" style="s2">honorable very honorable hockey players</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.490" end="00:38:54.680" style="s2">say like Wayne Gretzky who were</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.390" end="00:38:56.780" style="s2">unbelievably stellar in their individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.680" end="00:38:59.300" style="s2">performance but also great team players</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.780" end="00:39:01.790" style="s2">and inspirations to those who played</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.300" end="00:39:03.350" style="s2">against them perfect you know it so</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.790" end="00:39:05.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good example of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.350" end="00:39:07.970" style="s2">well-developed masculinity and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.360" end="00:39:11.810" style="s2">all shunted off into pathological</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.970" end="00:39:14.260" style="s2">competition by fools who are motivated</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.810" end="00:39:16.490" style="s2">by hatred and resentment and who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.260" end="00:39:20.539" style="s2">willfully blind to the complexities of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.490" end="00:39:23.059" style="s2">the situation so it&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.539" end="00:39:24.949" style="s2">it really is the rise of the like of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.059" end="00:39:27.109" style="s2">of the the goddess of the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.949" end="00:39:33.979" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the right way to think</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.109" end="00:39:36.199" style="s2">about it and I mean this is also I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.979" end="00:39:38.179" style="s2">like to move on to discussing myths and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.199" end="00:39:39.739" style="s2">God a little bit but this is so</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.179" end="00:39:43.549" style="s2">interesting so I would just say one more</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.739" end="00:39:45.019" style="s2">ask one more thing because I if you if</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.549" end="00:39:47.989" style="s2">you talk to these people about how you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.019" end="00:39:49.579" style="s2">can reconstruct homosexuals I mean can</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.989" end="00:39:51.559" style="s2">you said can you send them to a straight</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.579" end="00:39:54.979" style="s2">camp I mean all of them would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.559" end="00:39:57.169" style="s2">horrible but if you ask about how came</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.979" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">deconstruct and then reconstruct boys</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.169" end="00:40:02.749" style="s2">and their masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">all of them are aboard so yeah it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.749" end="00:40:10.279" style="s2">of the yeah it&#39;s a very inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.109" style="s2">well I mean one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.279" end="00:40:15.199" style="s2">complained about last year with regards</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.109" end="00:40:19.609" style="s2">to this bill CCC 16 legislation in</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.199" end="00:40:21.949" style="s2">Canada as I said look you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.609" end="00:40:25.249" style="s2">instantiating a social constructionist</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.949" end="00:40:27.049" style="s2">view of gender gender expression sexual</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.249" end="00:40:29.569" style="s2">proclivity all of these things into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.049" end="00:40:33.229" style="s2">law okay so it&#39;s socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.569" end="00:40:37.249" style="s2">okay so wake up the Conservatives who</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.229" end="00:40:40.069" style="s2">have been opposing homosexuality for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.249" end="00:40:42.709" style="s2">last hundred years have used nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.069" end="00:40:45.169" style="s2">social constructionist arguments they</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.709" end="00:40:46.849" style="s2">basically say well if it&#39;s socially</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.169" end="00:40:48.919" style="s2">constructed or an individual choice</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.849" end="00:40:51.469" style="s2">which is by the way now it&#39;s tan she</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.919" end="00:40:53.569" style="s2">ated into Canadian law then why the hell</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.469" end="00:40:55.849" style="s2">can&#39;t you just be re-educated out of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.569" end="00:40:59.299" style="s2">or just drop it if it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.849" end="00:41:03.169" style="s2">individual choice well I tried to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.299" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re playing with fire the fire</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.169" end="00:41:11.380" style="s2">that will consume you well but you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:13.789" style="s2">nobody nobody no I shouldn&#39;t say nobody</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.380" end="00:41:16.549" style="s2">you know these arguments are these</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.789" end="00:41:20.749" style="s2">arguments are subtle and and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.549" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">easy to follow and so and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.749" end="00:41:24.739" style="s2">is that the consequences of producing</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:28.459" style="s2">legislation like that unfold over</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.739" end="00:41:29.989" style="s2">decades not minutes so I don&#39;t know did</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.459" end="00:41:32.599" style="s2">you see what happened yet Wilfred</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.989" end="00:41:34.260" style="s2">Laurier University in Canada last week</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.599" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">two weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.260" end="00:41:39.810" style="s2">Lindsay Shepard does that ring a bell</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">and I listen to the conversation she</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.810" end="00:41:45.170" style="s2">recorded yeah so in Canada now three</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:47.730" style="s2">things are happening the first is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.170" end="00:41:50.490" style="s2">despite the fact that I predicted this</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.730" end="00:41:53.490" style="s2">and that the only reason my reputation</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.490" end="00:41:54.870" style="s2">was ever let&#39;s say tarnished was because</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.490" end="00:41:57.270" style="s2">I predicted that this was going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.870" end="00:42:00.930" style="s2">happen I&#39;m still being vilified by</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.270" end="00:42:02.550" style="s2">people who even who who are admitting</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.930" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">nonetheless that what happened at</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.550" end="00:42:07.370" style="s2">wilfred laurier was reprehensible okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:11.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing the second thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.370" end="00:42:13.680" style="s2">the people at Laurier who used who</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.160" end="00:42:16.170" style="s2">accused lindsay of breaking the canadian</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:18.210" style="s2">federal and provincial laws are being</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.170" end="00:42:20.070" style="s2">accused of misinterpreting those laws</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.210" end="00:42:21.870" style="s2">which they aren&#39;t as far as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.070" end="00:42:26.780" style="s2">concerned but that enables people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.870" end="00:42:29.750" style="s2">save face and third and most dreadfully</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.780" end="00:42:32.220" style="s2">fair number of faculty members and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.750" end="00:42:35.010" style="s2">public commentators are claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.220" end="00:42:36.890" style="s2">rambu khanna and Pimlott and joel who</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.010" end="00:42:40.710" style="s2">were the interlocutors in the</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.710" end="00:42:45.540" style="s2">really oh absolutely because now now</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.530" end="00:42:47.340" style="s2">that people have been well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.540" end="00:42:50.250" style="s2">they were only standing up for trans</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.340" end="00:42:52.830" style="s2">rights and second well because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.250" end="00:42:57.450" style="s2">been the target of substantial criticism</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.830" end="00:43:02.220" style="s2">let&#39;s say like overwhelming punishing</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.450" end="00:43:04.770" style="s2">brutal criticism unending for weeks well</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.220" end="00:43:06.980" style="s2">they&#39;re that they&#39;re now victims because</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.770" end="00:43:09.740" style="s2">that&#39;s just not fair and so when the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.980" end="00:43:12.780" style="s2">president of wilfred laurier university</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.740" end="00:43:16.110" style="s2">apologized to lindsay Shepherd</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.110" end="00:43:20.430" style="s2">also feel that what has happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.330" end="00:43:22.290" style="s2">faculty members in the aftermath of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.430" end="00:43:25.290" style="s2">faculty members and administrators was</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.290" end="00:43:27.360" style="s2">also wrong it&#39;s like it&#39;s that typical</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.290" end="00:43:30.300" style="s2">thing you know you see this when kids</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.200" end="00:43:40.290" style="s2">they&#39;re blind humanitarian impulses</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.430" end="00:43:42.060" style="s2">bring the bully and the victim into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.290" end="00:43:46.779" style="s2">principal&#39;s office to discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.060" end="00:43:48.369" style="s2">assuming equal equal causal</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.779" end="00:43:49.569" style="s2">what would you call responsibility on</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.369" end="00:43:51.400" style="s2">the part of the victim and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.569" end="00:43:55.319" style="s2">perpetrator and they think that well if</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.400" end="00:43:57.579" style="s2">they just had a nice talk about it then</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.319" end="00:43:59.349" style="s2">wicked could be settled not</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.579" end="00:44:01.900" style="s2">understanding at all that the bully</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.349" end="00:44:03.999" style="s2">who&#39;s let&#39;s say one of these one in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.900" end="00:44:05.409" style="s2">hundred predator types is just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.999" end="00:44:07.839" style="s2">stand on the outside of the school</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.409" end="00:44:09.849" style="s2">ground and wait for the victim to come</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.839" end="00:44:11.799" style="s2">by and just pound the hell out of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.849" end="00:44:13.059" style="s2">because that&#39;s how bullies work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.799" end="00:44:15.189" style="s2">like well we can settle it like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.059" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">reasonable people and it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.189" end="00:44:20.679" style="s2">right you&#39;re so goddamn naive that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:22.449" style="s2">know if evil ever popped out and made a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.679" end="00:44:24.279" style="s2">face at you which it likely will you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.449" end="00:44:25.839" style="s2">be scared into post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.279" end="00:44:27.880" style="s2">disorders so fast you wouldn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.839" end="00:44:32.759" style="s2">hit you and I&#39;ve seen that plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.880" end="00:44:32.759" style="s2">times in my clinical practice so and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.909" end="00:44:40.630" style="s2">yeah all this Lindsey Shepherd that your</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.719" end="00:44:43.209" style="s2">your you know transfer I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.630" end="00:44:45.549" style="s2">about these issues in Sweden as one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.209" end="00:44:49.659" style="s2">the few that&#39;s written about who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.549" end="00:44:52.900" style="s2">an activist and recently I wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.659" end="00:44:55.179" style="s2">how it&#39;s coincides with autism diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.900" end="00:44:57.339" style="s2">so we&#39;re and I think it&#39;s the same in</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.179" end="00:45:01.059" style="s2">the United States limits yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.339" end="00:45:03.729" style="s2">mean the number of of especially young</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.059" end="00:45:06.449" style="s2">women who&#39;s never had any doubts about</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.729" end="00:45:09.999" style="s2">their sexual about their gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.449" end="00:45:12.909" style="s2">but then they find like-minded people</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.999" end="00:45:15.339" style="s2">with problems connecting socially on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.909" end="00:45:18.369" style="s2">internet and all the sudden they decided</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.339" end="00:45:21.609" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m not a woman I&#39;m a man yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.369" end="00:45:24.699" style="s2">they most of them have diagnosis within</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.609" end="00:45:26.499" style="s2">the autism spectrum and to even say this</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.699" end="00:45:30.939" style="s2">and say that this is something we need</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.499" end="00:45:33.849" style="s2">to investigate is sort of transphobic</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.939" end="00:45:37.929" style="s2">because then you&#39;re you&#39;re questioning</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.849" end="00:45:41.169" style="s2">the motives within the person you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.929" end="00:45:43.089" style="s2">so you you you&#39;re basically saying that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.169" end="00:45:44.949" style="s2">it&#39;s not maybe it&#39;s not the gender</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.089" end="00:45:47.229" style="s2">identity you&#39;re feeling that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.949" end="00:45:51.969" style="s2">full trade compliance well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.229" end="00:45:54.279" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s gonna be worse yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.969" end="00:45:57.609" style="s2">well it&#39;s gonna get worse because look</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.279" end="00:46:00.840" style="s2">look here&#39;s the logical fallacy not all</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.609" end="00:46:03.060" style="s2">transsexuals have mental illness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.840" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">but many people with mental illness are</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.060" end="00:46:07.710" style="s2">going to be confused about their</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:09.510" style="s2">identity right so that the pool of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.710" end="00:46:12.840" style="s2">people confused about their identity is</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.510" end="00:46:16.890" style="s2">extraordinarily large now if you produce</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.840" end="00:46:19.050" style="s2">a social fad which is exactly what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.890" end="00:46:21.120" style="s2">doing with gender transformation then</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.050" end="00:46:23.370" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s unstable is going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.120" end="00:46:25.140" style="s2">gravitate very rapidly towards that fad</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.370" end="00:46:27.180" style="s2">that&#39;s happened many times with</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.140" end="00:46:30.050" style="s2">different forms of pathology so for</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.180" end="00:46:32.610" style="s2">example there&#39;s a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.050" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">discovery of the unconscious by an</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.610" end="00:46:36.570" style="s2">existentialist psychotherapist named</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:40.020" style="s2">Omri elenberg a which is a great book</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.570" end="00:46:42.540" style="s2">great book and he tracks the cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.020" end="00:46:46.560" style="s2">recurrence of multiple personality</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.540" end="00:46:49.230" style="s2">disorder over the last 300 years so a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.560" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">case will be reported after everyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.230" end="00:46:52.440" style="s2">forgets about it for a generation or two</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.450" style="s2">a case will be reported and then it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.440" end="00:46:57.210" style="s2">spreads like wildfire and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.450" end="00:46:59.340" style="s2">multiple personality everywhere and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.210" end="00:47:01.770" style="s2">people get skeptical about it and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.340" end="00:47:03.630" style="s2">reports drop off to 0 and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.770" end="00:47:05.580" style="s2">underground again and then three</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.630" end="00:47:07.830" style="s2">generations again somebody reports a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.580" end="00:47:11.940" style="s2">case history and poof up it comes again</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.830" end="00:47:13.380" style="s2">and so the there are these and Carl Yuma</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.940" end="00:47:17.010" style="s2">wrote about this a lot there are these</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.380" end="00:47:19.830" style="s2">psychic epidemics that occur from time</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.010" end="00:47:22.110" style="s2">to time and the same thing happened for</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.830" end="00:47:24.450" style="s2">example in the 1980s when there was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.110" end="00:47:29.160" style="s2">huge outcry in the United States in</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.450" end="00:47:32.340" style="s2">particular about satanic ritual abuse in</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.160" end="00:47:35.790" style="s2">daycares and that produced an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.340" end="00:47:39.050" style="s2">uproar for like five years and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.790" end="00:47:41.460" style="s2">did you have that yeah one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.050" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">professor&#39;s here in uppsala tips on</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.460" end="00:47:47.970" style="s2">University she wrote a book about and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:52.890" style="s2">most men of power were in on it in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.970" end="00:47:56.010" style="s2">husband right and even though it was I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.890" end="00:47:59.450" style="s2">mean it&#39;s blatantly it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.010" end="00:48:03.480" style="s2">yeah but the gender scientists yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.450" end="00:48:08.190" style="s2">because it would criticize it was sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.480" end="00:48:12.180" style="s2">of yeah he she is actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.190" end="00:48:14.200" style="s2">architects behind our how we view men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.180" end="00:48:16.900" style="s2">violence against women</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.200" end="00:48:19.789" style="s2">but you also wrote about these satanic</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.900" end="00:48:23.539" style="s2">rituals that men in power had against</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.789" end="00:48:26.359" style="s2">children but it wasn&#39;t in daycare it was</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.970" end="00:49:33.829" style="s2">because I&#39;m really interested in in in</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.829" end="00:49:40.010" style="s2">thing that&#39;s I mean if you call</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.579" end="00:49:44.299" style="s2">something a myth then it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.010" end="00:49:45.859" style="s2">all it&#39;s not not alive anymore perhaps I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.299" end="00:49:47.480" style="s2">mean if you&#39;re actually calling it a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.859" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">myth if you really believe in it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.480" end="00:49:53.470" style="s2">not believing that it is a myth and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">where we are now we will be studying the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.470" end="00:50:00.529" style="s2">the Bible like scientifically and and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:02.510" style="s2">we construct my first subject in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.529" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">university was really just studies and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.510" end="00:50:08.059" style="s2">then you deconstruct the Bible and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:10.010" style="s2">learn about when everything was great</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.059" end="00:50:15.010" style="s2">and everything but what would you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.010" end="00:50:17.930" style="s2">right now this you sort of you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.010" end="00:50:19.970" style="s2">the Bible in your Bible lectures you</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.930" end="00:50:25.520" style="s2">make it accessible for people that of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.970" end="00:50:27.880" style="s2">our our age or our epoch as a plan yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.520" end="00:50:30.310" style="s2">and people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.880" end="00:50:32.440" style="s2">I don&#39;t think what Matt you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.310" end="00:50:35.800" style="s2">have naturally turned to the Bible for</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.440" end="00:50:37.990" style="s2">counsel well you&#39;re you I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.800" end="00:50:40.660" style="s2">it&#39;s completely it&#39;s just an indication</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.990" end="00:50:42.940" style="s2">of how surreal the current circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.660" end="00:50:45.130" style="s2">really are I&#39;ve been selling out the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.940" end="00:50:47.020" style="s2">theater that I booked in Toronto for</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.130" end="00:50:49.480" style="s2">these biblical lectures and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.020" end="00:50:50.710" style="s2">full of it&#39;s almost all young man like</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.480" end="00:50:52.150" style="s2">they&#39;re not that young you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.710" end="00:50:53.950" style="s2">between say eighteen and thirty</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.150" end="00:50:55.240" style="s2">something like that although they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.950" end="00:50:56.770" style="s2">know there&#39;s women in there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.240" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">older people too but that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.770" end="00:51:00.220" style="s2">audience and it&#39;s like well that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:03.010" style="s2">right that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.220" end="00:51:04.930" style="s2">that that&#39;s happening yeah but but it</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.010" end="00:51:09.100" style="s2">would attempt to relieve fi the myth</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.930" end="00:51:16.450" style="s2">yeah and so what&#39;s your what&#39;s your take</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.100" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">take on why why is I asked Richard</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.450" end="00:51:20.140" style="s2">Dawkins this when I interviewed him like</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:23.170" style="s2">there were people there were worried</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.140" end="00:51:25.540" style="s2">about the post mortem challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.170" end="00:51:27.610" style="s2">everything like like deconstructing</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.540" end="00:51:30.600" style="s2">everything and so you you look for</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.610" end="00:51:33.880" style="s2">something firm in your in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.600" end="00:51:35.860" style="s2">what I see you do is and I would like</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.880" end="00:51:38.170" style="s2">you to your thoughts on it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.860" end="00:51:41.560" style="s2">bring some like affirm you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.170" end="00:51:44.250" style="s2">bring in a sort of a firmer foot tall in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.560" end="00:51:46.840" style="s2">yes exactly that it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.250" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">journeying to the bottom of the ocean to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.840" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">rescue the father from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:53.740" style="s2">fire-breathing whale like that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:56.890" style="s2">yet it&#39;s like the thing is is that when</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.740" end="00:51:59.890" style="s2">everything shakes then you look for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.890" end="00:52:02.770" style="s2">foundation right and to me the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.890" end="00:52:06.010" style="s2">foundation the thing the West got right</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.770" end="00:52:10.270" style="s2">is the divinity of the individual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.010" end="00:52:13.210" style="s2">right it&#39;s true and it&#39;s the myth idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.270" end="00:52:15.070" style="s2">this is partly where I had a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.210" end="00:52:18.550" style="s2">with Sam Harris you know that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.070" end="00:52:20.620" style="s2">a difficult discussion to discussions I</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.550" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in the best of physical health</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.620" end="00:52:23.020" style="s2">when I had them unfortunately but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:26.530" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.020" end="00:52:28.870" style="s2">but you talk when you talk about myths</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.530" end="00:52:31.510" style="s2">you know it sounds like untruth but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.870" end="00:52:34.060" style="s2">think about it sort of as meta truth</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.510" end="00:52:36.550" style="s2">it&#39;s truer than true in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.060" end="00:52:38.920" style="s2">because it consists of abstractions that</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.550" end="00:52:41.500" style="s2">have guided human behavior properly for</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.920" end="00:52:45.670" style="s2">forever insofar as human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.500" end="00:52:47.620" style="s2">being successful and even insofar as we</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.670" end="00:52:49.930" style="s2">define success it&#39;s embedded within</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.620" end="00:52:52.300" style="s2">these mythological ideas which are ideas</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.930" end="00:52:54.910" style="s2">that we act out essentially not ideas</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.300" end="00:52:58.300" style="s2">that we hold or or believe or state</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.910" end="00:53:00.460" style="s2">they&#39;re ideas that we act out and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.300" end="00:53:02.440" style="s2">idea of the divine individual is at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.460" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">center of our law which is why for</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.440" end="00:53:07.360" style="s2">example even if you&#39;re accused of murder</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:11.080" style="s2">even if there&#39;s overwhelming evidence</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.360" end="00:53:13.590" style="s2">against you you still have value that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.080" end="00:53:16.030" style="s2">the state cannot merely trample on and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.590" end="00:53:17.470" style="s2">that&#39;s well first of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.030" end="00:53:21.190" style="s2">unbelievable that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.470" end="00:53:23.110" style="s2">because you know the typical barbaric</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.190" end="00:53:25.630" style="s2">society let&#39;s say which is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.110" end="00:53:27.310" style="s2">trying to reproduce very rapidly is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.630" end="00:53:28.780" style="s2">one that assumes that if you&#39;re accused</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.310" end="00:53:30.790" style="s2">of something we might as well just shoot</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.780" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">you on the off chance that you&#39;re guilty</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.790" end="00:53:36.900" style="s2">that&#39;s way easier to adopt that as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:40.300" style="s2">principle and it and it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.900" end="00:53:43.510" style="s2">satiates the the bloodlust of the mob</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.300" end="00:53:45.670" style="s2">much more effectively the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.510" end="00:53:49.260" style="s2">could have constructed a worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.670" end="00:53:51.730" style="s2">put the pathetic weak malevolent</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.260" end="00:53:54.070" style="s2">insufficient vulnerable individual at</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.730" end="00:53:56.320" style="s2">the center of the value structure is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.070" end="00:53:59.340" style="s2">just it&#39;s an accomplishment whose</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.320" end="00:54:03.340" style="s2">grandeur cannot possibly be overstated</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.340" end="00:54:06.550" style="s2">and we we are the beneficiaries of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.340" end="00:54:08.890" style="s2">system we live within its protective</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.550" end="00:54:11.830" style="s2">confines and we&#39;re doing everything we</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.890" end="00:54:16.020" style="s2">possibly can to destroy it as rapidly as</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.830" end="00:54:19.810" style="s2">possible so so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.020" end="00:54:21.780" style="s2">Joseph Campbell which it was one of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.810" end="00:54:24.750" style="s2">idols</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.780" end="00:54:28.350" style="s2">I read the hero with a thousand faces</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.750" end="00:54:31.420" style="s2">listen to his power of myth lectures</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.350" end="00:54:34.180" style="s2">because I I mean as a young man I loved</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.420" end="00:54:36.100" style="s2">Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.180" end="00:54:38.110" style="s2">you sort of you read his work and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.100" end="00:54:41.560" style="s2">find out that okay so you&#39;re Lucas he</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.110" end="00:54:45.250" style="s2">based his storyline on so he changed his</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.560" end="00:54:46.710" style="s2">story like fit more into the hero the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.250" end="00:54:51.160" style="s2">the monomyth</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.710" end="00:54:54.270" style="s2">the hero&#39;s journey story and he said</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.160" end="00:55:00.510" style="s2">that you need you need sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.270" end="00:55:03.180" style="s2">living myth or pathology to be to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.510" end="00:55:05.640" style="s2">psychological health and have spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.180" end="00:55:08.250" style="s2">health you need to live within a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.640" end="00:55:10.410" style="s2">a living mythology yes and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.250" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">yeah well the mythology tells you who</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.410" end="00:55:15.750" style="s2">you really are yeah like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.720" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">you really are a divine son of God</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.750" end="00:55:21.300" style="s2">I mean people people people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:22.680" style="s2">you actually know that because you feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.300" end="00:55:23.430" style="s2">guilty about not living up to your</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.680" end="00:55:25.710" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.430" end="00:55:28.440" style="s2">why in the world would you possibly feel</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.440" end="00:55:31.860" style="s2">have any sense at all unless they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.850" end="00:55:34.920" style="s2">narcissistic or psychopathic everyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.860" end="00:55:36.930" style="s2">feels that burden of the perfection to</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.930" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">they have not yet aspired nor attained</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.850" end="00:55:44.340" style="s2">and so and that&#39;s a testament to the to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:45.990" style="s2">the overwhelming potential that</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.340" end="00:55:47.730" style="s2">characterizes each individual and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.990" end="00:55:49.560" style="s2">really what I&#39;m trying to point out in</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.730" end="00:55:51.840" style="s2">the biblical lectures there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.560" end="00:55:54.840" style="s2">continual stories about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.840" end="00:55:56.280" style="s2">humanity and the nature of proper being</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.840" end="00:55:59.840" style="s2">in the face of the tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.280" end="00:56:03.110" style="s2">malevolence of life and the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.840" end="00:56:07.190" style="s2">Western the Western world&#39;s attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.110" end="00:56:10.920" style="s2">to to formulate that as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.190" end="00:56:14.100" style="s2">comprehensible set of stories and also a</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.920" end="00:56:17.000" style="s2">set of principles for behaviors it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.100" end="00:56:20.280" style="s2">collective struggle of our of our</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.000" end="00:56:22.020" style="s2">imagination stretched across tens of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.280" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">thousands of years maybe hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.020" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">thousands of years maybe even more than</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:27.060" style="s2">that you know because some of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:29.490" style="s2">stories the snoring the story of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.060" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">confronting the malevolent serpent like</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.490" end="00:56:34.890" style="s2">I believe that in one form or another</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:36.420" style="s2">that story is if you also consider it as</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.890" end="00:56:40.010" style="s2">something that could be acted out that</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.420" end="00:56:44.550" style="s2">stories at least 60 million years old</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.010" end="00:56:46.740" style="s2">so because Lynn is Valdis anthropologist</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.550" end="00:56:49.710" style="s2">at UCLA has demonstrated quite nicely</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.740" end="00:56:52.740" style="s2">that our tree dwelling relatives</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.710" end="00:56:54.330" style="s2">co-evolved with snakes and our continual</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.740" end="00:56:56.370" style="s2">battle with snakes and predatory</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.330" end="00:57:02.220" style="s2">reptiles was part of what gave us our</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.370" end="00:57:06.840" style="s2">acute vision oh I made these yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.220" end="00:57:08.100" style="s2">know I know I know that I have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.840" end="00:57:10.350" style="s2">this because this is one</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.100" end="00:57:12.890" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing you answer this question is</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.350" end="00:57:15.630" style="s2">that do you believe in God and I saw a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.890" end="00:57:17.130" style="s2">YouTube video with you when you said</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.630" end="00:57:19.230" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t like the question</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.130" end="00:57:22.110" style="s2">because you were you&#39;re being boxed in</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.230" end="00:57:23.700" style="s2">and I sort of I felt that because one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.110" end="00:57:26.670" style="s2">the things me and my wife have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.700" end="00:57:29.430" style="s2">wrestling with is we&#39;ve talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.670" end="00:57:31.560" style="s2">about this I said what do we mean when</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.430" end="00:57:34.830" style="s2">we say that we believe in God because in</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.560" end="00:57:37.140" style="s2">in Sweden it to be Swedish to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.830" end="00:57:38.820" style="s2">Christian it was sort of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.140" end="00:57:40.500" style="s2">today to say that you&#39;re Swedish so if</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.820" end="00:57:42.750" style="s2">you say to do a Christian you were sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.500" end="00:57:45.660" style="s2">of a good family father you had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.750" end="00:57:47.820" style="s2">values within that so you would be like</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.660" end="00:57:49.860" style="s2">a good Christian man is sort of today</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.820" end="00:57:52.440" style="s2">when you say you&#39;re a good Swedish man</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.860" end="00:57:56.430" style="s2">perhaps so it used to mean a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.440" end="00:57:59.790" style="s2">but then you had the evangelical</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.430" end="00:58:01.260" style="s2">Christians criticizing exactly this and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.790" end="00:58:02.850" style="s2">saying that you are lost contact with</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.260" end="00:58:06.990" style="s2">God and then they meant it in a much</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.850" end="00:58:09.120" style="s2">smaller sense and so I they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.990" end="00:58:12.120" style="s2">confuse the biblical stories with lit</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.120" end="00:58:13.650" style="s2">with empirical history yeah and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.120" end="00:58:15.720" style="s2">surprising they do that because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.650" end="00:58:17.940" style="s2">trying to defend their faith against</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.720" end="00:58:19.470" style="s2">let&#39;s call it the postmodern assault or</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.940" end="00:58:21.360" style="s2">even the modernist assault for that</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.470" end="00:58:24.060" style="s2">matter I have some sympathy with their</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.360" end="00:58:27.210" style="s2">motivations but the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.060" end="00:58:29.640" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand that not all truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.210" end="00:58:31.230" style="s2">is empirical truth in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.640" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">fundamental truths as far as I could</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.230" end="00:58:36.150" style="s2">tell paradoxically enough are Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:37.740" style="s2">and they actually line up with religious</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.150" end="00:58:40.350" style="s2">truths which is the point I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.740" end="00:58:42.270" style="s2">trying to make when I discuss such</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.350" end="00:58:48.420" style="s2">issues with people like Sam Harris like</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.270" end="00:58:50.190" style="s2">Sam is a very very smart guy but he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.420" end="00:58:51.660" style="s2">worships the intellect that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.190" end="00:58:54.210" style="s2">thing I would say and the second thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.660" end="00:58:57.150" style="s2">is that I was never able to push him to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.210" end="00:58:59.310" style="s2">his solution he&#39;d never let me go there</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.150" end="00:59:01.980" style="s2">because you know his idea is that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.310" end="00:59:04.290" style="s2">could rationally order society so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.980" end="00:59:08.340" style="s2">the well-being of people was maximized</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.290" end="00:59:11.100" style="s2">and you know he even said - I think it</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.340" end="00:59:13.830" style="s2">was I can&#39;t remember which interview it</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.100" end="00:59:16.110" style="s2">was but he said explicitly to the person</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.830" end="00:59:17.790" style="s2">that he was interviewing that he could</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.110" end="00:59:19.170" style="s2">sit down right now and come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.790" end="00:59:21.120" style="s2">religious system that was much more</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.170" end="00:59:21.809" style="s2">rational and appropriate than any of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.120" end="00:59:23.969" style="s2">ones that have</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.809" end="00:59:25.529" style="s2">that have existed to date and I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.969" end="00:59:28.259" style="s2">well you know you&#39;re falling right into</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.529" end="00:59:30.779" style="s2">that rationalist utopian pitfall there</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.259" end="00:59:33.059" style="s2">your nurse not that smart no one can do</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.779" end="00:59:35.009" style="s2">that and as soon as you do it you end up</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.059" end="00:59:38.609" style="s2">where the Socialists like the radical</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.009" end="00:59:41.099" style="s2">Soviet socialists or the Nazi utopians</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.609" end="00:59:44.729" style="s2">ended up we will be speaking Esperanto</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.099" end="00:59:45.509" style="s2">by now though yeah well like yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.729" end="00:59:48.959" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.509" end="00:59:52.259" style="s2">rational language them then Swedish much</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.959" end="00:59:54.989" style="s2">more most languages are yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.259" end="00:59:56.819" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.989" end="00:59:58.949" style="s2">things I really liked about Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.819" end="01:00:01.410" style="s2">is that this was a notes from</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.949" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">underground he he just states it very</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.410" end="01:00:04.949" style="s2">clearly he said you know the one thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:06.449" style="s2">that you cannot claim about the history</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.949" end="01:00:09.479" style="s2">of the world and he means the history of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.449" end="01:00:12.660" style="s2">being is that it&#39;s rational and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.479" end="01:00:14.279" style="s2">that he&#39;s criticizing the idea that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.660" end="01:00:17.009" style="s2">could use scientists scientific</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.279" end="01:00:19.079" style="s2">investigation and rationality to lay out</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.009" end="01:00:21.239" style="s2">a clear representation of objective</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.079" end="01:00:22.920" style="s2">reality what he&#39;s saying is that if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.239" end="01:00:25.140" style="s2">take the terrible suffering and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.920" end="01:00:27.929" style="s2">malevolence into account as fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.140" end="01:00:30.539" style="s2">realities that a rationalist perspective</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.929" end="01:00:33.089" style="s2">is absolutely insufficient to tell the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.539" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">story and that&#39;s there&#39;s no doubt about</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.089" end="01:00:36.150" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:38.939" style="s2">it&#39;s just rationality just breaks down</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.150" end="01:00:42.150" style="s2">in the face of those things it hits an</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.939" end="01:00:44.609" style="s2">obstacle that it cannot contend with so</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.150" end="01:00:46.410" style="s2">you need something else and you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.609" end="01:00:49.140" style="s2">there&#39;s this great image of Christ as</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.410" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">Pantocrator very very old image I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.140" end="01:00:53.249" style="s2">fortunately can&#39;t remember which</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:55.019" style="s2">Cathedral it&#39;s represented in but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.249" end="01:00:58.259" style="s2">great image and I&#39;m having one of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.019" end="01:01:00.869" style="s2">carved for me right now it&#39;s so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.259" end="01:01:03.029" style="s2">medieval image of Christ and his face is</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.869" end="01:01:06.509" style="s2">divided into two halves so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.029" end="01:01:07.890" style="s2">asymmetrical and 1/2 the eyes are</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.509" end="01:01:09.029" style="s2">different and the facial expression is</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.890" end="01:01:11.880" style="s2">different than the other and he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.029" end="01:01:14.699" style="s2">he&#39;s on portrayed on the top of the dome</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.880" end="01:01:16.679" style="s2">and holding a book so the book is sacred</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.699" end="01:01:18.900" style="s2">right so that&#39;s a great idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.679" end="01:01:21.329" style="s2">book is sacred that&#39;s a great idea man</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.900" end="01:01:24.150" style="s2">and the idea that the word is sacred but</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.329" end="01:01:26.369" style="s2">then the picture also represents human</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.150" end="01:01:29.670" style="s2">beings as creatures with one foot in</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.369" end="01:01:31.799" style="s2">thee in them in the profane and one foot</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.670" end="01:01:33.420" style="s2">in the sacred or one foot in the finite</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.799" end="01:01:35.160" style="s2">and one foot in the infinite and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.420" end="01:01:38.430" style="s2">actually think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.160" end="01:01:39.990" style="s2">that&#39;s empirically true like we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.430" end="01:01:42.210" style="s2">these weird creatures that are both</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.990" end="01:01:44.370" style="s2">finite and infinite at the same time and</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.210" end="01:01:46.950" style="s2">we have experiences of that even like</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.370" end="01:01:48.390" style="s2">deep religious experiences psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.950" end="01:01:53.010" style="s2">experiences for that matter</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.390" end="01:01:54.840" style="s2">um invoke that feeling of that invoke</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.010" end="01:01:57.780" style="s2">the reality I would say of our</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.840" end="01:02:00.270" style="s2">connection with the infinite now what</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.780" end="01:02:02.370" style="s2">that infinite is so let&#39;s call that God</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.270" end="01:02:04.020" style="s2">I mean the Christian idea is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.370" end="01:02:06.480" style="s2">actually outside of time and space</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.020" end="01:02:10.680" style="s2">itself which is quite a grand notion and</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.480" end="01:02:12.840" style="s2">not the least bit unsophisticated by the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.680" end="01:02:14.940" style="s2">way it&#39;s a tremendously sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.840" end="01:02:16.590" style="s2">idea that something actually exists</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.940" end="01:02:19.710" style="s2">outside the fabric of time and space</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.590" end="01:02:21.240" style="s2">that transcends it that that&#39;s there at</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.710" end="01:02:23.790" style="s2">the beginning and at the end that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.240" end="01:02:25.440" style="s2">unbelievably sophisticated idea and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.790" end="01:02:27.900" style="s2">think that people can experience that</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.440" end="01:02:30.150" style="s2">and do quite commonly which was why the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.900" end="01:02:34.110" style="s2">psychedelic revolution in the 60s was so</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.150" end="01:02:36.000" style="s2">absolutely potent so these sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.110" end="01:02:38.550" style="s2">things can&#39;t just be dismissed with some</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.000" end="01:02:40.290" style="s2">rationalist sleight of hand and and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.550" end="01:02:42.390" style="s2">some discussion of the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.290" end="01:02:44.630" style="s2">Christianity judeo-christianity let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.390" end="01:02:47.010" style="s2">say is some like primitive set of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.630" end="01:02:49.800" style="s2">wish-fulfillment superstitions or some</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.010" end="01:02:52.020" style="s2">power game it&#39;s like you just have no</p>

<p begin="01:02:52.020" end="01:02:58.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what your criticisms are and also</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.230" end="01:03:00.420" style="s2">I I would say when will you you&#39;re asked</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.440" end="01:03:04.650" style="s2">when you ask someone do you believe in</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.420" end="01:03:07.290" style="s2">God you I ask myself if I say that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.650" end="01:03:10.320" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in God if I if what what</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.290" end="01:03:12.270" style="s2">in within me when I say what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.320" end="01:03:14.190" style="s2">different within me when I say that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.270" end="01:03:16.020" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in God compared to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.190" end="01:03:19.070" style="s2">person that says that he does believe in</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.020" end="01:03:20.460" style="s2">God I mean is if I feel sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.070" end="01:03:23.670" style="s2">irrational</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.460" end="01:03:25.500" style="s2">I wake up or I take a glass of wine and</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.670" end="01:03:27.990" style="s2">then suddenly I&#39;m I&#39;m overwhelmed with</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.500" end="01:03:31.110" style="s2">love for humankind for my fellow man or</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.990" end="01:03:32.790" style="s2">something like that so if I if I was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.110" end="01:03:36.030" style="s2">person who will say that I believe in</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.790" end="01:03:38.490" style="s2">God would that be something is it</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.030" end="01:03:42.030" style="s2">something qualitatively different with</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.490" end="01:03:44.220" style="s2">it between a person between me compared</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.030" end="01:03:45.750" style="s2">to that person do you understand what</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.220" end="01:03:49.110" style="s2">I&#39;m saying no like I haven&#39;t quite got</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.750" end="01:03:51.090" style="s2">that yet like what is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.110" end="01:03:53.730" style="s2">perience of believing in God and how is</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.090" end="01:03:56.310" style="s2">that quality qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.730" end="01:03:57.990" style="s2">from a person who says that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.310" end="01:03:59.640" style="s2">believe oh yes I see what you mean well</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.990" end="01:04:02.190" style="s2">that is that is part of the question the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.640" end="01:04:04.950" style="s2">question is here well the when someone</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.190" end="01:04:07.170" style="s2">says do you believe in God no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.950" end="01:04:10.320" style="s2">three parts to that question the first</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.170" end="01:04:12.870" style="s2">question is who is the you to which they</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.320" end="01:04:15.960" style="s2">are referring and that turns out to not</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.870" end="01:04:17.790" style="s2">be a simple question I mean Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.960" end="01:04:19.890" style="s2">did a very good job of taking apart the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.790" end="01:04:22.050" style="s2">idea of the I you know because he was</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.890" end="01:04:25.890" style="s2">realist critiquing Descartes I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.050" end="01:04:27.750" style="s2">therefore I am and and so the idea the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.890" end="01:04:29.490" style="s2">first question is well who is the you to</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.750" end="01:04:31.410" style="s2">which you are referring the second is</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.490" end="01:04:33.990" style="s2">what do you mean by belief the third is</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.410" end="01:04:35.940" style="s2">what do you mean by God it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.990" end="01:04:38.310" style="s2">can&#39;t just leap to the assumption that</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.940" end="01:04:39.930" style="s2">the person asking the question and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.310" end="01:04:42.660" style="s2">person answering the question have the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.930" end="01:04:45.360" style="s2">same views on those and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.660" end="01:04:47.010" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the reason why I</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.360" end="01:04:49.140" style="s2">don&#39;t like the question you know like I</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.010" end="01:04:52.080" style="s2">said well I act as if I believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.140" end="01:04:53.780" style="s2">and so I would say that&#39;s the more</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.080" end="01:04:57.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the most fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.780" end="01:04:59.040" style="s2">manifestation of faith but I could also</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.030" end="01:05:02.040" style="s2">say I believe and don&#39;t believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.040" end="01:05:03.900" style="s2">and you think well you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.040" end="01:05:07.110" style="s2">think both of those things at the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.900" end="01:05:11.460" style="s2">time it&#39;s like well yeah that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.110" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.460" end="01:05:16.950" style="s2">asking something that complicated then</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s absolutely no reason to assume</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.950" end="01:05:22.080" style="s2">that you can&#39;t have paradoxical</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.960" end="01:05:23.880" style="s2">responses to it so you could you could</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.080" end="01:05:25.590" style="s2">even say maybe that the injunction in</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.880" end="01:05:27.530" style="s2">the Old Testament is something like you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.590" end="01:05:30.150" style="s2">should believe and not believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.530" end="01:05:33.710" style="s2">because it&#39;s very complicated it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.150" end="01:05:37.380" style="s2">not it&#39;s not by any means a simple</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.710" end="01:05:39.960" style="s2">question I know I don&#39;t remember his</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.380" end="01:05:42.450" style="s2">name though but I think perhaps it was a</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.960" end="01:05:45.300" style="s2">Burkert or something like that like he</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.450" end="01:05:47.880" style="s2">said that myth is about reconciling</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.300" end="01:05:50.010" style="s2">contradictions within the human</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.880" end="01:05:52.050" style="s2">condition yeah exactly that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.010" end="01:05:55.520" style="s2">well that&#39;s what a successful myth does</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.050" end="01:05:58.140" style="s2">and part of the reason that these</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:06:00.210" style="s2">ideologies that we&#39;d be discussing like</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.140" end="01:06:02.730" style="s2">feminism have so much power is because</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.210" end="01:06:04.560" style="s2">they actually draw their motive for</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.730" end="01:06:06.330" style="s2">from an underlying religious substrate</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.560" end="01:06:08.310" style="s2">but they only tell half the story</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.330" end="01:06:10.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what an idio Lachie is so when</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.310" end="01:06:12.450" style="s2">the feminists say culture is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.680" end="01:06:13.369" style="s2">tyrannical patriarchy it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.450" end="01:06:17.190" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.369" end="01:06:21.060" style="s2">but it&#39;s also the benevolent wise king</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.190" end="01:06:22.859" style="s2">so like while then they say why can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.060" end="01:06:23.790" style="s2">one and the other at the same time and</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.859" end="01:06:26.090" style="s2">the answer is well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.790" end="01:06:28.080" style="s2">multi-dimensional phenomena that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.090" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">encapsulating within a single category</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.080" end="01:06:33.530" style="s2">it can contain contradictions in fact it</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:37.800" style="s2">does because society obviously</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.530" end="01:06:39.530" style="s2">constrains and and and kills you even</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.800" end="01:06:41.609" style="s2">like you die in to your neural</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.530" end="01:06:44.490" style="s2">configuration is that when you&#39;re first</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.609" end="01:06:47.190" style="s2">born you have more neural connections</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.490" end="01:06:50.970" style="s2">than you will ever in your life and most</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.190" end="01:06:53.520" style="s2">of them die and so so you die into your</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.970" end="01:06:56.430" style="s2">four-year-old self and then between the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.520" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">ages of 16 and 20 you die into your</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.430" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">adult self and so the idea that that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:04.380" style="s2">society that you&#39;re in is a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:07.140" style="s2">tyrant that shapes you by death is</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.380" end="01:07:09.510" style="s2">exactly true but by the same token it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.140" end="01:07:11.340" style="s2">also err almost everything that enables</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.510" end="01:07:14.970" style="s2">you and enables you to function in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.340" end="01:07:16.950" style="s2">world and so the critic critics of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.970" end="01:07:20.340" style="s2">patriarchy say tyranny tyranny tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.950" end="01:07:24.270" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah yeah tyranny but not only</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.340" end="01:07:26.730" style="s2">tyranny and they say evil man evil man</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.270" end="01:07:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah obviously but not only</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.730" end="01:07:33.270" style="s2">evil man not only that and that&#39;s why a</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.800" end="01:07:35.609" style="s2">genuine mythology would and I would put</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.270" end="01:07:38.580" style="s2">Freudian psychoanalysis in that category</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.609" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">because Freud had a very balanced view</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.580" end="01:07:44.850" style="s2">of the nature of being talks about both</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:47.180" style="s2">parts of the paradox at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.850" end="01:07:50.040" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the dragon and the gold</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.180" end="01:07:51.540" style="s2">it&#39;s the terrible devouring mother and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.040" end="01:07:53.910" style="s2">the and the Virgin Mary</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.540" end="01:07:56.820" style="s2">it&#39;s the tyrant and the wise King its</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.910" end="01:07:59.730" style="s2">Christ and Satan it&#39;s all of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.820" end="01:08:01.619" style="s2">paradoxes stacked on top of one another</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.730" end="01:08:03.570" style="s2">and then the story about how you go</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.619" end="01:08:07.500" style="s2">about dealing with that that&#39;s a true</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.570" end="01:08:09.450" style="s2">religious myth yeah and it ideologies</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.500" end="01:08:14.250" style="s2">just takes a part of that says this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.450" end="01:08:16.140" style="s2">the whole I mean in early Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.250" end="01:08:16.880" style="s2">there was a large battle between many</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.140" end="01:08:23.270" style="s2">kists</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:25.549" style="s2">and gnostics and what could turn out to</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.270" end="01:08:27.589" style="s2">be the Catholic Church and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.549" end="01:08:30.290" style="s2">mainstream Church and and they said that</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.589" end="01:08:32.659" style="s2">the evil evil was like that the world we</p>

<p begin="01:09:25.310" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">think that what evil is is the absence</p>

<p begin="01:10:08.120" end="01:10:13.719" style="s2">think we experience that as human beings</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.830" end="01:10:17.000" style="s2">and that our ethical obligation is to</p>

<p begin="01:10:35.600" end="01:10:40.310" style="s2">thing that I&#39;ve been trying to tell well</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.180" end="01:10:42.560" style="s2">those who will listen let&#39;s say but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.310" end="01:10:44.390" style="s2">so far it&#39;s mostly being young men who</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:47.120" style="s2">are dying for this message like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.390" end="01:10:50.120" style="s2">they&#39;re dying for it you know but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.120" end="01:10:53.570" style="s2">really God he&#39;s I go to these talks now</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.120" end="01:10:56.210" style="s2">you know public talks and where I speak</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.570" end="01:11:00.040" style="s2">about responsibility and truth and like</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.210" end="01:11:00.040" style="s2">after the talks there are like</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.350" end="01:11:05.810" style="s2">crowds of mostly young men who line up</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.500" end="01:11:07.930" style="s2">and say you know I was nihilistic I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.810" end="01:11:11.000" style="s2">desperate I was suicidal I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.930" end="01:11:13.760" style="s2">malevolent and resentful and like going</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.000" end="01:11:16.010" style="s2">bad places and I&#39;ve started listening to</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.760" end="01:11:18.350" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been saying about myth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.010" end="01:11:21.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like brought me out of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.350" end="01:11:23.030" style="s2">horrible hole and that&#39;s just one person</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.230" end="01:11:26.060" style="s2">after another says the same thing you</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.030" end="01:11:28.430" style="s2">know it&#39;s so and I&#39;ve had thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.060" end="01:11:30.950" style="s2">letters like that and maybe tens of</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.430" end="01:11:34.610" style="s2">thousands now I can&#39;t even begin to keep</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.950" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">up with them and well thank God for that</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.610" end="01:11:39.800" style="s2">you know how do you feel I mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:44.440" style="s2">personally when so many are turning to</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.800" end="01:11:47.270" style="s2">you for for this counselor from guidance</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.440" end="01:11:49.190" style="s2">well you don&#39;t I read this paper a long</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.270" end="01:11:51.050" style="s2">time ago called relations between the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.190" end="01:11:55.100" style="s2">ego and the unconscious which is one of</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.050" end="01:11:57.530" style="s2">use maybe it&#39;s his most stellar work and</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.100" end="01:11:59.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s not a paper you can understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.530" end="01:12:01.400" style="s2">unless you know what it&#39;s about and</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.060" end="01:12:05.120" style="s2">because he talked about the danger of</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.400" end="01:12:07.330" style="s2">ego inflation that&#39;s so so imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.120" end="01:12:12.140" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with archetypal ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.330" end="01:12:15.230" style="s2">that you can fall prey to the temptation</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.140" end="01:12:16.790" style="s2">to assume because you started to</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.230" end="01:12:18.440" style="s2">understand the ideas and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.790" end="01:12:22.250" style="s2">communicate about them that they are</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.440" end="01:12:24.530" style="s2">somehow yours and then what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.250" end="01:12:26.810" style="s2">that can produce a messianic inflation</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.530" end="01:12:31.580" style="s2">and so that would characterize someone</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.810" end="01:12:33.650" style="s2">like Hitler for example and that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.580" end="01:12:37.150" style="s2">tantamount to a form of mental illness</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.650" end="01:12:42.050" style="s2">because what happens is that you take on</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.150" end="01:12:44.630" style="s2">the grandeur of the mythological ideas</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.050" end="01:12:46.700" style="s2">and the archetypal ideas and the power</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.630" end="01:12:51.100" style="s2">of those ideas as if they were your own</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.700" end="01:12:55.100" style="s2">creations well that&#39;s a very bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.100" end="01:12:59.270" style="s2">and so I read I read those that paper</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.100" end="01:13:02.810" style="s2">after I had a dream where I was blown by</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.270" end="01:13:04.670" style="s2">a wind into the top of a cathedral I was</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.810" end="01:13:08.450" style="s2">in this chandelier in this huge</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.670" end="01:13:10.130" style="s2">Cathedral mm-hmm like say 20 times</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.450" end="01:13:12.980" style="s2">bigger than st. Peter&#39;s you could hardly</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.130" end="01:13:13.800" style="s2">even see the walls and I was put up in</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.980" end="01:13:16.050" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.800" end="01:13:19.860" style="s2">at the center of this Cathedral right</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.050" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">way above the ground and then I got down</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.860" end="01:13:24.810" style="s2">some Howard because I didn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:26.850" style="s2">there and then the wind dissolved me and</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.810" end="01:13:28.890" style="s2">blew me back there and I woke up and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.850" end="01:13:32.640" style="s2">thought oh my god that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.890" end="01:13:34.440" style="s2">crazy dream like a dream put me at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.640" end="01:13:36.000" style="s2">center of the cross at the center of</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.440" end="01:13:38.130" style="s2">being and I thought what the hell that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.000" end="01:13:41.670" style="s2">what am I supposed to make of a dream</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.130" end="01:13:44.340" style="s2">like that it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s delusional</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.670" end="01:13:45.990" style="s2">let&#39;s say order zone delusional and it</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.340" end="01:13:48.660" style="s2">was a very powerful dream like I can</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.990" end="01:13:50.010" style="s2">still I can still see it and I read the</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.660" end="01:13:51.750" style="s2">relations between the ego and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.010" end="01:13:53.250" style="s2">unconscious at that time and started to</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.750" end="01:13:55.470" style="s2">understand what was happening is that I</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.250" end="01:13:58.050" style="s2">was starting to understand what these</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.470" end="01:13:59.880" style="s2">archetypal ideas meant that the place of</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.050" end="01:14:03.510" style="s2">the individual is actually at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.880" end="01:14:05.430" style="s2">crucifix at the center of reality the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.510" end="01:14:08.130" style="s2">point of maximal suffering and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.430" end="01:14:11.850" style="s2">acceptance of that that&#39;s all true but</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.130" end="01:14:16.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not true of me hmm right</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.850" end="01:14:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s everybody is a center of the cosmos</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.280" end="01:14:22.290" style="s2">and and and so you have to detach</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.190" end="01:14:24.240" style="s2">yourself as carefully as you can from</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.290" end="01:14:26.970" style="s2">the archetypal ideas themselves because</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.240" end="01:14:28.860" style="s2">otherwise you end up identifying with</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.970" end="01:14:33.960" style="s2">them personally or people identify you</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.860" end="01:14:37.590" style="s2">with them and that that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.960" end="01:14:41.970" style="s2">ultimate what would you call it the</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.590" end="01:14:44.760" style="s2">ultimate temptation of pride and so no</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.970" end="01:14:47.480" style="s2">that&#39;s so I&#39;m I try to be very careful</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.760" end="01:14:54.180" style="s2">of that very cognizant of that and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.480" end="01:14:56.910" style="s2">to keep a good eye on my yeah it&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.180" end="01:14:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like this you know when the</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.910" end="01:15:02.010" style="s2">Emperor&#39;s in the Roman Empire when they</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.520" end="01:15:05.010" style="s2">rode into trials they had a slave behind</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.010" end="01:15:09.840" style="s2">them telling them a mental morning right</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.010" end="01:15:12.570" style="s2">exactly exactly this job yes it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.840" end="01:15:16.710" style="s2">I really like that idea and I like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.570" end="01:15:19.820" style="s2">idea of reminding yourself about death</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.710" end="01:15:24.429" style="s2">to keep humble to keep yourself humble</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.820" end="01:15:25.959" style="s2">it sounds a little well death in sin</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.429" end="01:15:27.550" style="s2">you know because the other thing that</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.959" end="01:15:29.349" style="s2">you have to and maybe this is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.550" end="01:15:31.209" style="s2">advantage that the Catholics have over</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.349" end="01:15:33.610" style="s2">the Protestants is that the Catholics at</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.209" end="01:15:36.639" style="s2">least put their sins in front of them</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.610" end="01:15:38.519" style="s2">constantly which is very analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.639" end="01:15:41.469" style="s2">what you just described because it and</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.519" end="01:15:45.849" style="s2">you know I try to be very very careful</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.469" end="01:15:47.769" style="s2">about paying attention to all the things</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.849" end="01:15:50.289" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing wrong and I have people</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.769" end="01:15:53.729" style="s2">my family and friends who are helping me</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.289" end="01:15:56.709" style="s2">do that and and because it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.729" end="01:15:59.979" style="s2">to call it a strange situation to be and</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.709" end="01:16:05.199" style="s2">is just barely scraping the surface yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.979" end="01:16:07.749" style="s2">I would like to ask you one at least one</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.199" end="01:16:10.510" style="s2">more I mean I could ask you talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.749" end="01:16:12.909" style="s2">for four hours but I know you you have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.510" end="01:16:14.949" style="s2">busy man yeah I should let&#39;s do one more</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.909" end="01:16:18.039" style="s2">question we can always talk again you</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.949" end="01:16:23.469" style="s2">know so yeah but the church will Sweden</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.039" end="01:16:25.809" style="s2">is our old state Church it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.469" end="01:16:28.300" style="s2">contemplating replacing the gendered</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.809" end="01:16:30.789" style="s2">nouns of their guide for church services</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.300" end="01:16:33.130" style="s2">and they&#39;ve already starting to replace</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.789" end="01:16:35.380" style="s2">the Lord and he and him with God in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.130" end="01:16:36.880" style="s2">lot of places yeah me language more</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.380" end="01:16:42.369" style="s2">inclusive yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.880" end="01:16:43.840" style="s2">and yeah well the people who well the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.369" end="01:16:46.030" style="s2">people who are running the church have</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.840" end="01:16:48.699" style="s2">absolutely no idea about what any of its</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.030" end="01:16:48.939" style="s2">doctrines mean yeah it&#39;s as simple as</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.699" end="01:16:51.130" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.939" end="01:16:53.320" style="s2">like I mean there is existence in</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.130" end="01:16:55.689" style="s2">Christianity on the androgyny of Christ</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.320" end="01:16:57.969" style="s2">and there are elements of God that have</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.689" end="01:17:01.300" style="s2">been portrayed as feminine like Sophia</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.969" end="01:17:04.150" style="s2">which is wisdom but you don&#39;t mess with</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.300" end="01:17:07.059" style="s2">those things you don&#39;t rewrite them like</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.150" end="01:17:08.530" style="s2">that not not without having your soul</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.059" end="01:17:11.709" style="s2">tremble and quake at your</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.530" end="01:17:13.959" style="s2">presumptuousness yeah and the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.709" end="01:17:16.539" style="s2">you can just casually rewrite these</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.959" end="01:17:18.579" style="s2">ancient texts it&#39;s like these people who</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.539" end="01:17:21.340" style="s2">rewrite fairytales so that they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.579" end="01:17:23.849" style="s2">in keeping with modern sensibility it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.340" end="01:17:26.380" style="s2">like they&#39;re so unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.849" end="01:17:29.079" style="s2">intellectually narcissistic that well</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.380" end="01:17:31.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s positively satanic in its in</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.079" end="01:17:33.999" style="s2">its overreach and I mean that in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.420" end="01:17:38.230" style="s2">most technical sense it&#39;s this it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.999" end="01:17:41.200" style="s2">satanic temptation of the untrammeled</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.230" end="01:17:43.590" style="s2">unbound intellect it&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.200" end="01:17:46.750" style="s2">milton warned against in Paradise Lost</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.590" end="01:17:48.610" style="s2">so it&#39;s a complete catastrophe all it</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.750" end="01:17:51.310" style="s2">will do is speed the demolition of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.610" end="01:17:53.620" style="s2">church so and I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.310" end="01:17:55.060" style="s2">aimed at actually because of course the</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.620" end="01:17:57.520" style="s2">church is just too patriarchal construct</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.060" end="01:17:59.470" style="s2">anyways and it&#39;s oppressive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.520" end="01:18:01.330" style="s2">oppressed women forever despite his</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.470" end="01:18:05.040" style="s2">assistant insistence that men and women</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.330" end="01:18:10.180" style="s2">were both made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.040" end="01:18:13.360" style="s2">Canada I think that&#39;s our church is</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.180" end="01:18:15.460" style="s2">pretty much doomed we&#39;ll close to these</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.360" end="01:18:17.860" style="s2">issues it&#39;s very it&#39;s more political</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.460" end="01:18:19.870" style="s2">than a lot of politicians yes well</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.860" end="01:18:24.220" style="s2">that&#39;s it it&#39;s it&#39;s that when the church</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.870" end="01:18:27.010" style="s2">becomes political it&#39;s done yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.220" end="01:18:29.020" style="s2">mean I as I said I have I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.010" end="01:18:32.710" style="s2">gotten the most out of this interview it</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.020" end="01:18:34.840" style="s2">was really really informative and really</p>
