    "description": "\"We are trying to promote health...promoting how the body self-regulates.\" -Founder Daniel Schmachtenberger at Neurohacker Collective.\n\nLearn more at https://neurohacker.com\nOur approach at Neurohacker is premised on the idea that the body has an innate intelligence that can be supported and enhanced. No overriding the body’s natural functioning or tinkering with parts in isolation. We work to support the health of the body’s systems as an integrated whole, helping to increase its capacity and resilience.\n\nAll of our products are designed to help the body more effectively regulate its own biochemistry and restore homeostatic balance. Our goal is to support the integrity of those internal processes in becoming more robust and fully-functioning over time, producing lasting benefit even after discontinued use.",
