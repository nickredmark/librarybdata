<p begin="00:00:04.549" end="00:00:09.510" style="s2">but the question is okay we&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.230" end="00:00:12.420" style="s2">our minds but can we say anything more</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.510" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">about it and the reason that that video</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.420" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">of that apparently peaceful protests are</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">being hauled off I mean hauled out of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:22.020" style="s2">crowd specifically because he&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">talking that really looks like an</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">egregious violation of his First</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">Amendment rights and it&#39;s not the only</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">video that looks like this but what</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">struck me most was that I had not seen</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:36.210" style="s2">them right I came to that video because</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:37.950" style="s2">Sam Harris said something on his Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.210" end="00:00:39.629" style="s2">feed about what is the meaning of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.950" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">videos in which apparently peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.629" end="00:00:44.070" style="s2">protesters are addressed by the police</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:45.690" style="s2">and I thought I haven&#39;t seen those</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">videos I&#39;ve seen videos in which the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.690" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">police are very aggressive but I also</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">know that the protesters are being very</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:53.340" style="s2">aggressive what&#39;s he talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">and so I went looking and I found videos</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">on Camille Foster&#39;s Twitter feed and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">looked at them and they were exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">described and I thought this is so</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:06.210" style="s2">relevant at this moment that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:08.250" style="s2">that I am NOT running into it is telling</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.210" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">us something and I think what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.250" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">telling us is that Twitter&#39;s algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">whatever it is thinks I&#39;m a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">because I say a lot of things about what</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:20.340" style="s2">isn&#39;t right over on the left and it has</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:22.590" style="s2">misunderstood me and also it thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:24.750" style="s2">if you&#39;re conservative which you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.590" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">but that if you were a conservative you</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.750" end="00:01:31.110" style="s2">would be uninterested in seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">that confound your current views right</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.110" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">or maybe even to say that it thinks is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">the mistake because what it is doing I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">would suggest is it is simply feeding</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">people that which confirms what they</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">already believe and so here&#39;s my very</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">simple contention about some large</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:50.810" style="s2">fraction of what is taking place at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.810" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">everybody is plugged into an apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">that is sitting in between us the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">conversation used to and what it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:04.350" style="s2">doing is it is feeding us things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">confirm what we actually believe much of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.350" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">which is real but that in effect people</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">smart scientific people who know very</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">well that the right way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:17.490" style="s2">carefully is to be falsification Asst to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:20.250" style="s2">look for things that disconfirm your</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.490" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">beliefs are being fed an overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.250" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">verification ax stand that is causing</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:27.180" style="s2">everybody to be dead sure they know</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">what&#39;s going on when very few of us have</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.180" end="00:02:31.800" style="s2">any clue and one thing that is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">different about this moment than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.800" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">moment of 20 years ago or 40 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:38.580" style="s2">is that we had editors and people have</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">complained about editors and the move</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.580" end="00:02:43.890" style="s2">towards social media is seen by some as</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">a populist revolution in which anyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.890" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">can have voice but if you want to watch</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:52.470" style="s2">fox news and also want to watch CNN you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">know something about the editorial</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.470" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">biases of those networks and you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.490" style="s2">choose to watch both and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">you are going to get still skewed still</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.490" end="00:03:04.770" style="s2">edited still presumably biased but</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">versions of the biases and edits of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.770" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">those perspective networks whereas on</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">Twitter if you follow a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:17.330" style="s2">people as you and I do you follow I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">follow Camille Foster and Sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.330" end="00:03:21.720" style="s2">boy there&#39;s so many other people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">once you found this I went looking what</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.720" end="00:03:25.740" style="s2">there are many people who I follow and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:27.750" style="s2">don&#39;t follow thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.740" end="00:03:29.610" style="s2">specifically so that I can see what</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.750" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">these people are saying there are many</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.610" end="00:03:34.140" style="s2">people whom you and I follow who have</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.220" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">been posting these videos and neither of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.140" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">us we&#39;re seeing them that tells us that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:40.650" style="s2">this is not the same as being able to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:42.630" style="s2">and decide I&#39;m going to read the New</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.650" end="00:03:43.530" style="s2">York Times and I&#39;m going to read The</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.630" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">Wall Street Journal</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.530" end="00:03:47.580" style="s2">I&#39;m going to watch CNN and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:50.880" style="s2">watch Fox it&#39;s not the same thing we</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.580" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">have had our choice taken away but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.880" end="00:03:54.390" style="s2">have we are being given the appearance</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:56.459" style="s2">that we have more choice than ever we</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.390" end="00:03:58.320" style="s2">have the sense that we are correcting</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.459" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">for this but you have no idea how</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.320" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">quickly you have to swim upstream to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">counteract the algorithm and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">having an absolutely the wildering</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:13.620" style="s2">effect on us I think and for me the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">iconic instance of this is Dave</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.620" end="00:04:19.590" style="s2">Chappelle&#39;s new video right so I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:23.880" style="s2">not seen it yet so it&#39;s titled 846 that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.590" end="00:04:26.070" style="s2">8 minutes and 46 seconds is what Derek</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.880" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">shawhans nee spent on</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.070" end="00:04:34.440" style="s2">on George Floyd&#39;s neck and this piece is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">not really a comedy piece and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.440" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">Chappell talks about that I must say I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">know you share my feelings about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:47.910" style="s2">but I think Chappell is he&#39;s a he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:50.100" style="s2">genius and his genius extends to many</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:54.390" style="s2">different things he&#39;s figured out a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.100" end="00:04:57.180" style="s2">to to be authentic but to look through</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.390" end="00:04:59.130" style="s2">the eyes of someone else and allow them</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.180" end="00:05:00.810" style="s2">to see the authenticity of something</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.130" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">that they are predisposed not to see so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.810" end="00:05:07.350" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s no shortage of love and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:10.260" style="s2">gratitude for what he&#39;s delivered this</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.350" end="00:05:13.470" style="s2">piece that he&#39;s put out very popular</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.260" end="00:05:16.140" style="s2">piece retweeted by Joe Rogan very</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.470" end="00:05:17.550" style="s2">enthusiastically Barry Weiss I think who</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.140" end="00:05:20.990" style="s2">is punishing us for something I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.550" end="00:05:29.150" style="s2">know what but in any case the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.990" end="00:05:32.430" style="s2">Chappelle piece is wrong and it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.150" end="00:05:34.200" style="s2">completely authentically and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.430" end="00:05:35.700" style="s2">in some sense no you&#39;re speaking there</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.200" end="00:05:37.560" style="s2">presumably many of the people watching</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.700" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">have seen it or you know you you guys</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.560" end="00:05:41.340" style="s2">have the luxury of stepping aside and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:43.800" style="s2">watching and I don&#39;t at the moment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.340" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">what what is wrong about it what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.800" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">I don&#39;t and I&#39;m asking that out because</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen it and don&#39;t see anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:49.530" style="s2">wrong but because I actually don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:52.590" style="s2">what&#39;s in it what&#39;s wrong with it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.530" end="00:05:55.380" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t take into account what</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.590" end="00:05:57.660" style="s2">sam harris painstakingly goes through</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.380" end="00:06:00.680" style="s2">which is that our intuitions about what</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.660" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">is going on have very little to do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.680" end="00:06:08.970" style="s2">what the data suggests is going on and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.120" end="00:06:10.710" style="s2">so the point is now I want to be very</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.970" end="00:06:12.900" style="s2">careful that people do not misinterpret</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.710" end="00:06:15.150" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.900" end="00:06:17.130" style="s2">something very real about this moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.150" end="00:06:19.590" style="s2">and this protest and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.130" end="00:06:22.650" style="s2">that&#39;s driving me crazy is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.590" end="00:06:23.310" style="s2">message is so wrong the focus is so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.650" end="00:06:27.020" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.310" end="00:06:30.030" style="s2">that we do not understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.020" end="00:06:31.560" style="s2">tremendous frustration that is boiling</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.030" end="00:06:33.510" style="s2">over in our streets and frankly</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.560" end="00:06:36.860" style="s2">threatening the Republic and maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.510" end="00:06:39.870" style="s2">that that frustration is simply being</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.860" end="00:06:41.550" style="s2">delivered with a false set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.870" end="00:06:45.020" style="s2">labels and so we don&#39;t even know how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.550" end="00:06:48.630" style="s2">interpret it so my point to you is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.020" end="00:06:50.900" style="s2">Chapelle looks at the protest and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.630" end="00:06:53.580" style="s2">says effectively you&#39;re goddamn right</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.900" end="00:06:55.500" style="s2">right of course people are angry of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.580" end="00:06:57.450" style="s2">course they&#39;re angry and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.500" end="00:06:59.910" style="s2">some of these cases that we&#39;ve seen on</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.450" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">video that just seems so upsetting right</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.910" end="00:07:06.810" style="s2">but the problem is that those cases are</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:08.850" style="s2">at best anecdotes and of course even if</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.810" end="00:07:11.850" style="s2">those cases are exactly what we think</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.850" end="00:07:14.220" style="s2">they are the fact that those cases may</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.850" end="00:07:15.870" style="s2">not be disproportionate suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.220" end="00:07:18.300" style="s2">race may not be playing the role that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.870" end="00:07:20.550" style="s2">think it&#39;s play and does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.300" end="00:07:24.780" style="s2">black people are not perceiving some</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.550" end="00:07:26.850" style="s2">sort of substantial obstacle that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.780" end="00:07:29.820" style="s2">blocking progress that I would argue has</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.850" end="00:07:31.980" style="s2">stalled progress no they are detecting</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.820" end="00:07:34.230" style="s2">something and when you see somebody do</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.980" end="00:07:36.420" style="s2">something egregious on videotape and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.230" end="00:07:37.770" style="s2">feel this force holding you back and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.420" end="00:07:40.020" style="s2">put two and two together and you say</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.770" end="00:07:42.780" style="s2">those two things are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.020" end="00:07:44.640" style="s2">right you may not be right it may be</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.780" end="00:07:45.480" style="s2">that those things have nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.640" end="00:07:47.580" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.480" end="00:07:49.170" style="s2">and as I have said before the visceral</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.580" end="00:07:51.210" style="s2">anecdote will always be more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.170" end="00:07:53.820" style="s2">than the dispassionate statistic right</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.210" end="00:07:57.270" style="s2">and if we can take a non-racial example</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.820" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">I said in my talk how the magic trick is</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.270" end="00:08:02.490" style="s2">done that a woman who&#39;s walking down the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:05.430" style="s2">street who takes some look that I give</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.490" end="00:08:08.070" style="s2">her to be full of some kind of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.430" end="00:08:10.290" style="s2">that she finds creepy doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.070" end="00:08:12.870" style="s2">whether it was actually a creepy look or</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.290" end="00:08:14.130" style="s2">am I just awkward and I gave the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.870" end="00:08:16.710" style="s2">walked down the street next to her the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.130" end="00:08:19.410" style="s2">same weird look right you can&#39;t tell if</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.710" end="00:08:23.510" style="s2">all you have is an edit and so what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.410" end="00:08:27.870" style="s2">have is an inherently an inherently</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.510" end="00:08:30.120" style="s2">biased set it is much more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.870" end="00:08:31.950" style="s2">in some sense when the thing matches</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.120" end="00:08:33.840" style="s2">some narrative about some very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.950" end="00:08:35.580" style="s2">force of racism that is alive and well</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.840" end="00:08:37.290" style="s2">in the u.s. and you know what there is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.580" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">force of racism that is alive and well</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.290" end="00:08:41.610" style="s2">in the u.s. but it&#39;s small right most</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:44.340" style="s2">people are not encountering it every day</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.610" end="00:08:46.770" style="s2">the number of you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.340" end="00:08:52.580" style="s2">that Sam reveals is that actually in</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.770" end="00:08:55.850" style="s2">2019 the number of police shootings</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.580" end="00:08:57.290" style="s2">was at an all-time low the number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.850" end="00:08:59.180" style="s2">killings by police in Los Angeles in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.290" end="00:09:00.709" style="s2">2019 was at an all-time low and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.180" end="00:09:01.520" style="s2">there&#39;s something there&#39;s some question</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.709" end="00:09:02.029" style="s2">about are we moving in the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.520" end="00:09:04.220" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.029" end="00:09:06.020" style="s2">are these things racially biased these</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.220" end="00:09:08.750" style="s2">are questions that are addressed by</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.020" end="00:09:11.830" style="s2">tools that we know now here&#39;s the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.750" end="00:09:15.560" style="s2">thing what did we see this last week</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.830" end="00:09:19.339" style="s2">those very tools are under attack shut</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.560" end="00:09:25.670" style="s2">down stem Y is shut down stem marching</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.339" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">with some cartoonish presentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.670" end="00:09:31.730" style="s2">role racism is playing in America</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">because if you have the tools then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.730" end="00:09:35.540" style="s2">can test the claim so those who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:37.970" style="s2">advancing false claims have an interest</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.540" end="00:09:39.500" style="s2">in shutting down those tools shutting</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.970" end="00:09:41.300" style="s2">down any claim that has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.500" end="00:09:45.470" style="s2">demonstrated with them any doubt that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.300" end="00:09:47.570" style="s2">has been established and so well this</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.470" end="00:09:49.610" style="s2">emerges in part I don&#39;t have the quote I</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.570" end="00:09:54.940" style="s2">will I will paraphrase it and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.610" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">I don&#39;t butcher it but the Audrey Lorde</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.940" end="00:09:59.180" style="s2">quotation from I think it will have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:01.100" style="s2">the 1970s in which she says you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.180" end="00:10:04.209" style="s2">you can&#39;t tear down the Masters house</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.100" end="00:10:06.740" style="s2">with the Masters tools now which is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.209" end="00:10:10.220" style="s2">ridiculous and disempowering message</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:12.290" style="s2">actually as as so much of the material</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.220" end="00:10:15.140" style="s2">in the message income coming across the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.290" end="00:10:17.709" style="s2">transom from these these movements these</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.140" end="00:10:20.570" style="s2">so-called anti-racist movements are</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.709" end="00:10:22.310" style="s2">often actually disempowering for exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.570" end="00:10:25.070" style="s2">the populations whom they are purporting</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.310" end="00:10:27.950" style="s2">to try to raise up right and to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.070" end="00:10:33.110" style="s2">extent that so my claim about Chappell</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.950" end="00:10:35.779" style="s2">would be that he is he would present the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.110" end="00:10:38.450" style="s2">story as it really is if he could see it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.779" end="00:10:40.100" style="s2">but he is also subject to a world of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.450" end="00:10:43.700" style="s2">algorithms that have categorized him</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.100" end="00:10:45.320" style="s2">some way and so somehow I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.700" end="00:10:47.930" style="s2">missed the point</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.320" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">but he&#39;s still Dave Chappelle so in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.930" end="00:10:53.180" style="s2">sense as much as I hate to see him</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:56.200" style="s2">present something that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.180" end="00:10:59.270" style="s2">incorrect it&#39;s also hopeful because</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.200" end="00:11:01.880" style="s2">being Dave Chappelle he&#39;s capable of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.270" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">seeing it right and so what would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.880" end="00:11:05.900" style="s2">amazing is if there was a dialog in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:07.630" style="s2">which the point was</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.900" end="00:11:10.100" style="s2">okay Dave we heard what you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.630" end="00:11:12.500" style="s2">here&#39;s the counterpoint that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.100" end="00:11:14.710" style="s2">remarkable dialogue ya know it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.500" end="00:11:14.710" style="s2">would</p>
