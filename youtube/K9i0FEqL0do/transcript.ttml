<p begin="00:02:32.310" end="00:02:36.270" style="s2">the one thing I&#39;d say this book</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:39.150" style="s2">reflected for me as a limitation is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.270" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">the field of cultural evolution in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.150" end="00:02:43.110" style="s2">ways is several decades old but its</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:45.210" style="s2">synthesis of bringing together all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.110" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">parts is only been happening in the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.210" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">few years and one of the pieces that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">still missing is the integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:58.380" style="s2">cognitive sciences with these social and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">evolutionary sciences so specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.380" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">the work that I&#39;ve done on cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">linguistics or the way that the human</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">mind shapes meaning and how shared</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">language can create political agendas</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">and shaped social reality there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.660" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">great richness of findings in</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">linguistics psychology neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">other related fields that is not being</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">reflected in the field of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">evolution yet so that&#39;s a place where</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">those of us who do work in marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">public relations in the design of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:30.240" style="s2">communications to see how to spread</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.780" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">that we can learn from them so for for</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.240" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">our efforts to systematize the research</p>
