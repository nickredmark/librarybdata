<p begin="00:00:02.760" end="00:00:07.950" style="s2">to start so it cuts me off mid-sentence</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">every time but today for the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.950" end="00:00:12.480" style="s2">I&#39;m joined by Jessica and our question</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:14.370" style="s2">we&#39;re discussing because I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:17.490" style="s2">remember the exact wording is how does</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.370" end="00:00:20.789" style="s2">your sexual / romantic orientation</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:22.439" style="s2">affect your worldview there&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.789" end="00:00:25.109" style="s2">slightly different format to the World</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.439" end="00:00:27.769" style="s2">Cafe going forward the World Cafe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.109" end="00:00:30.689" style="s2">what this is based on but the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.769" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">because I want there to be a different</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.689" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">format it works better to find one</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.759" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">person to have a conversation with we</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:40.200" style="s2">together craft a question that we want</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">to discuss figure out a time that works</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.200" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">for us and then put it out into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:47.070" style="s2">community to see who else wants to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">participate so there&#39;s always at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.070" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">two of us and potentially more and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">will always be a question that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">talk about and the other person so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:59.129" style="s2">think that this is ideal</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">all right so would you like to go first</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.129" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">Jessica answering the question then</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:07.490" style="s2">would you like rated course yes well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">think we have a similar style in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.490" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">relationship and romantic outlook so</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m gonna steal all the good</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">points so yeah I&#39;ll good oh yes oh well</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">so we&#39;ll do that brief five minutes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">okay so well so I think there&#39;s two two</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">things about my sexuality and like</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">romantic life that kind of have their</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">own separate distinct things and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">they also have like um I like emergent</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">properties because they both exist for</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">me so I&#39;m bisexual</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:47.729" style="s2">and I&#39;m polyamorous so those two things</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">kind of mesh well quite well to create a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.729" end="00:01:52.049" style="s2">kind of different worldview so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">the UM the bisexuality the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.049" end="00:01:59.130" style="s2">was huge for me was having a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">strong empathy for people especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.130" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">when it comes to gender because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:07.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a really interesting time when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">have to like step outside of a role</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.670" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">potentially like especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t identify as bi for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:15.090" style="s2">then do so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve been trying to be romantically</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.090" end="00:02:19.770" style="s2">engaged with one gender and then you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:23.010" style="s2">they&#39;re not trying to be romantically</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.770" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">engaged with another gent so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.010" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">suddenly see what it&#39;s like from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:28.440" style="s2">other side of the mirror where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:31.740" style="s2">trying to yeah you&#39;re trying to engage</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.440" end="00:02:34.440" style="s2">in like romantic stuff with a gender</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:37.260" style="s2">that you&#39;re not used to so you suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.440" end="00:02:39.050" style="s2">see how hard it must be for the people</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.260" end="00:02:41.490" style="s2">who have been trying to engage with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.050" end="00:02:44.310" style="s2">as well so yes so it&#39;s kind of like an</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.490" end="00:02:46.890" style="s2">empathy for gender roles and then once</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.310" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">you kind of look at gender a lot you</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.890" end="00:02:50.850" style="s2">start seeing that the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">kind of has like gender blind spots so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.850" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;ve been joking</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">about in my house in the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:03:00.470" style="s2">weeks is um segregating into single</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">gender like toilets and changing rooms</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.470" end="00:03:07.710" style="s2">like thinking that that eliminates any</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">kind of sexual pressure because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.710" end="00:03:15.330" style="s2">world is hetero like ha ha ha you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">you&#39;re safe but you&#39;re not so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.330" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">few like gender blind spots there so</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the buy-side and then the poly</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">side actually the biggest thing for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">was it was the first encounter I&#39;d had</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">with their concept of abundance versus</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">scarcity which is interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:37.230" style="s2">you do see abundance around quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:39.450" style="s2">in in some of the circles that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.230" end="00:03:44.070" style="s2">like so called like hippy view of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.450" end="00:03:46.050" style="s2">world and this idea that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.070" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">sharing out a scarce resource you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.050" end="00:03:50.580" style="s2">like the more you use something like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.850" style="s2">more of the resource that you you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.580" end="00:03:56.310" style="s2">or the more that you can generate so</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.850" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">poor emery obviously says that with love</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.310" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">and affection and attention so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">was actually quite shocked to remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:04.860" style="s2">to realize that that was the point oh he</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:06.630" style="s2">was the first time I&#39;d come across</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.860" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2">abundance because I think abundance is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.630" end="00:04:10.860" style="s2">really important and really lovely for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:13.580" style="s2">like the world moving forward trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.860" end="00:04:16.350" style="s2">be in an abundant place</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.580" end="00:04:19.940" style="s2">and I guess some subsidiary stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">being polyamorous is a awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.940" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">roles like a relationship roles as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:26.370" style="s2">as gender roles so this is how this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">how it goes well together cuz you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.370" end="00:04:28.710" style="s2">kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:30.449" style="s2">Durrell&#39;s with the by stuff but then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.710" end="00:04:33.000" style="s2">have like relationship roles with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.449" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">poly stuff so you suddenly realized that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.000" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">if sex isn&#39;t the only way to be faithful</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2">to someone or it&#39;s no longer the way you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:42.690" style="s2">show your faithfulness then what does</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:45.960" style="s2">faithfulness mean so you sort of start</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.690" end="00:04:47.909" style="s2">looking at like romantic life and but</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.960" end="00:04:50.099" style="s2">and sexual life as being separate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.909" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">then maybe friendship life and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.099" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">domestic life so these are all they used</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:58.530" style="s2">to be or bundled and now they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:05:02.460" style="s2">unbundled so yeah I think it I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.530" end="00:05:04.889" style="s2">there&#39;s more granularity to life with</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.460" end="00:05:08.009" style="s2">when you have to live in a polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.889" end="00:05:12.840" style="s2">way those are my yeah I think there&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.009" end="00:05:14.159" style="s2">main points what about you do you Thank</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.840" end="00:05:16.650" style="s2">You Jessica you stole it all I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.159" end="00:05:19.219" style="s2">possibly talk five minutes sexualities</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.650" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">all we got for the whole world that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.219" end="00:05:25.229" style="s2">I am similarly I don&#39;t even know what my</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:27.629" style="s2">light labels are because there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.229" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">labels kind of in my head more so than</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.629" end="00:05:34.680" style="s2">in actual reality I thought I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">straight for a very long time and when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.680" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">came out to myself I came out to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">world because I&#39;m not someone who lives</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:43.740" style="s2">in closet so like I was watching orange</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">is the new black four or five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.740" end="00:05:47.729" style="s2">and there was this really sweet see and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">I remember who was between who say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.729" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">sure and so and I was like oh I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:54.990" style="s2">go to prison and have a girl friends and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:57.419" style="s2">I was like that&#39;s not a straight thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.990" end="00:06:01.949" style="s2">like I was like oh yeah girlfriend and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.419" end="00:06:05.490" style="s2">not go to prison right for allowing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.949" end="00:06:07.590" style="s2">then and because it kind of opened up I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:10.050" style="s2">realized all the ways I was labeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.590" end="00:06:11.699" style="s2">myself as straight because I fit in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.050" end="00:06:14.580" style="s2">box and I didn&#39;t like certain things I</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.699" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">liked other things once that broke open</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.580" end="00:06:19.919" style="s2">it broke open like that intertwined if</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:22.139" style="s2">like gender and sexuality and roles in</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.919" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">all of exactly what you were saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.139" end="00:06:26.909" style="s2">I was like oh god like I had such</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:28.979" style="s2">stringent rules on dating men that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.909" end="00:06:30.779" style="s2">very rigid now I can see the very tied</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.979" end="00:06:33.270" style="s2">to my autism which I also didn&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.779" end="00:06:35.669" style="s2">out too much later but like he&#39;s got to</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.540" end="00:21:05.070" style="s2">think that some people think that makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.010" end="00:21:08.190" style="s2">it quite kind of cold seeming when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.070" end="00:21:14.220" style="s2">compare it to monogamy that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.190" end="00:21:15.960" style="s2">codependent but it seems to why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.220" end="00:21:18.840" style="s2">necessary to function when it&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.960" end="00:21:20.250" style="s2">of just one person I think or you or you</p>
