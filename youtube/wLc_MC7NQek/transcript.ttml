<p begin="00:00:08.599" end="00:00:12.160" style="s2">[Music]<br />all right so I suggested to you last</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:18.090" style="s2">class that human beings world as a place<br />of action through the lens of their</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.090" end="00:00:26.830" style="s2">social cognitive biological sub<br />structure and I made that argument on</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.830" end="00:00:34.710" style="s2">the basis of the supposition that our<br />primary environment was actually other</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:40.260" style="s2">people and I mentioned to you I believe<br />that those other people are arranged in</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.260" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">hierarchies of influence and authority<br />or power or dominance which is often how</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:52.120" style="s2">its construed and that the dominance<br />hierarchy as a structure is at least 300</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.120" end="00:00:56.460" style="s2">million years old<br />which makes it older than trees and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.460" end="00:01:02.739" style="s2">for that reason that you share the same<br />neural biology to govern your</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.739" end="00:01:09.200" style="s2">observations of your position in the<br />hierarchy as lobsters do which is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:13.670" style="s2">remarkable fact you know it&#39;s a<br />remarkable that the lobster uses</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.670" end="00:01:20.509" style="s2">serotonin as the mechanism to adjudicate<br />its status position and that modifying</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.509" end="00:01:26.530" style="s2">the serotonin function in the lobster<br />can produce changes in its behavior can</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.530" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">can / help the logs to overcome defeat<br />for example which is very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">equivalent to what happens to a human<br />being when they take antidepressants you</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:41.750" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a good example of<br />the conservation of biological structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.750" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">by evolution and another a good<br />illustration of the continuity of life</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">on Earth it&#39;s really amazing but the<br />other thing it is a testament to is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:55.159" style="s2">ancient nature of the social structure<br />now we tend to think of the social</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.159" end="00:02:00.219" style="s2">structure as something other than nature<br />right because society is I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.219" end="00:02:06.219" style="s2">mythologically opposed it&#39;s opposed in a<br />narrative way cultures opposed to nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.219" end="00:02:12.850" style="s2">it&#39;s the town in the forest but the town<br />has been around a long time so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.850" end="00:02:17.230" style="s2">and the structure of the town is also<br />part of nature in that the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.230" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">hierarchy is part of<br />and because it&#39;s so ancient you have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:28.030" style="s2">consider it as part of the mechanism<br />that has played the role of selection in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.030" end="00:02:34.810" style="s2">the process of natural selection and so<br />roughly seem what seems to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.810" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">that there is a plethora of dominance<br />hierarchies especially in complex human</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">communities and many of them are<br />masculine in structure in that their</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:50.530" style="s2">dominance are keys that primarily men<br />compete in or that has been the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.530" end="00:02:56.260" style="s2">historical norm and that some men rise<br />to the top based on whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.260" end="00:03:02.890" style="s2">dominance hierarchy is based on and they<br />make their preferential mates and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.890" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">good strategy for women to engage in<br />because why and many sorts of female</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:13.080" style="s2">animals do precisely this is they let<br />the male&#39;s battle it out and then pick</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.080" end="00:03:20.380" style="s2">from the top and or often the dominant<br />males there&#39;s no choice on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.380" end="00:03:24.830" style="s2">the females it&#39;s the dominant males just<br />chasing away the subordinate males but</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.830" end="00:03:29.960" style="s2">with humans it&#39;s usually the case that<br />the females have the opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.960" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">at least some choosing and so we have if<br />you think about that what that implies</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:41.580" style="s2">is that we have evolved to climb up<br />dominance hierarchies and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.580" end="00:03:46.540" style="s2">say it&#39;s not exactly that even because<br />there are many different dominance</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.540" end="00:03:50.890" style="s2">hierarchies and so the skills that you<br />might use to climb up one might not be</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.890" end="00:03:54.730" style="s2">necessarily the same skills that you<br />would use to climb up another and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.730" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">then I would say what we have all<br />evolved for instead and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">speaking mostly on the masculine edge of<br />things historically speaking is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">ability to climb up the set of all<br />possible dominance hierarchies right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole different idea<br />it&#39;s like the averaged hierarchy across</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.709" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">vast spans of time and I think it&#39;s for<br />that reason that we among others that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:27.010" style="s2">evolve general intelligence because<br />general intelligence is a general</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.010" end="00:04:31.980" style="s2">problem-solving mechanism and it seems<br />to be situation in depend</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.980" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">so to speak and of course there&#39;s been<br />an arms race for the development of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:41.070" style="s2">intelligence between men and women<br />because each gender has to keep up with</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.070" end="00:04:44.940" style="s2">the other and women have their own<br />dominance hierarchies there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.940" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">no doubt about that<br />and of course now men and women more</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:53.530" style="s2">increasingly compete within the same<br />hierarchies and we don&#39;t exactly know</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.530" end="00:04:57.850" style="s2">how to sort that out yet because it&#39;s an<br />extraordinarily new phenomena but in any</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.850" end="00:05:06.950" style="s2">case because of the the permanence of<br />the dominance hierarchy it has come to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.950" end="00:05:11.510" style="s2">be represented in fundamental narratives<br />because human beings and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.510" end="00:05:15.740" style="s2">something that we share everywhere it&#39;s<br />the thing the Wall Street bankers shares</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:26.040" style="s2">with with the kalahari Kung Bushmen who<br />are among the genetically speaking they</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.040" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">seem to be very close to what the<br />original most original human beings were</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:36.990" style="s2">like in Africa before the Diaspora about<br />fifty thousand years ago but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.990" end="00:05:41.410" style="s2">both of those people<br />despite their vast differences live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.410" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">communities that have a hierarchical<br />structure that are composed of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:50.430" style="s2">individuals that are embedded in a<br />natural world you know the world outside</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.430" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">of the dominant Sarki and so that&#39;s the<br />standard human environment I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:05:59.900" style="s2">and so stories that rely on the<br />representations of those environments</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.900" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">and their interactions are what you<br />might describe as universal stories and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:09.900" style="s2">that&#39;s why people can understand them<br />and I would say further and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.900" end="00:06:15.139" style="s2">drawing substantially on say derivation<br />of the work of Carl Jung because I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.139" end="00:06:18.370" style="s2">he delved into this more deeply than<br />anyone else so a lot of this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.370" end="00:06:29.561" style="s2">quite Union in its in its origins we the<br />commonality between human beings so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.561" end="00:06:33.590" style="s2">know you have to have commonalities in<br />order to communicate right axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.590" end="00:06:38.950" style="s2">commonalities because otherwise you have<br />to explain everything and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.950" end="00:06:42.500" style="s2">many things that human beings don&#39;t have<br />to explain to one another we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.500" end="00:06:46.830" style="s2">to explain anger we do<br />have to explain jealousy we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.830" end="00:06:51.970" style="s2">to explain fear we don&#39;t have to explain<br />pain we don&#39;t have to explain joy we</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.970" end="00:06:56.600" style="s2">don&#39;t have to explain love etc those are<br />built into us and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.600" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">predicates of being human and you could<br />say that those human predicates and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:06.590" style="s2">standard human environment produce<br />standard narratives and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.590" end="00:07:12.169" style="s2">say even further and this is more of a<br />leap I would say is that those who act</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.169" end="00:07:17.910" style="s2">out the role of the victor in those<br />standard narratives are precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.910" end="00:07:24.910" style="s2">people who attain victory in life and I<br />would say biologically defined in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.910" end="00:07:29.410" style="s2">they make more attractive partners but<br />also I believe that there&#39;s an alignment</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.410" end="00:07:35.910" style="s2">between human well-being which is a very<br />weak word and participation in these</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.910" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">meta narratives that drive success<br />because well do you want to be a failure</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:45.389" style="s2">or a success well you know it&#39;s hard to<br />be a success you have to adopt a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.389" end="00:07:48.841" style="s2">responsibility and so you might be<br />willing to take your chances as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.841" end="00:07:53.270" style="s2">failure but I can&#39;t exactly I&#39;m not<br />going to make the presumption that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.270" end="00:07:58.860" style="s2">that&#39;s going to put you in a situation<br />other than one where you experienced a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.860" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">lot of frustration anger disappointment<br />depression pain and anxiety at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:09.139" style="s2">bottom of the heap and so generally<br />that&#39;s not what people are aiming for</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.139" end="00:08:15.871" style="s2">although under certain circumstances if<br />people don&#39;t like responsibility and are</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.871" end="00:08:23.260" style="s2">willing to take their chances they might<br />take the irresponsibility and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.260" end="00:08:27.330" style="s2">apparent freedoms over the necessity of<br />thinking things through the medium and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.330" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">long run anyways we stop here I<br />suggested to you that one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">narrative representations was the known<br />or culture or order I think those or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:44.850" style="s2">explored territory or the dominance arc<br />I think those things are basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.850" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">interchangeable from from a<br />representational perspective and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:55.459" style="s2">know in the movie The Lion King that&#39;s<br />represented by Pride Rock which is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.459" end="00:08:59.309" style="s2">central place of orientation founded on<br />Raw</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.309" end="00:09:03.649" style="s2">which is the sort of thing that people<br />embed their memories in that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.649" end="00:09:07.910" style="s2">make sculptures and gravestones and that<br />sort of things rock stands for permanent</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.910" end="00:09:13.079" style="s2">and to have rock under your feet as to<br />be on a solid foundation and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.079" end="00:09:17.779" style="s2">pyramid in some sense in that movie and<br />the pyramid has topped by you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.779" end="00:09:23.139" style="s2">king and queen and they&#39;re their<br />offspring so that&#39;s that&#39;s the divine</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.139" end="00:09:27.939" style="s2">couple that&#39;s one way of thinking about<br />it and Simba of course is the newborn</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.939" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">hero and you know you extend that even<br />though it&#39;s lions and drawings of lions</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:38.579" style="s2">at that and animals are acting it out<br />it&#39;s completely irrelevant to you that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.579" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">those characters happen to be animated<br />and that what you&#39;re watching is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:48.790" style="s2">fiction so and I would say to you with<br />regards to fiction you know you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.790" end="00:09:56.190" style="s2">say well is fiction true or not and the<br />answer to that is yes and no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.190" end="00:10:02.809" style="s2">true in that the events portrayed in<br />fiction occurred in the world they</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.809" end="00:10:08.939" style="s2">didn&#39;t but they&#39;re fiction is true the<br />same way numbers are true I would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.939" end="00:10:15.290" style="s2">like you know if you have one apple and<br />one orange and one banana the common</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.290" end="00:10:20.949" style="s2">analogy between all of those three is<br />one and you might say well is one as</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.949" end="00:10:27.800" style="s2">real as one fruit is the abstraction one<br />as real as one fruit and I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.800" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">depends on what you mean by real but<br />representing things mathematically and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.540" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">abstractly gives you incredible power<br />and you could make the case that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:42.540" style="s2">abstraction is actually more real than<br />the phenomena that it represents and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.540" end="00:10:47.470" style="s2">certainly mathematicians would make that<br />case they would say that mathematics is</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.470" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">in some sense more real than the<br />phenomenal world and you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:56.040" style="s2">have to believe that mostly it&#39;s a<br />matter of choice in some sense but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.040" end="00:11:00.551" style="s2">can&#39;t deny the fact that an abstraction<br />has enough reality so that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.551" end="00:11:06.850" style="s2">proficient in using it you can really<br />you can change the world and in and in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.850" end="00:11:11.100" style="s2">insanely powerful ways you know I mean<br />all the computational equipment you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.100" end="00:11:15.319" style="s2">people are using or depending<br />on the abstractions one and zero</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.319" end="00:11:20.060" style="s2">essentially and I mean look at what<br />emerges from that and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.060" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">with regards to fiction if you take<br />someone like Dostoyevsky oh I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:27.579" style="s2">a favorite of mine by the way I would<br />highly recommend that you read all five</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.579" end="00:11:31.709" style="s2">of his great novels because they are<br />unparalleled in their psychological</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.709" end="00:11:37.720" style="s2">depth and so if you&#39;re interested in<br />psychology Dostoyevsky&#39;s the person for</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.720" end="00:11:40.730" style="s2">you<br />Tolstoy is more of a sociologist but</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.730" end="00:11:45.290" style="s2">Dostoyevsky man he gets right down into<br />the bottom of the questions and messes</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.290" end="00:11:53.059" style="s2">around transformative reading anyways<br />Dostoyevsky&#39;s characters this character</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.059" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">named her skull in the Cobb is a<br />character in crime and punishment and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:02.339" style="s2">Raskolnikov is a materialist rationalist<br />I would say which was a rather new type</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.339" end="00:12:08.709" style="s2">of person back in the 1880s and he was<br />sort of taken by the idea that God was</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.709" end="00:12:15.329" style="s2">dead and took and convinced himself that<br />the only reason that he that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.329" end="00:12:19.509" style="s2">acted in a moral way in a traditional<br />way was because of cowardice they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.509" end="00:12:25.899" style="s2">unable to remove from them the<br />restrictions of mere convention and act</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.899" end="00:12:32.810" style="s2">in the manner of someone who rose above<br />the norm and so he&#39;s tortured by these</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.810" end="00:12:36.989" style="s2">ideas he&#39;s half starving he&#39;s a law<br />student he doesn&#39;t have enough to eat he</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.989" end="00:12:40.309" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have much money and so you know<br />he&#39;s not thinking all that clearly</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.309" end="00:12:44.360" style="s2">either and he&#39;s got a lot of family<br />problems his mother&#39;s sick and she can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.360" end="00:12:49.220" style="s2">spend him send a much money and his<br />sister is planning to engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.220" end="00:12:53.529" style="s2">marriage that&#39;s loveless to someone<br />who&#39;s rather tyrannical who he hopes</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.529" end="00:12:57.089" style="s2">will provide the family with enough<br />money so that he can continue in law</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.089" end="00:13:02.170" style="s2">school and they write him brave letters<br />telling him that she&#39;s very much in love</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.170" end="00:13:06.389" style="s2">with this guy but he is smart enough to<br />read between the lines and realizes that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.389" end="00:13:10.589" style="s2">his sister is just planning to<br />prostitute herself in you know in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.589" end="00:13:16.259" style="s2">altruistic manner he&#39;s not very happy<br />with that and then at the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.259" end="00:13:22.230" style="s2">all this is happening he becomes aware<br />of this pawnbroker who he&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.230" end="00:13:26.649" style="s2">pawning his last possessions to and<br />she&#39;s a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.649" end="00:13:32.429" style="s2">person and not only by his estimation<br />she pawns a lot of things for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.429" end="00:13:36.250" style="s2">neighborhood and people really don&#39;t<br />like her she&#39;s grasping and cruel and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.250" end="00:13:42.699" style="s2">deceitful and and resentful and like and<br />she has this niece who&#39;s not very bright</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.699" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">intellectually impaired whom she<br />basically treats as a slave and beats</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:53.379" style="s2">all the time and so Raskolnikov you know<br />involved in this mess and half starved</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.379" end="00:13:59.540" style="s2">and a bit delirious and possessed of<br />these strange new nihilistic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.540" end="00:14:04.179" style="s2">decides that the best way out of this<br />situation would be just to kill the land</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.179" end="00:14:10.809" style="s2">let the pawnbroker take her wealth which<br />he all she does is keep it in a chest</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.809" end="00:14:17.050" style="s2">free the niece so that seems like a good<br />idea so remove one apparently horrible</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.050" end="00:14:21.350" style="s2">and useless person from the world free<br />his sister from the necessity of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.350" end="00:14:25.850" style="s2">loveless marriage and allow him to go to<br />law school where he can become educated</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.850" end="00:14:30.110" style="s2">and do some good for the world you know<br />so one of the things that&#39;s lovely about</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.110" end="00:14:35.220" style="s2">Dostoyevsky is that he you know when<br />sometimes when one person is arguing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.220" end="00:14:39.819" style="s2">against another or when they&#39;re having<br />an argument in their head they make</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.819" end="00:14:43.949" style="s2">their opponent into a straw man which is<br />basically they take their opponent and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.949" end="00:14:48.839" style="s2">curricular their perspective and try to<br />make it as weak as possible and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.839" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">laugh about it and and then they come up<br />with their argument and destroy this</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:59.179" style="s2">straw man and feel that they&#39;ve obtained<br />victory but it&#39;s a very pathetic way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.179" end="00:15:04.819" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s not thinking at all what<br />thinking is is when you adopt the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.819" end="00:15:09.809" style="s2">opposite position from your suppositions<br />and you make that argument as strong as</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.809" end="00:15:14.619" style="s2">you can possibly make it<br />and then you pit your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.619" end="00:15:23.299" style="s2">against that that strong iron man not<br />the straw man and you argue it out you</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.299" end="00:15:27.889" style="s2">battle it out and that&#39;s what Dostoevsky<br />does in his novels I mean he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.889" end="00:15:32.499" style="s2">people who stand for the antithesis of<br />what dust is dust is he actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.499" end="00:15:37.670" style="s2">believes are often the strongest<br />smartest and sometimes most admirable</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.670" end="00:15:44.040" style="s2">people in the book and so<br />takes great moral courage to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.040" end="00:15:47.749" style="s2">you know in risk Olenick oov what he<br />wanted to do was set up a character who</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.749" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">had every reason to commit murder every<br />reasonable reason philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:16:01.009" style="s2">practically ethically even well so risk<br />Olenick off goes and he kills the old</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.009" end="00:16:05.730" style="s2">lady with an axe and it doesn&#39;t go the<br />way he expects it will because what he</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.730" end="00:16:11.309" style="s2">finds out is that post murder<br />Raskolnikov and pre murder Raskolnikov</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.309" end="00:16:16.799" style="s2">are not the same people at all they&#39;re<br />not even close to the same people he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.799" end="00:16:21.420" style="s2">entered an entirely different universe<br />and Dostoevsky does a lovely job of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.420" end="00:16:29.750" style="s2">describing that universe of horror and<br />chaos and and and deception and and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.750" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">suffering and terror and all of that and<br />he doesn&#39;t even use the money he just</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:37.790" style="s2">buries it in a and an alley as fast as<br />he can and then doesn&#39;t want anything to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.790" end="00:16:43.420" style="s2">do with it again and anyways the reason<br />I&#39;m telling you all this is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.420" end="00:16:47.579" style="s2">to entice you into reading the book<br />because it is an amazing amazing book</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.579" end="00:16:52.769" style="s2">but also because you might say well his<br />risk is what happened to Raskolnikov</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.769" end="00:16:58.089" style="s2">true are the stories in that book true<br />and the answer to that is well from a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.089" end="00:17:01.799" style="s2">factual perspective clearly they&#39;re<br />untrue but then if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.799" end="00:17:06.959" style="s2">Raskolnikov as the embodiment of a<br />particular type of person who lived at</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.959" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">that time and the embodiment of a<br />certain kind of ideology which had swept</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:16.620" style="s2">across Europe and really invaded Russia<br />and which was actually a precursor a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.620" end="00:17:21.769" style="s2">philosophical precursor to the Russian<br />Revolution then Raskolnikov is more real</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.769" end="00:17:27.240" style="s2">than any one person he&#39;s like a<br />composite person he&#39;s like a person</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.240" end="00:17:33.640" style="s2">who&#39;s irrelevant sees have been<br />eliminated for the purpose of relating</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.640" end="00:17:36.950" style="s2">something about the structure of the<br />world and so I like to think of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.950" end="00:17:42.570" style="s2">things as sort of meta real meta real<br />they&#39;re more real than real and of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.570" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">course that&#39;s what you expect people to<br />do when they tell you about their own</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:53.850" style="s2">lives about their own day you don&#39;t want<br />a factual description of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.850" end="00:18:01.930" style="s2">every muscle twitch you want them to<br />distill their experiences down into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.930" end="00:18:06.850" style="s2">gist which is the significance of the<br />experience and the significance of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.850" end="00:18:13.059" style="s2">experience is roughly what you can<br />derive from listening to the experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.059" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">that will change the way that you look<br />at the world and act in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:21.909" style="s2">it&#39;s valuable information and they can<br />tell you a terrible story and then that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.909" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">can be valuable because that can tell<br />you how not to look in the world look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:30.120" style="s2">the world and act in it or they can tell<br />you a positive story you can derive</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.120" end="00:18:34.870" style="s2">benefit either way which is why we also<br />like to go watch stories about horrible</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.870" end="00:18:40.450" style="s2">psychopathic thugs you know and and<br />hopefully we&#39;re learning not to be like</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.450" end="00:18:46.610" style="s2">them although there are additional<br />advantages in that you know someone you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.610" end="00:18:51.620" style="s2">might be some say that someone who is<br />incapable of cruelty is a higher moral</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.620" end="00:18:55.690" style="s2">being than someone who is capable of<br />cruelty and I would say and this follows</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.690" end="00:19:00.700" style="s2">young as well that that&#39;s incorrect and<br />it&#39;s dangerously incorrect because if</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.700" end="00:19:07.820" style="s2">you are not capable of cruelty you are<br />absolutely a victim to anyone who is and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.820" end="00:19:12.419" style="s2">so part of the reason that people go<br />watch anti heroes and villains is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.419" end="00:19:17.090" style="s2">because there&#39;s a part of them crying<br />out for the incorporation of the monster</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.090" end="00:19:21.309" style="s2">within them which is what gives them<br />strength of character and self-respect</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.309" end="00:19:26.070" style="s2">because it&#39;s impossible to respect<br />yourself until you grow teeth and if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.070" end="00:19:30.230" style="s2">grow teeth and you realize that you&#39;re<br />somewhat dangerous and let or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.230" end="00:19:35.309" style="s2">somewhat seriously dangerous and then<br />you might be more willing to demand that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.309" end="00:19:40.039" style="s2">you treat yourself with respect and<br />other people do the same thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.039" end="00:19:44.179" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that being cruel is<br />better than not being cruel what it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.179" end="00:19:49.850" style="s2">means is that being able to be cruel and<br />then not being cruel is better than not</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.850" end="00:19:53.970" style="s2">being able to be cruel because in the<br />first case you&#39;re nothing but weak and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.970" end="00:19:59.480" style="s2">naive and in the second case you&#39;re<br />dangerous but you have it under control</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.480" end="00:20:03.470" style="s2">and you know a lot of martial arts<br />concentrate on exactly that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.470" end="00:20:07.529" style="s2">their philosophy of training it&#39;s like<br />we&#39;re not training you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.529" end="00:20:14.110" style="s2">to fight we&#39;re training you to be<br />peaceful and awake and avoid fights but</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.110" end="00:20:18.780" style="s2">if you happen to have to get in one and<br />then I guess the philosophy also is is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.780" end="00:20:24.929" style="s2">that if you&#39;re competent at fighting<br />that actually decreases the probability</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.929" end="00:20:28.990" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to have to fight<br />because when someone pushes you you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.990" end="00:20:32.809" style="s2">be able to respond with confidence and<br />with any luck and this is certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.809" end="00:20:36.909" style="s2">case with bullies with any lock a<br />reasonable show of confidence which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.909" end="00:20:40.700" style="s2">very much equivalent to the show of<br />dominance is going to be enough to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.700" end="00:20:46.409" style="s2">the bully back off and so the strength<br />that you develop in your monstrousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.409" end="00:20:50.870" style="s2">is actually the best guarantee of peace<br />and that&#39;s partly why Jung believed that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.870" end="00:20:55.410" style="s2">it was necessary for people to integrate<br />their shadow and he said that was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.410" end="00:21:01.169" style="s2">terrible thing for people to attempt<br />because the human shadow mmm which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.169" end="00:21:05.240" style="s2">all those things about yourself that you<br />don&#39;t want to realize reaches all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.240" end="00:21:10.059" style="s2">way to hell and what he meant by that<br />was it&#39;s through an analysis of your own</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.059" end="00:21:14.790" style="s2">shadow that you can come to understand<br />why other people are capable and you as</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.790" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">well of the sorts of terrible atrocities<br />that characterize let&#39;s say the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:23.539" style="s2">century and without that understanding<br />there&#39;s no possibility of bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.539" end="00:21:28.600" style="s2">under control when you study Nazi<br />Germany for example or you study the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.600" end="00:21:34.019" style="s2">Soviet Union particularly under Stalin<br />and you&#39;re asking yourself well what are</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.019" end="00:21:37.820" style="s2">these perpetrators like forget about the<br />victims let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.820" end="00:21:42.340" style="s2">perpetrators the answer is they&#39;re just<br />like you and if you don&#39;t know that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.340" end="00:21:46.700" style="s2">just means that you don&#39;t know anything<br />about people including yourself and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.700" end="00:21:51.700" style="s2">it also means that you have to discover<br />why they&#39;re just like you and believe me</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.700" end="00:21:56.150" style="s2">that&#39;s no picnic so that&#39;s enough to<br />traumatize people and that&#39;s partly why</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.150" end="00:22:01.149" style="s2">they don&#39;t do it and it&#39;s also partly<br />why the path to enlightenment and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.149" end="00:22:06.309" style="s2">is seldom trod upon because if it was<br />all a matter of following your bliss and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.309" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">doing what made you happy then everyone<br />in the world would be a paragon of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:14.789" style="s2">wisdom but it&#39;s not that at all it&#39;s the<br />it&#39;s a matter of facing the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.789" end="00:22:19.960" style="s2">least want to face and everyone has that<br />old there&#39;s this old story in King</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.960" end="00:22:22.690" style="s2">Arthur where<br />the night&#39;s go off to look for the Holy</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.690" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">Grail which is either the cup that<br />Christ drank out of it the Last Supper</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:32.389" style="s2">or the cup into which the blood that<br />gushed from his side was poured when he</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.389" end="00:22:37.830" style="s2">was crucified the stories vary but it&#39;s<br />it&#39;s basically a holy object like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.830" end="00:22:41.620" style="s2">Phoenix in some sense that&#39;s<br />representation a representation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.620" end="00:22:47.059" style="s2">transformation so it&#39;s a it&#39;s an ideal<br />and so King Arthur&#39;s knights who sit at</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.059" end="00:22:51.020" style="s2">a round table because they&#39;re all<br />roughly equal go off to find the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.020" end="00:22:55.929" style="s2">valuable thing and they and where do you<br />look for the most valuable thing when</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.929" end="00:23:00.269" style="s2">you don&#39;t know where it is well each of<br />the knights looks at the forest</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.269" end="00:23:04.530" style="s2">surrounding the castle and enters the<br />forest at the point that looks darkest</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.530" end="00:23:10.809" style="s2">to him and that&#39;s a good thing to<br />understand because the gateway to wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.809" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">and the gateway to the development of<br />personality which is exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:19.429" style="s2">thing is precisely through the porthole<br />portal that you do not want to climb</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.429" end="00:23:23.590" style="s2">through and the reason for that&#39;s<br />actually quite technical this is a union</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.590" end="00:23:27.640" style="s2">presupposition - is that well there&#39;s a<br />bunch of things about you that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.640" end="00:23:30.840" style="s2">underdeveloped and a lot of those things<br />are because there&#39;s things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.840" end="00:23:34.370" style="s2">avoided looking at because you don&#39;t<br />want to look at them and there&#39;s parts</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.370" end="00:23:38.870" style="s2">of you you&#39;ve avoided developing because<br />it&#39;s hard for you to develop those parts</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.870" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">and so it&#39;s by virtual necessity that<br />what you need is where you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:49.140" style="s2">look because that&#39;s where you&#39;ve kept it<br />and so and that&#39;s why there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.140" end="00:23:53.799" style="s2">an idiosyncratic element of it for<br />everyone your particular place of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.799" end="00:23:57.940" style="s2">enlightenment and terror is not going to<br />be the same as yours except that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.940" end="00:24:02.850" style="s2">both places of enlightenment and terror<br />so they&#39;re equivalent at one level of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.850" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">analysis and and different than another<br />so anyways back to the fiction and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:14.149" style="s2">and and what it does if it distills<br />truth and it produces characters that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.149" end="00:24:19.620" style="s2">are composites and the more they become<br />composites the more they approximate a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.620" end="00:24:25.590" style="s2">mythological character and so they<br />become more and more universally true</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.590" end="00:24:29.669" style="s2">and more and more approximating<br />religious deities but the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.669" end="00:24:33.759" style="s2">that is they become more and more<br />distant from individual experience and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.759" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">so with<br />literature there&#39;s this very tight line</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:45.250" style="s2">where you need to make the character<br />more than merely human but not so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.250" end="00:24:50.030" style="s2">of a God that you know one of the things<br />that happened to Superman in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.030" end="00:24:53.929" style="s2">Superman started out he&#39;s got a heavenly<br />set a parents by the way in an earthly</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.929" end="00:24:58.909" style="s2">set of parents and he&#39;s an orphan like<br />Harry Potter very common theme is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.909" end="00:25:02.529" style="s2">when Superman first emerged he could<br />only jump out of her buildings you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.529" end="00:25:06.789" style="s2">and maybe he could stop a locomotive but<br />by the time the 1980s rolled around like</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.789" end="00:25:11.710" style="s2">he could juggle planets and you know<br />swallow hydrogen bombs and you know he</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.710" end="00:25:15.809" style="s2">could do anything well people stopped<br />buying the Superman comics because how</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.809" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">interesting is that it&#39;s like something<br />horrible happens and Superman deals with</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:25.419" style="s2">it and something else horrible happens<br />and Superman deals with it and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.419" end="00:25:30.200" style="s2">that&#39;s dull he turned into such an<br />archetype he was basically the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.200" end="00:25:38.720" style="s2">omniscient omnipresent omnipotent God<br />and that&#39;s no fun it&#39;s like God wins and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:43.379" style="s2">then God wins again and then again God<br />wins and you know so then they had to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.379" end="00:25:47.129" style="s2">weaken him in different ways with<br />kryptonite you know so green kryptonite</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.129" end="00:25:51.570" style="s2">kind of made him sick and red kryptonite<br />I think kind of mutated him if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.570" end="00:25:55.289" style="s2">remember correctly and anyways they had<br />to introduce flaws into his characters</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.289" end="00:25:59.110" style="s2">so that there could be some damn plot<br />and that&#39;s something to think about you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.110" end="00:26:05.289" style="s2">know there&#39;s a deep existential lesson<br />in that in that your being is limited</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.289" end="00:26:12.340" style="s2">and flawed and fragile you&#39;re like the<br />genie which is genius in the little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.340" end="00:26:16.460" style="s2">in the little tiny lamp<br />you know this immense potential but</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.460" end="00:26:20.919" style="s2">constrained in this tiny little living<br />space as Robin Williams said when he</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.919" end="00:26:26.220" style="s2">played the genie in Aladdin but the fact<br />that you have limitations means that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.220" end="00:26:30.899" style="s2">plot of your life is the overcoming of<br />those limitations and that if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.899" end="00:26:35.289" style="s2">have limitations well there wouldn&#39;t be<br />a plot and maybe there would be no life</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.289" end="00:26:39.500" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of the reason why<br />perhaps you have to accept the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.500" end="00:26:43.570" style="s2">you&#39;re flawed and insufficient and and<br />live with it and consider it a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.570" end="00:26:49.539" style="s2">precondition for being it&#39;s at least a<br />reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.539" end="00:26:55.419" style="s2">it&#39;s a reasonable idea so anyways one of<br />the main characters is the country the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.419" end="00:26:59.730" style="s2">known the explored territory we went<br />over that a bit and it always has two</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.730" end="00:27:05.570" style="s2">elements I mean your country is your<br />greatest friend and your worst enemy you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.570" end="00:27:11.870" style="s2">know because it squashes you into<br />conformity and demands that you act in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.870" end="00:27:16.139" style="s2">certain manner and reduces your<br />individuality to that element that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.139" end="00:27:21.250" style="s2">tolerated by everyone else and it it<br />constrains your potential in a single</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.250" end="00:27:27.379" style="s2">direction and so it&#39;s really tyrannical<br />but at the same time it provides you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.379" end="00:27:33.850" style="s2">with a place to be and all of the<br />benefits that have accrued as a result</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:38.590" style="s2">of the actions of your ancestors and all<br />the other people that you&#39;re associated</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.590" end="00:27:45.240" style="s2">with so there&#39;s the good tyrant or the<br />bad tyrant and the good King and those</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.240" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">are archetypal figures and that&#39;s<br />because they&#39;re always true and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:52.700" style="s2">always true simultaneously you know<br />which is partly why I object to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.700" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">notion of the patriarchy because it&#39;s a<br />myth the law the it&#39;s the what do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:02.870" style="s2">call that it&#39;s the apprehension of a<br />mythological trope which is that of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.870" end="00:28:07.509" style="s2">evil tyrant without any appreciation for<br />the fact that the archetype actually has</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.509" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">two parts and the other part is the wise<br />king and you know you can tell an evil</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:17.240" style="s2">tyrant story about culture no problem<br />but it&#39;s one-sided and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.240" end="00:28:23.210" style="s2">dangerous because you don&#39;t want to<br />forget all the good things that you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.210" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">while you&#39;re criticizing all the ways<br />that things are in error that&#39;s a lack</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:32.270" style="s2">of gratitude and it&#39;s a lack of wisdom<br />and it&#39;s it&#39;s founded in resentment and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.270" end="00:28:40.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very dangerous both personally<br />and socially I told you that Captain</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.010" end="00:28:44.330" style="s2">Hook is a tyrant because he&#39;s got this<br />crocodile chasing him in the crocodile</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.330" end="00:28:48.809" style="s2">has a clock in its stomach and that&#39;s<br />death it&#39;s like obviously right tick</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.809" end="00:28:53.249" style="s2">tick tick tick and it&#39;s a crocodile and<br />it&#39;s under the water and it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.249" end="00:28:57.799" style="s2">got a taste of him so he&#39;s being chased<br />around by death and that makes him</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.799" end="00:29:02.570" style="s2">terrified and resentful and and cruel<br />and bitter</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.570" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">so he&#39;s a tyrant and he wants to wreak<br />havoc everywhere and then Peter Pan of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">course looks at Captain Hook and thinks<br />why the hell should I grow up and to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:17.940" style="s2">a tyrant and sacrifice all the potential<br />of childhood and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.940" end="00:29:22.390" style="s2">the potential sacrifices itself if you<br />don&#39;t utilize it as you mature and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.390" end="00:29:28.090" style="s2">just end up a 40 year old lost boy which<br />is a horrifying thing to behold it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.090" end="00:29:31.929" style="s2">almost as if you&#39;re the corpse of a<br />child the living corpse of a child</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.929" end="00:29:35.970" style="s2">because who the hell wants a<br />six-year-old 40 year old you&#39;re a little</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.970" end="00:29:41.850" style="s2">on the stale side by that point and not<br />the world&#39;s happiest individual so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.850" end="00:29:45.470" style="s2">know your potential is going to<br />disappear because you aged anyways and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.470" end="00:29:50.269" style="s2">so you might as well shape that<br />potential in a particular direction and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.269" end="00:30:00.909" style="s2">at least become something no matter how<br />limited rather than nothing so you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.909" end="00:30:08.679" style="s2">Peter Pan that&#39;s a great story it&#39;s a<br />great mythological story so well so</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.679" end="00:30:13.519" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about tyrants well not only<br />are they mythological figures but they</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.519" end="00:30:18.990" style="s2">exist and they tend to be deified I mean<br />Stalin was for all intents and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.990" end="00:30:23.950" style="s2">God the Father in Soviet Russia although<br />he was pretty much only the worst</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.950" end="00:30:29.100" style="s2">elements of Old Testament God who was<br />you know constantly smiting people and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.100" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">and wiping out populations and doing all<br />sorts of things that seem to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">nasty but nonetheless you know people<br />worshipped him in many ways and and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:43.970" style="s2">a representation of just exactly what<br />goes wrong when things really go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.970" end="00:30:47.299" style="s2">when people stop paying attention and<br />when they all lie because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.299" end="00:30:52.629" style="s2">things that characterized the communist<br />state was that no one ever got to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.629" end="00:30:58.249" style="s2">anything they actually believed ever and<br />that was partly because one out of three</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.249" end="00:31:02.039" style="s2">people was an informer which meant if<br />you had a family of six people two of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.039" end="00:31:05.340" style="s2">them were informing on the government<br />about you and that included your own</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.340" end="00:31:10.639" style="s2">children and you and if you were an<br />informer you were often amply rewarded</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.639" end="00:31:14.360" style="s2">by the state so that if you lived in an<br />overcrowded apartment building with</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.360" end="00:31:18.860" style="s2">three families in the same<br />flat and you informed on you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.860" end="00:31:22.970" style="s2">woman down the hall that you didn&#39;t like<br />she got shift shipped off to the old</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.970" end="00:31:26.909" style="s2">concentration camp and you got her<br />apartment and so that was a lovely</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.909" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">society and it only killed about thirty<br />million people between 1919 and nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:37.000" style="s2">fifty-nine so that&#39;s what happens when<br />the archetypal structure gets tilted</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.000" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">badly when people forget that they have<br />a responsibility to fulfill as citizens</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:48.030" style="s2">as awake citizens who are capable of<br />stating the truth and the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.030" end="00:31:53.619" style="s2">shift so there&#39;s nothing left of the<br />Great Father except the tyrant and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.619" end="00:31:57.879" style="s2">not have that happen I mean the one on<br />the right is really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.879" end="00:32:03.619" style="s2">consciously or unconsciously you know<br />there&#39;s Stalin surrounded by what is for</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.619" end="00:32:09.539" style="s2">all intents and purposes fire you know<br />he looks like he looks like Maleficent</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.539" end="00:32:13.580" style="s2">in Sleeping Beauty when she shows up at<br />Aurora&#39;s christening you know she puts</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.580" end="00:32:22.909" style="s2">her arms up in the air and green fire<br />surrounds her it&#39;s like it&#39;s like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.909" end="00:32:26.909" style="s2">surrounded by fire and there&#39;s Lenin<br />above him who&#39;s like king of the fiery</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.909" end="00:32:30.840" style="s2">realm and that&#39;s for sure<br />so I mean all the terrors that happened</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.840" end="00:32:35.220" style="s2">in the Soviet Union didn&#39;t start under<br />stell and they started under Lenin and</p>

<p begin="00:32:41.419" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">way so you know this is another example<br />of the tyrannical element of the Great</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:55.480" style="s2">Father and the sorts of things that can<br />happen I mean I kind of got a an evil</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.480" end="00:33:00.289" style="s2">kick out of this bad that was quite old<br />you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.289" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">it&#39;s kitschy in some sense and and you<br />know it shows I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:06.169" style="s2">something you&#39;d ever see at a magazine<br />today</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.169" end="00:33:14.929" style="s2">10 unusual stamps showing evil dictator<br />you know well fair enough I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.929" end="00:33:19.559" style="s2">what he was and that&#39;s the consequence<br />and that&#39;s just a tiny bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.559" end="00:33:24.980" style="s2">consequence because the Nazis wiped out<br />a very large number of people often</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.980" end="00:33:32.179" style="s2">using compassion as a as a as a<br />as a justification so when they went</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.179" end="00:33:39.769" style="s2">after the mentally ill and the<br />terminally ill and those who whose</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.769" end="00:33:44.210" style="s2">intelligence was compromised for<br />biological reasons and and those who</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.210" end="00:33:47.830" style="s2">were too old<br />they basically justified it by saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.830" end="00:33:52.700" style="s2">that the enforced euthanasia was<br />merciful and that you were actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.700" end="00:33:58.580" style="s2">being a good person by complying with<br />the requirements and so something to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.580" end="00:34:02.059" style="s2">think about<br />more mythological representations I like</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.059" end="00:34:06.460" style="s2">these quite a bit so there&#39;s their<br />Hitler as you know Knight of the faith</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.460" end="00:34:12.830" style="s2">essentially with I suppose that&#39;s a<br />recreation of the Christian holy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.830" end="00:34:18.100" style="s2">dove you know except it&#39;s an eagle which<br />is a bird of prey and and a prayer and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.100" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">uh what do you call those things a<br />scavenger right so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:28.020" style="s2">interesting but that&#39;s Hitler as night<br />of the of the blood roughly speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.020" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">there this is an allied war poster<br />essentially that assimilates the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:40.260" style="s2">to poisonous snakes and you know we<br />don&#39;t like poisonous snakes very much</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.260" end="00:34:44.230" style="s2">and and it&#39;s probably because they&#39;ve<br />been preying on us for approximately</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.230" end="00:34:51.600" style="s2">twenty million years because snakes and<br />primates humans in particular co-evolved</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.600" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">and so the snake is a representation of<br />that which lies outside the comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:06.010" style="s2">domain and that can be you know a snake<br />obviously or it can be an abstract snake</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.010" end="00:35:11.840" style="s2">and the abstract snake is your enemy or<br />an even more abstract snake is the evil</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.840" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">in your own heart and this is going to<br />be a bit of a leap for you but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:22.850" style="s2">this ancient idea that developed in what<br />in the West over thousands of years far</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.850" end="00:35:29.000" style="s2">predating Christianity that at least its<br />origins that the snake in the Garden of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.000" end="00:35:33.640" style="s2">Eden was also Satan which is like of<br />what the hell it&#39;s a very strange idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.640" end="00:35:38.950" style="s2">but the reason for that as far as I can<br />tell is that you know we have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.950" end="00:35:42.870" style="s2">circuitry that detects predators and a<br />predator</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.870" end="00:35:46.510" style="s2">representation of a predator is a snake<br />or a monster that incorporates</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.510" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">snake-like features like a dragon or<br />something like that or a dinosaur with</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:54.700" style="s2">lots of teeth or a shark that lives<br />under the water and will pull you down</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.700" end="00:35:58.300" style="s2">you know because I suspect a lot of our<br />ancestors met a nasty death at the hands</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.300" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">of Nile crocodiles while they were in<br />the African veldt going down to get some</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:07.390" style="s2">nice water so you know that&#39;s the thing<br />that jumps up and pulls you under and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.390" end="00:36:11.130" style="s2">you know that happens in your own life<br />because things jump up and pull you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.130" end="00:36:15.640" style="s2">under you know and use the same<br />circuitry we use the same circuitry to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.640" end="00:36:21.790" style="s2">process unknown things that upset us as<br />we once used to detect predators who</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.790" end="00:36:27.210" style="s2">were likely to invade our space and so<br />and and human beings are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.210" end="00:36:30.930" style="s2">abstraction and so you know you could<br />think about the real predator that might</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.930" end="00:36:35.240" style="s2">invade your space and maybe that&#39;s a<br />snake or a wolf or or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.240" end="00:36:40.500" style="s2">monster you know and that&#39;s pretty<br />concrete and biological chimps have that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.500" end="00:36:45.190" style="s2">you know chimps don&#39;t like snakes and so<br />if you a chimp comes across a snake in</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.190" end="00:36:50.310" style="s2">the wild then like a big let&#39;s say I<br />don&#39;t know what live with chimps I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.310" end="00:36:54.070" style="s2">know if they&#39;re pythons but they have<br />constrictors there anyways so you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.070" end="00:36:58.630" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s like a 20 foot constrictor<br />and this and the chimp like stays a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.630" end="00:37:02.900" style="s2">distance away from it but it won&#39;t leave<br />and then it has this particular cry that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.900" end="00:37:09.910" style="s2">it uh ters that&#39;s called a snake rah WRA<br />a and so it makes this noise which means</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.910" end="00:37:14.940" style="s2">something like holy shit that&#39;s a big<br />snake and I actually mean that because</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.940" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">the circuits that primates use to utter<br />distress calls are the same circuits</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:25.360" style="s2">that we use to curse just so you know<br />that&#39;s why people with Tourette&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.360" end="00:37:29.330" style="s2">syndrome swear because like what what&#39;s<br />up with that how can you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.330" end="00:37:34.220" style="s2">neurological condition that makes you<br />swear well it turns out that guttural</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.220" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">effect Laden curses are mediated by a<br />different speech circuit and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:45.830" style="s2">speech circuit we share with the<br />predator alarms of other primates so</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.830" end="00:37:51.560" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty cool so anyways this chimp<br />stands there and makes this snake noise</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.560" end="00:37:55.191" style="s2">and then all bunch of other chimps come<br />running and you know some of them stay a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.191" end="00:37:58.590" style="s2">fair ways from the snake<br />can some of them get pretty close but</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.590" end="00:38:03.700" style="s2">they&#39;ll stand there and watch that snake<br />for like 24 hours you know so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.700" end="00:38:06.850" style="s2">fascinated by it and you know if you&#39;ve<br />handled snakes you can understand that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.850" end="00:38:12.941" style="s2">fascination because they&#39;re fascinating<br />you know and they&#39;re numinous I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.941" end="00:38:17.020" style="s2">say that that&#39;s the right way of putting<br />it at numinous is a word that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.020" end="00:38:22.300" style="s2">intrinsically meaningful like a fire you<br />know you can&#39;t look away from fire you</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.300" end="00:38:25.290" style="s2">know if you&#39;re sitting in front of a<br />fireplace it&#39;s like you&#39;re staring at it</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.290" end="00:38:30.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s because you&#39;re all descended<br />from the first mad chimpanzee who had</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.050" end="00:38:35.880" style="s2">some weird genetic mutation that made it<br />impossible for him to stay away from</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.880" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">fire it was like the first chimp<br />arsonist you know and and he figured it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:45.540" style="s2">out and well hey now he was a chimp with<br />a stick with fire on it like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.540" end="00:38:53.840" style="s2">mega chimp man and so you know we have<br />that mutation in spades and no wonder so</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.840" end="00:39:01.970" style="s2">anyways so they they make this you know<br />they have this reaction to snakes and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.970" end="00:39:05.410" style="s2">chimps that have never seen a snake if<br />they&#39;re in a cage and you throw a rubber</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.410" end="00:39:10.110" style="s2">snake in there it&#39;s like bang they hit<br />the roof but then they look at the snake</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.110" end="00:39:14.100" style="s2">you know it&#39;s so it&#39;s like it&#39;s<br />terrifying and fascinating at the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.100" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">time and you should look at the snake<br />because you want to know what it does</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:20.910" style="s2">but you should stay away from it because<br />it&#39;s a snake so you you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.910" end="00:39:25.430" style="s2">screwed in terms of your motivations<br />right one is get the hell away and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.430" end="00:39:30.590" style="s2">other is well don&#39;t don&#39;t let that thing<br />do anything that you&#39;re not watching and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.590" end="00:39:36.380" style="s2">so that&#39;s really the reaction we have to<br />the unknown it&#39;s terrifying but we watch</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.380" end="00:39:41.070" style="s2">it and then you know the meta story is<br />that not only do we watch it but we go</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.070" end="00:39:45.510" style="s2">explore it and so you might think well<br />back in the Garden of Eden so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.510" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">when we were living in trees the snakes<br />used to come and eat us and and our</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:56.350" style="s2">offspring more likely and you know we<br />weren&#39;t very happy about that and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.350" end="00:40:00.670" style="s2">we figured out how to maybe maybe by<br />accident draw up a stay a stick on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.670" end="00:40:04.910" style="s2">snake and that was a good thing because<br />the snake didn&#39;t like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.910" end="00:40:09.430" style="s2">maybe the next thing we learned a little<br />later was to like actually take a stick</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.430" end="00:40:11.930" style="s2">and like<br />ock the snake with it and you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.930" end="00:40:16.970" style="s2">believe that the first primate who<br />figured out that was just as popular as</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.970" end="00:40:21.270" style="s2">the guy who mastered fire and so we&#39;re<br />pretty good at whacking state snakes</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.270" end="00:40:25.990" style="s2">with sticks which is why Springfield has<br />a snake</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.990" end="00:40:30.521" style="s2">whacking day it&#39;s devoted to nothing but<br />that right I don&#39;t know if you know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.521" end="00:40:35.870" style="s2">Simpsons episode but it&#39;s quite comical<br />so well so then you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.870" end="00:40:40.730" style="s2">snake as a predator and it&#39;s the thing<br />that invades the garden always because</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.730" end="00:40:43.940" style="s2">you just can&#39;t keep snakes out of the<br />damn garden no matter how hard you try</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.940" end="00:40:48.510" style="s2">and then you think of snakes and maybe<br />you think of meta snakes and like a meta</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.510" end="00:40:54.980" style="s2">snake would be also a predator but maybe<br />that&#39;s the predator that represents the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.980" end="00:40:59.250" style="s2">the destructive spirit of the other<br />tribe because chimpanzees for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.250" end="00:41:03.870" style="s2">are quite tribal and they definitely go<br />to war with one another and so you think</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.870" end="00:41:09.090" style="s2">you abstract out the idea of the<br />predator to represent malevolence as</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.090" end="00:41:14.600" style="s2">such and then you take that one step<br />further and you realize that the worst</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.600" end="00:41:22.680" style="s2">of all evil predators is the human<br />capacity for evil and then at that point</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.680" end="00:41:27.390" style="s2">you know you&#39;re starting to I would say<br />psychologize or spiritual eyes the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.390" end="00:41:33.120" style="s2">of danger and making it make it into<br />something that&#39;s conceptual and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.120" end="00:41:38.100" style="s2">something that&#39;s psychological and<br />something that you can you can face sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.100" end="00:41:41.990" style="s2">of on mas I mean one of the things<br />people had to figure out was how do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.990" end="00:41:47.150" style="s2">deal with danger and so you feel figure<br />out how you deal with a specific danger</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.150" end="00:41:51.100" style="s2">but then because human beings are death<br />so damn smart they thought well what if</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.100" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">we considered the class of all dangerous<br />things and then what have we considered</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:01.920" style="s2">a a mode of being that was the best mode<br />of being in the face of the class of all</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.920" end="00:42:06.140" style="s2">dangerous things well that&#39;s a lot<br />better you get you know you could solve</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.140" end="00:42:10.310" style="s2">all the dangerous problems all at once<br />instead of having to conjure up a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.310" end="00:42:14.281" style="s2">different solution for every dangerous<br />thing and that&#39;s basically as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.281" end="00:42:19.110" style="s2">can tell where the hero&#39;s story came<br />from and the hero&#39;s story is basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.110" end="00:42:23.610" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a community it&#39;s<br />threatened by the emergence of some old</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.610" end="00:42:26.620" style="s2">evil<br />often represented by a dragon that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.620" end="00:42:32.770" style="s2">sort of typical say of the Lord of the<br />Rings stories there&#39;s a hero often a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.770" end="00:42:37.010" style="s2">humble guy but not always sometimes a<br />knight decides he&#39;ll go out there you</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.010" end="00:42:42.040" style="s2">know and chase down the snake maybe even<br />or the serpent or the dragon maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.040" end="00:42:46.190" style="s2">in its lair and he&#39;ll have a bunch of<br />adventures on the way that transform him</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.190" end="00:42:53.930" style="s2">from you know useless naive Hobbit into<br />you know sword wielding hero and he</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.930" end="00:42:57.510" style="s2">confronts the dragon and gets the gold<br />and frees the people that it had</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.510" end="00:43:03.750" style="s2">enslaved and then comes back transformed<br />to share what he&#39;s learned with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.750" end="00:43:07.670" style="s2">community it&#39;s like well that&#39;s the<br />human story fundamentally and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.670" end="00:43:10.950" style="s2">that&#39;s our basic instinctive pattern and<br />it&#39;s represented in narratives</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.950" end="00:43:15.620" style="s2">constantly and that&#39;s partly what this<br />see this has meaning you know what this</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.620" end="00:43:20.060" style="s2">means<br />why why do you know well you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.060" end="00:43:23.130" style="s2">because it draws on symbolic<br />representations that you already</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.130" end="00:43:29.850" style="s2">understand you understand that a mess of<br />tooth snakes is not a good thing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.850" end="00:43:37.270" style="s2">that may be the sensible thing to do is<br />stomp them and it&#39;s not like you need an</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.270" end="00:43:42.030" style="s2">instruction manual to figure out what<br />the poster means and so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.030" end="00:43:45.300" style="s2">two different representations of Hitler<br />that&#39;s sort of the pro-hitler</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.300" end="00:43:49.820" style="s2">representation and I would say that&#39;s<br />the anti-hitler representation and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.820" end="00:43:53.100" style="s2">know that&#39;s the real Hitler who at this<br />point does not look like a very happy</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.100" end="00:44:00.080" style="s2">clam so so that&#39;s the known that&#39;s<br />culture that&#39;s order and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.080" end="00:44:06.820" style="s2">eternally juxtaposed to culture and the<br />known and the explored and order is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.820" end="00:44:13.020" style="s2">unknown and the unknown is a strange<br />place the unknown is actually it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.020" end="00:44:17.560" style="s2">physical place like the unknown is the<br />place that when you&#39;re camping and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.560" end="00:44:22.060" style="s2">you&#39;re around a fire the unknown is<br />everything outside the circle of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.060" end="00:44:28.470" style="s2">light and you remember in the Lion King<br />you may not remember when when when</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.470" end="00:44:34.230" style="s2">Mufasa that&#39;s the king right goes and<br />takes Simba up to show him his territory</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.230" end="00:44:38.680" style="s2">he says he is the king of everything<br />that the light touches</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.680" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very old idea and you guys<br />had no problem with you know that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:46.430" style="s2">fine that made sense and that I would be<br />on the light was the darkness and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.430" end="00:44:50.410" style="s2">was the elephant graveyard that was<br />death that was the place of death and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.410" end="00:44:54.290" style="s2">danger that&#39;s where the hyenas hung out<br />and you weren&#39;t supposed to go there and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.290" end="00:44:58.060" style="s2">so of course Simba because he&#39;s a rule<br />breaking hero just like Harry Potter</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.060" end="00:45:02.890" style="s2">immediately goes there and so you know<br />that&#39;s like the forbidden fruit it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.890" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">same sort of idea if you want someone to<br />do something the best thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:14.230" style="s2">tell them that they shouldn&#39;t and not<br />explain why you know so for example if I</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.230" end="00:45:20.470" style="s2">said to you at the beginning of this<br />class look I&#39;ve got one rule here don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.470" end="00:45:25.540" style="s2">sit in that chair no matter what you&#39;d<br />be thinking the whole year especially if</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.540" end="00:45:29.980" style="s2">I reminded you well just what&#39;s up with<br />that chair like let&#39;s chair as magical</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.980" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">all of a sudden you some of you might<br />even well you probably wouldn&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:37.390" style="s2">this is a ridiculous example but maybe<br />you know you come to class early and sit</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.390" end="00:45:41.100" style="s2">in that chair just to see what would<br />happen you know and people are very</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.100" end="00:45:45.190" style="s2">curious and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re<br />like and that&#39;s a very old story too</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.190" end="00:45:49.510" style="s2">right it&#39;s like opening Pandora&#39;s box<br />don&#39;t open that box you&#39;ll be sorry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.510" end="00:45:55.130" style="s2">like oh huh you know all the horrors of<br />the world fly out and believe me you</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.130" end="00:46:00.350" style="s2">will open Pandora&#39;s box many times in<br />your life because you know with your</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.350" end="00:46:06.380" style="s2">family or maybe your mate or maybe your<br />children you&#39;ll have this idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.380" end="00:46:11.060" style="s2">have a box with things in it that you<br />want to know about and you&#39;ll say well</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.060" end="00:46:15.130" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of curious about this<br />particular event so why don&#39;t you tell</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.130" end="00:46:19.100" style="s2">me about it and they say well no we<br />probably really shouldn&#39;t open that box</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.100" end="00:46:23.150" style="s2">and you keep bugging them and then they<br />open it and then all sorts of things fly</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.150" end="00:46:26.510" style="s2">out that you didn&#39;t expect and then<br />maybe you think hey it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.510" end="00:46:31.000" style="s2">better if I would have just left that<br />damn box closed but and you can do the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.000" end="00:46:35.550" style="s2">same thing to yourself believe me<br />and so the Pandora&#39;s box idea the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.550" end="00:46:40.420" style="s2">forbidden fruit idea that&#39;s that&#39;s a<br />major-league idea and part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.420" end="00:46:44.290" style="s2">in the judeo-christian tradition why<br />people are saddled with the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.290" end="00:46:51.340" style="s2">original sin is because hyper cortically<br />developed chimpanzees without much sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.340" end="00:46:55.010" style="s2">can<br />keep their hands off things and so they</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.010" end="00:47:00.490" style="s2">keep exploring even when they know<br />better and every time they do that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.490" end="00:47:07.790" style="s2">learn something that is that destroys<br />the paradise that they currently inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.790" end="00:47:11.310" style="s2">right because there&#39;s plenty Unni and I<br />never learned anything in your life</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.310" end="00:47:16.890" style="s2">that&#39;s of importance without it having a<br />pretty damn destabilizing effect on you</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.890" end="00:47:23.090" style="s2">at the moment of realisation right you<br />learn something happy it&#39;s like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.090" end="00:47:26.370" style="s2">you know that all that means is that I<br />was doing things right like it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.370" end="00:47:32.610" style="s2">and everything but it&#39;s not informative<br />you do something and all hell breaks</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.610" end="00:47:38.270" style="s2">loose that&#39;ll make you think that&#39;s for<br />sure you might never stop thinking for</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.270" end="00:47:44.840" style="s2">the rest of your life so anyways the<br />unknown the unknown is that which</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.840" end="00:47:49.780" style="s2">surrounds the known it&#39;s an unexplored<br />territory it&#39;s usually represented as</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.780" end="00:47:54.870" style="s2">female I think for a variety of reasons<br />and not not as female exactly it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.870" end="00:47:58.091" style="s2">the right way to think about it as<br />feminine and that&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.091" end="00:48:03.850" style="s2">because feminine is a symbolic category<br />whereas female is like an actual female</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.850" end="00:48:08.631" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t want to confuse the<br />metaphor with with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.631" end="00:48:14.350" style="s2">actuality because we have these social<br />cognitive categories built-in you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.350" end="00:48:19.170" style="s2">you might say masculine feminine and<br />offspring something like that we had to</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.170" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">use what we could to represent what we<br />were attempting to figure out and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:30.360" style="s2">kind of mapped them onto the external<br />realities of being the best we could</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.360" end="00:48:35.800" style="s2">using what we could and so you know<br />nature is benevolent and it&#39;s fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.800" end="00:48:40.500" style="s2">you know all things come from nature and<br />all things come from the unknown right</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.500" end="00:48:46.300" style="s2">because the known is already there it&#39;s<br />the unknown that manifests the new right</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.300" end="00:48:51.050" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of the reason for the<br />characterization of the unknown as</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.050" end="00:48:57.070" style="s2">feminine and then there&#39;s also the case<br />that women play a massive role in sexual</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.070" end="00:49:02.900" style="s2">selection among human beings so that mmm<br />from an evolutionary perspective you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.900" end="00:49:05.331" style="s2">twice as likely to be a failure if<br />you&#39;re a man then you</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.331" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">or if you&#39;re a woman in that you have<br />twice as many female ancestors as male</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:14.390" style="s2">ancestors and you think well that&#39;s<br />impossible but it&#39;s not all you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.390" end="00:49:20.220" style="s2">do is imagine that every woman has one<br />child half the men have two and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.220" end="00:49:25.900" style="s2">other half have zero and so end of<br />problem and that&#39;s basically how it</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.900" end="00:49:31.380" style="s2">works out so women are more choosy<br />mater&#39;s than men by a substantial margin</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.380" end="00:49:37.300" style="s2">there was a funny study done by the guy<br />who established it&#39;s one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.300" end="00:49:46.770" style="s2">dating sites and he looked at how women<br />rated men and they rated the 50th</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.770" end="00:49:52.430" style="s2">percentile man at the 15th percentile so<br />85% of men were below average according</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.430" end="00:49:57.430" style="s2">to women&#39;s ratings now men had their<br />same arbitrary choices because of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.430" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">they preferred younger women to older<br />women and and they were more swayed I</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:07.880" style="s2">would say by by attractiveness but that<br />didn&#39;t have set nearly as big an effect</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.880" end="00:50:15.061" style="s2">on their actually actually writing of<br />women so anyway so you know from from a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.061" end="00:50:22.410" style="s2">Darwinian perspective nature is that<br />which selects so that&#39;s all it is and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.410" end="00:50:27.070" style="s2">sexual selection plays a massive role in<br />human evolution you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.070" end="00:50:31.080" style="s2">we have these massive brains is very<br />likely a consequence of a positive</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.080" end="00:50:35.320" style="s2">feedback loop and sexual selection<br />you know because otherwise that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.320" end="00:50:40.320" style="s2">only time you can get really rapid<br />changes in evolutionary space where you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.320" end="00:50:44.890" style="s2">know you get a process going that<br />reinforces itself so there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.890" end="00:50:48.800" style="s2">preference for intelligence and then<br />that produces more intelligent men and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.800" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">women and then there&#39;s a little more<br />preference for intelligence and you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:56.890" style="s2">maybe then that turns into the ability<br />to speak and or to master fire and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.890" end="00:51:00.940" style="s2">there&#39;s way more selection for<br />intelligence and the brain just goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.940" end="00:51:06.180" style="s2">like this you know and women have paid a<br />pretty big price for that because your</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.180" end="00:51:10.860" style="s2">hips are basically so wide that you can<br />barely run and if they were any wider</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.860" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">than you couldn&#39;t and of course the<br />pelvic passageway through which the baby</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:20.810" style="s2">travels is too small so it&#39;s<br />really painful and dangerous and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.810" end="00:51:26.350" style="s2">baby&#39;s head has to compress quite a lot<br />I mean they come out cone-shaped often</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.350" end="00:51:30.700" style="s2">and then they&#39;re born really young so<br />you have to take care of them forever</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.700" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">like what the hell you know a deer is<br />born a fawn is born and it&#39;s like two</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:38.290" style="s2">seconds later it&#39;s standing and then<br />it&#39;s running from a lion it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.290" end="00:51:44.980" style="s2">know it&#39;s like 15 minutes later and a<br />baby it&#39;s like you just lies there and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.980" end="00:51:49.830" style="s2">you know utters plaintive noises that&#39;s<br />all it can do and that does that for</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:56.220" style="s2">like ten months before it could skitter<br />away from a sloth if it was predatory</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.220" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">you know so you really got to take care<br />of those creatures and so that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:06.440" style="s2">price to pay that&#39;s a big price to pay<br />for our cortical evolution so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.440" end="00:52:12.560" style="s2">here is some of the symbolic represents<br />representatives of the unknown the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.560" end="00:52:17.490" style="s2">unconscious Dionysian force of the it&#39;d<br />that sort of Freud&#39;s representation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.490" end="00:52:23.130" style="s2">the unknown the terrors of the darkness<br />that&#39;s the unknown the monsters that</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.130" end="00:52:28.510" style="s2">lurk they&#39;re the source and the resting<br />place of all things the great mother the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.510" end="00:52:32.020" style="s2">Queen the matrix which means matter<br />which means mother</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.020" end="00:52:37.320" style="s2">the matriarch matter mother the<br />container the cornucopia the object to</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:46.870" style="s2">the pregnant the strange the emotional<br />the foreigner the place of return and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.870" end="00:52:51.940" style="s2">rest the deep the valley the cleft the<br />cave hell death and the grave because</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.940" end="00:52:57.570" style="s2">it&#39;s beyond the moon ruler of the night<br />and mysterious dark and matter and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.570" end="00:53:03.140" style="s2">earth then you know all this because<br />when you watch a movie that&#39;s rife with</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.140" end="00:53:07.480" style="s2">symbolic representations it draws on<br />those underlying metaphors and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.480" end="00:53:11.720" style="s2">natural I mean where does a witch live<br />well in a swamp for God&#39;s sake she</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.720" end="00:53:16.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t live in the penthouse of a New<br />York Tower she lives in a swamp and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.060" end="00:53:20.090" style="s2">dark there and if the moon&#39;s up that&#39;s a<br />better and maybe it could be a crescent</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.090" end="00:53:23.970" style="s2">moon or maybe it could be a full moon<br />but you know witches live in the right</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.970" end="00:53:28.190" style="s2">place if you&#39;re going to understand it<br />and you all you understand all of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.190" end="00:53:33.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s part of the structure of your<br />imagination you could say</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.430" end="00:53:40.510" style="s2">and so it&#39;s part of the unspoken<br />fantastical imagination that unites all</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.510" end="00:53:45.940" style="s2">of us and it makes us specifically human<br />there&#39;s a good representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.940" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">underworld and the place of<br />transformation so that&#39;s Hell in Isis in</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:54.990" style="s2">Egypt was queen of the underworld and<br />the underworld generally has a queen and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.990" end="00:54:01.160" style="s2">she usually shows up when order falls<br />apart and so you go to the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.160" end="00:54:05.240" style="s2">when your life falls apart that&#39;s what<br />it means and so when you see these</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.240" end="00:54:13.580" style="s2">stories of the hero you know journeying<br />to unknown lands of terror and danger</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.580" end="00:54:16.890" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what happens to you it<br />happens to you all the time you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.890" end="00:54:22.520" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re in this little safe space<br />like The Hobbit in the Shire and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.520" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a great evil brewing<br />somewhere and you can no longer ignore</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:31.750" style="s2">it so off you go into the land of terror<br />and uncertainty and better to go on</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.750" end="00:54:35.810" style="s2">purpose then accidentally that&#39;s for<br />sure because at least you can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.810" end="00:54:41.310" style="s2">prepared and we also know that if you&#39;re<br />going to face a threat if you face it</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.310" end="00:54:45.700" style="s2">voluntarily what happens is your body<br />activates itself for exploration and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.700" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">mastery but if you face it involuntarily<br />same size threat then you you you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:57.940" style="s2">revert to pray pray mode and you&#39;re<br />frozen and that&#39;s way way way more</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.940" end="00:55:03.690" style="s2">stressful it&#39;s way harder on your body<br />and so it&#39;s better to keep your eye open</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.690" end="00:55:07.190" style="s2">and watch for emergent threats because<br />you all know you know what you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.190" end="00:55:10.930" style="s2">doing quite right and where your life is<br />likely to unravel you all have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.930" end="00:55:16.120" style="s2">of that and the best thing to do is to<br />not ignore that to pay attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.120" end="00:55:21.880" style="s2">to watch it and to take corrective<br />action early and then you know you stay</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.880" end="00:55:26.040" style="s2">on top of things and things your little<br />trip to the underworld might be a few</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.040" end="00:55:30.120" style="s2">minutes long instead of a catastrophe<br />that produces post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.120" end="00:55:35.820" style="s2">disorder knocks you out for four or five<br />years and maybe you never recover so and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.820" end="00:55:39.020" style="s2">that&#39;s right you know that&#39;s what these<br />kind of symbolic representations mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.020" end="00:55:46.130" style="s2">it&#39;s those are states of being that that<br />that indicate being devoured and you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.130" end="00:55:49.050" style="s2">be devoured<br />your own unconscious Jesus that happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.050" end="00:55:54.180" style="s2">all the time what does that mean well<br />you know and it&#39;s an autonomous thing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.180" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">some sense you know like if you if you<br />get depressed or if you get really</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:02.650" style="s2">anxious you don&#39;t have any control over<br />that it&#39;s like it sweeps up over you and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.650" end="00:56:08.670" style="s2">pulls you down why down well down is<br />where you go when you&#39;re sad you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.670" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">go up man I&#39;m up today oh that&#39;s too bad<br />no it&#39;s man I&#39;m down today and well</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:18.890" style="s2">that&#39;s partly this and it&#39;s partly<br />because this is subordinate and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.890" end="00:56:24.730" style="s2">partly because down is closer to the<br />ground and farther from the sky like</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.730" end="00:56:29.540" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of reasons you&#39;re<br />feeling down rather than up up is where</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.540" end="00:56:34.730" style="s2">you&#39;re aiming right yeh MUP you don&#39;t<br />aim down well there the reason those</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.730" end="00:56:38.630" style="s2">phrases make sense is because they&#39;re<br />locked deeply into this underlying</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.630" end="00:56:44.020" style="s2">structure of imagination and well those<br />are the architect or the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.020" end="00:56:52.530" style="s2">structures according to Jung and I I<br />think that he&#39;s far as I can tell he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.530" end="00:56:58.300" style="s2">dead accurate and I think we understand<br />the biology of such things much better</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.300" end="00:57:02.420" style="s2">than we did so there is more<br />representations she&#39;s she&#39;s quite the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.420" end="00:57:07.490" style="s2">friendly creature that&#39;s Kelly<br />I like this representation better those</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.490" end="00:57:12.590" style="s2">are heads by the way in hands so she<br />sort of represents well very complex</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.590" end="00:57:17.730" style="s2">things she represents death she<br />represents transformation in this I</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.730" end="00:57:20.910" style="s2">already like this representation I think<br />it&#39;s brilliant so imagine that what the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.910" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">people were doing who formulated these<br />representations what they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">do was to make a representation of the<br />domain of threat itself right so that</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:35.830" style="s2">they could deal with the idea that<br />because we can say threat well what is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.830" end="00:57:39.590" style="s2">that what the hell does that mean well<br />threat is the category of all</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.590" end="00:57:42.980" style="s2">threatening things and so then you can<br />think about threat and you can think</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.980" end="00:57:47.510" style="s2">about threat across all those individual<br />instances and maybe you can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.510" end="00:57:53.100" style="s2">how to deal with threat right how what&#39;s<br />the best way to be in the world so that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.100" end="00:57:58.030" style="s2">you most effectively deal with threat<br />well that&#39;s sort of like apart from how</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.030" end="00:58:00.700" style="s2">do you deal with pain that&#39;s sort of<br />like the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.700" end="00:58:05.300" style="s2">question of human beings you want to be<br />terrified No</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.300" end="00:58:09.130" style="s2">so you want to be in danger No so like<br />you better figure out how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.130" end="00:58:13.370" style="s2">threat so first of all you have to<br />conceptualize it so we&#39;ll take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.370" end="00:58:16.930" style="s2">this representation so that&#39;s Kelly<br />shear</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.930" end="00:58:22.270" style="s2">her hair is on fire well fire you know<br />that&#39;s that&#39;s a numinous phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.270" end="00:58:28.440" style="s2">dangerous but transformative she&#39;s<br />wearing a headdress of skulls she has a</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.440" end="00:58:33.290" style="s2">weapon in this hand and and she has a<br />tiger&#39;s tongue she often has a snake</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.290" end="00:58:39.110" style="s2">around her waist need none of these do<br />but she often does but in this case this</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.110" end="00:58:44.010" style="s2">then that&#39;s because you know it it&#39;s a<br />snake we&#39;ve already covered that well</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.010" end="00:58:47.430" style="s2">these things that look like snakes here<br />aren&#39;t you notice how her belly is</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.430" end="00:58:52.010" style="s2">concave well it&#39;s because she&#39;s just<br />given birth to this unfortunate person</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.010" end="00:58:56.950" style="s2">that she happens to be standing on and<br />she&#39;s eating him intestines first and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.950" end="00:59:01.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a fire ring which he is in and<br />then it&#39;s got skulls on the inside of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.020" end="00:59:05.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like what&#39;s that supposed to do<br />well partly it&#39;s supposed to represent</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.820" end="00:59:11.170" style="s2">that which terrifies you it&#39;s like yeah<br />fair enough man because I don&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.170" end="00:59:14.410" style="s2">you saw those things in there before I<br />explained them but someone who was</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.410" end="00:59:18.770" style="s2">familiar with that image would know what<br />it meant it&#39;s like some poor artist was</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.770" end="00:59:22.530" style="s2">sitting there thinking well how do I<br />represent destruction it&#39;s like bang</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.530" end="00:59:27.410" style="s2">whoa okay well put that down and then we<br />won&#39;t look at it again so and then what</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.410" end="00:59:33.220" style="s2">do you do with this you make sacrifices<br />to it and you think well that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.220" end="00:59:40.720" style="s2">primitive you know first of all well<br />that doesn&#39;t really exist well it does</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.720" end="00:59:44.820" style="s2">if it&#39;s an amalgam of threat symbols I<br />can tell you that it exists that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.820" end="00:59:51.500" style="s2">sure so it exists as an abstraction if<br />nothing else do you offer it sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.500" end="00:59:55.510" style="s2">well what the hell do you think you do<br />what are you doing in class why aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.510" end="00:59:59.810" style="s2">you like drinking vodka and snorting<br />cocaine you know because you could be</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.810" end="01:00:06.010" style="s2">doing that instead here you are<br />listening to me you know slaving away in</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.010" end="01:00:10.630" style="s2">university you&#39;re young it&#39;s like really<br />you&#39;ve got nothing better to do than sit</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.630" end="01:00:15.330" style="s2">there you know well what you&#39;re willing<br />to forego today</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.330" end="01:00:20.180" style="s2">pleasure for tomorrow&#39;s advantage and<br />that&#39;s what sacrifice is and human</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.180" end="01:00:25.260" style="s2">beings discovered that dramatically<br />first you know like we were we were apes</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.260" end="01:00:29.890" style="s2">for God&#39;s sake we didn&#39;t just leap up<br />and think oh we better save for tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.890" end="01:00:34.860" style="s2">you know we it took thousands of years<br />for that idea to emerge and it emerged</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.860" end="01:00:40.000" style="s2">in dramatic form and it was sort of like<br />well society is sort of like a god know</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.000" end="01:00:42.650" style="s2">what they weren&#39;t thinking this through<br />is like if you&#39;re gonna represent</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.650" end="01:00:47.910" style="s2">society well it&#39;s like this<br />masculine God that&#39;s always judging the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.910" end="01:00:51.870" style="s2">hell out of you that&#39;s everywhere all at<br />the same time it&#39;s like yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.870" end="01:00:55.620" style="s2">true absolutely and what do you have to<br />do with it well you have to give it what</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.620" end="01:01:01.690" style="s2">it wants why why do you have to give it<br />what it wants because it&#39;ll crush you if</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.690" end="01:01:06.520" style="s2">you don&#39;t and that&#39;s exactly right<br />and if you&#39;re lucky and you give it the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.520" end="01:01:12.090" style="s2">right sacrifice then it&#39;ll smile on you<br />and you get to have a good life and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.090" end="01:01:17.960" style="s2">was like that was the major discovery of<br />mankind man that was a killer discovery</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.960" end="01:01:23.620" style="s2">it was like the discovery of the future<br />you know we discovered the future as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.620" end="01:01:29.020" style="s2">place and it was a place that you could<br />bargain with you can bargain with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.020" end="01:01:34.800" style="s2">future wow that&#39;s just what an idea that<br />is you know it&#39;s it&#39;s so unlikely well</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.800" end="01:01:40.840" style="s2">how do you bargain with the future well<br />you give it what it wants and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.840" end="01:01:44.410" style="s2">some of that you maintain your social<br />relationship and you know you make</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.410" end="01:01:49.510" style="s2">yourself useful to other people and you<br />shape yourself so that you can cooperate</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.510" end="01:01:55.030" style="s2">with people and you you don&#39;t act<br />impulsively and maybe you squirrel</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.030" end="01:01:59.210" style="s2">something away for the next harvest even<br />if you&#39;re hungry and you know and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.210" end="01:02:04.680" style="s2">the future isn&#39;t hell and you make the<br />proper sacrifices and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.680" end="01:02:11.800" style="s2">sacrifice to Kelly then she turns into<br />her opposite and showers benevolence on</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.800" end="01:02:17.690" style="s2">you and that&#39;s Mother Nature right it&#39;s<br />like look out for Mother Nature man you</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.690" end="01:02:22.110" style="s2">know two weeks out in the bush right now<br />and you&#39;re dead and it&#39;s not pleasant</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.110" end="01:02:27.150" style="s2">and then if it&#39;s the spring you last<br />longer huh but the bugs eat you and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.150" end="01:02:32.260" style="s2">that&#39;s not very fun either<br />so nature you know it&#39;s bent on your</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.260" end="01:02:37.000" style="s2">destruction but if you treat it properly<br />and carefully and make the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.000" end="01:02:41.930" style="s2">sacrifices then maybe one of her trees<br />will offer you some fruit and that would</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.930" end="01:02:48.740" style="s2">be okay and so believe me lots of people<br />died trying to figure that out</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.740" end="01:02:53.410" style="s2">so here&#39;s another way of looking at it<br />so I said you know order and chaos known</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.410" end="01:02:58.360" style="s2">unknown explored territory unexplored<br />territory I love this this is the Taoist</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.360" end="01:03:04.180" style="s2">symbol it&#39;s a symbol of being and being<br />isn&#39;t reality as you would conceptualize</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.180" end="01:03:09.870" style="s2">it as a scientist it&#39;s more like reality<br />as it manifests itself to you as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.870" end="01:03:14.760" style="s2">living thing which is completely<br />different you know science extracts out</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.760" end="01:03:19.180" style="s2">all the subjectivity all it is there is<br />an array of our objective facts of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.180" end="01:03:22.970" style="s2">equivalent value and that&#39;s part of its<br />method but that&#39;s not the world in which</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.970" end="01:03:27.800" style="s2">you live the world in which you live is<br />full of motivation and emotion it&#39;s full</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.800" end="01:03:33.050" style="s2">of terror and pain and joy and<br />frustration and and other people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.050" end="01:03:38.290" style="s2">for sure and so that&#39;s the real world<br />and so well that&#39;s what this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.290" end="01:03:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the real world and what is it made<br />out of well it&#39;s made out of all those</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.400" end="01:03:49.060" style="s2">things you know that can get out of hand<br />you know because the explored territory</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.060" end="01:03:53.660" style="s2">and the known can get so damn tight that<br />it&#39;s nothing but a tyrant and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.660" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">all those things you don&#39;t know and<br />that&#39;s pretty exciting because you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:00.120" style="s2">you want to go find out some things you<br />don&#39;t know and that adds a lot of spice</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.120" end="01:04:04.370" style="s2">to life you want a little adventure you<br />don&#39;t want to go out with someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.370" end="01:04:08.030" style="s2">so predictable that you know everything<br />about them in a week you know unless</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.030" end="01:04:11.560" style="s2">you&#39;re hyper conservative you want to go<br />out with someone who&#39;s got they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.560" end="01:04:15.640" style="s2">little erratic like not too erratic<br />let&#39;s say they&#39;re a little dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.640" end="01:04:21.430" style="s2">perhaps not too dangerous but some of<br />that at least you want predictability</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.430" end="01:04:25.580" style="s2">with a bit of unpredictability in there<br />well that&#39;s exactly what this means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.580" end="01:04:29.870" style="s2">like that&#39;s predictability with a little<br />unpredictability in it and what that</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.870" end="01:04:34.130" style="s2">also means is that what you know can be<br />turned into what you don&#39;t know just</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.130" end="01:04:38.650" style="s2">like that and that&#39;s going to happen to<br />you lots of times in your life man when</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.650" end="01:04:42.660" style="s2">someone close to you dies suddenly it&#39;s<br />like poof</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.660" end="01:04:46.520" style="s2">order turns into chaos and now you&#39;re in<br />chaos and what the hell are you gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.520" end="01:04:51.080" style="s2">there and that&#39;s a good question<br />because you need to know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.080" end="01:04:55.390" style="s2">there cuz you&#39;re gonna be there and it<br />happens to you when your dreams fall</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.390" end="01:04:59.380" style="s2">apart you know I mean your dreams for<br />your life or you know when you discover</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.380" end="01:05:03.800" style="s2">something awful about yourself that you<br />didn&#39;t know or you know it flips on you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.800" end="01:05:08.410" style="s2">all the time and in small ways sometimes<br />you know you have a fight with a friend</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.410" end="01:05:13.610" style="s2">or in big ways that that wipe you out<br />for well indefinitely sometimes because</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.610" end="01:05:18.320" style="s2">you can fall into chaos and never get<br />out you know that&#39;s the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.320" end="01:05:22.370" style="s2">trapped in the belly of the beast it<br />isn&#39;t necessary that when you descend</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.370" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">into chaos that you learn something and<br />you get back out you could just be stuck</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:32.220" style="s2">there suffering until you die and that&#39;s<br />you know I wouldn&#39;t recommend that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.220" end="01:05:37.140" style="s2">know it&#39;s something to avoid but it<br />happens to people all the time all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.140" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">time you see them wandering around you<br />know shattered on the streets of Toronto</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:47.790" style="s2">you know they&#39;re done they&#39;re in chaos<br />and there&#39;s so much chaos around them</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.790" end="01:05:52.170" style="s2">that you won&#39;t even go near them the<br />chaos spreads like eight feet around</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.170" end="01:05:55.660" style="s2">them and so when you see someone like<br />that you&#39;re like well first we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.660" end="01:05:59.390" style="s2">going to look too closely and people<br />like that often don&#39;t like you to look</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.390" end="01:06:03.380" style="s2">at them because that also helps them<br />remember where they are and that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.380" end="01:06:07.500" style="s2">Pleasant thing and you&#39;re gonna just<br />stay away from that maybe you&#39;ll cross</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.500" end="01:06:11.670" style="s2">the street maybe you&#39;ll keep your head<br />down whatever you&#39;re not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.670" end="01:06:16.940" style="s2">near that chaos and no bloody wonder you<br />know and and you don&#39;t think about it</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.940" end="01:06:22.190" style="s2">much after you pass it because it&#39;s a<br />hell of a thing to think about and what</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.190" end="01:06:25.580" style="s2">are you gonna do about it anyway so you<br />don&#39;t know what to do about it you might</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.580" end="01:06:32.130" style="s2">just make it worse well so chaos you<br />know that&#39;s the other half of life and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.130" end="01:06:36.140" style="s2">it can turn into order sometimes better<br />order that&#39;s actually what you do when</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.140" end="01:06:40.601" style="s2">you explore right you explore you find<br />out something new not too new not to</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.601" end="01:06:47.620" style="s2">Pandora boxy you know you bite off as<br />much as you can chew but no more and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.620" end="01:06:51.370" style="s2">that rearranges the way you look at the<br />world but you&#39;re doing it voluntarily so</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.370" end="01:06:55.980" style="s2">you can kind of tolerate there the<br />recalibration and you strength</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.980" end="01:07:00.790" style="s2">and the order right because now you<br />become more competent and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.790" end="01:07:05.950" style="s2">that you&#39;re trying to live on the edge<br />between order and chaos and I and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.950" end="01:07:10.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a real place that&#39;s an actual<br />it&#39;s a meta place but it&#39;s more real</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.030" end="01:07:15.310" style="s2">than places because it&#39;s so old it&#39;s<br />such an old place it really exists and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.310" end="01:07:19.440" style="s2">your nervous system knows that it sees<br />the world this way in fact the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.440" end="01:07:23.950" style="s2">hemisphere is roughly specialized for<br />chaos and the left hemisphere is roughly</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.950" end="01:07:27.510" style="s2">specialized for order which is why the<br />left hemisphere tends to have the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.510" end="01:07:31.460" style="s2">linguistic elements and and why people<br />are right-handed and the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.460" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">hemisphere has a more diffuse structure<br />it&#39;s more associated with negative</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:39.140" style="s2">emotion and imagination and the two<br />communicate between each other through</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.140" end="01:07:42.890" style="s2">the corpus callosum and the right<br />hemisphere appears to update the less</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.890" end="01:07:49.060" style="s2">left hemisphere kind of slowly often in<br />dreams and so if you were hurt if your</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.060" end="01:07:53.750" style="s2">right hemisphere is hurt for example<br />back here in the parietal lobe then you</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.750" end="01:07:58.230" style="s2">lose the left part of your body you<br />can&#39;t move it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.230" end="01:08:02.690" style="s2">but you also lose the idea that you have<br />a left part of your body so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.690" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">blindness it&#39;s a blindness to the left<br />and so if someone comes along and says</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:11.800" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not moving your left arm<br />you&#39;re gonna say yeah well my arthritis</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.800" end="01:08:16.200" style="s2">is bothering me 2d have moved it for six<br />months MA my arthritis is bothering</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.200" end="01:08:22.359" style="s2">today or you know you don&#39;t move in your<br />left foot it&#39;s like well you know uh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.359" end="01:08:26.910" style="s2">too tired well what&#39;s happened is the<br />left hemisphere has a representation of</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.910" end="01:08:30.580" style="s2">the body and it&#39;s not being updated<br />because the part of the brain that would</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.580" end="01:08:35.750" style="s2">notice that the left is gone because of<br />a stroke it isn&#39;t there anymore and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.750" end="01:08:40.370" style="s2">the left already has a model and it&#39;s<br />not gonna change just it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.370" end="01:08:44.650" style="s2">change your model of yourself you know<br />have a tooth pulled what happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.650" end="01:08:49.160" style="s2">like your damn tongue is in that hole<br />for the next six months fiddling around</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.160" end="01:08:53.520" style="s2">constantly and that&#39;s because you&#39;re<br />rebuilding your neurological model of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.520" end="01:08:58.690" style="s2">your body it&#39;s like try it out with your<br />whole left side and see how well you do</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.690" end="01:09:03.290" style="s2">you know so this guy named Ramachandran<br />was experimenting with people like this</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.290" end="01:09:07.710" style="s2">and one of the things he did was kind of<br />he was checking their balance and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.710" end="01:09:12.460" style="s2">can do that by<br />irrigating the ear with cold water and</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.460" end="01:09:15.350" style="s2">that makes people go like this makes<br />their eyes move back and forth because</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.350" end="01:09:20.250" style="s2">it upsets the vestibular system and what<br />he found was that if he if he poured</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.250" end="01:09:24.609" style="s2">cold water in the left ear of someone<br />with right per aisle damage who had left</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.609" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">neglect that they&#39;d all of a sudden sort<br />of wake up catastrophic ly they&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:34.920" style="s2">terrible reaction to the fact that they<br />were paralyzed on the left and they</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.920" end="01:09:40.190" style="s2">would know that it had happened and cry<br />and you know amid all sorts of distress</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.190" end="01:09:44.460" style="s2">and no wonder<br />and then like 20 minutes later they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.460" end="01:09:52.430" style="s2">snap back into their damaged mode of<br />being and they would not deny because</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.430" end="01:09:56.650" style="s2">that isn&#39;t really what it is is that<br />they couldn&#39;t update the model they just</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.650" end="01:10:00.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the neurology for it anymore<br />so they were back to not noticing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.060" end="01:10:05.980" style="s2">it was gone and coming up with stories<br />about it and so well so that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.980" end="01:10:08.980" style="s2">example of how the right and left<br />hemispheres worked together and how</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.980" end="01:10:13.580" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of mapped onto this weirdly<br />enough so you know we&#39;re map were</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.580" end="01:10:19.270" style="s2">adapted to the meta reality and so what<br />that would be is we&#39;re adapted to that</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.270" end="01:10:25.190" style="s2">which remains constant across the<br />longest spans of time and that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.190" end="01:10:30.360" style="s2">same things that you see flitting around<br />you day to day those are just they just</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.360" end="01:10:34.770" style="s2">like clouds they&#39;re just evaporating you<br />know there&#39;s things underneath that that</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.770" end="01:10:38.770" style="s2">are more fundamental that are more<br />fundamental realities like the dominance</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.770" end="01:10:44.380" style="s2">hierarchy like the tribe like the danger<br />outside of society like the threat that</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.380" end="01:10:47.920" style="s2">other people pose to you and that you<br />pose to yourself</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.920" end="01:10:53.120" style="s2">those are eternal realities and we&#39;re<br />adapted to those that&#39;s our world and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.120" end="01:10:57.190" style="s2">that&#39;s why we express that in stories<br />and so then you might say well how do</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.190" end="01:11:01.101" style="s2">you adapt yourself to this world and the<br />answer to that isn&#39;t I believe this is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.101" end="01:11:08.900" style="s2">neurological answer I believe this that<br />your brain can tell you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.900" end="01:11:13.121" style="s2">optimally situated between chaos and<br />order and the way it tells you that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.121" end="01:11:20.220" style="s2">by producing the sense of engagement and<br />meaning so let&#39;s say there&#39;s a place in</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.220" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">the environment you should be okay what<br />should that place be</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.080" end="01:11:28.730" style="s2">well you don&#39;t want to be terrified out<br />of your skull like what good is that and</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.730" end="01:11:33.030" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t want to be so<br />comfortable that you might as well sleep</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.030" end="01:11:38.360" style="s2">you want to be somewhere where you know<br />you&#39;re kind of on firm ground here but</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.360" end="01:11:43.450" style="s2">over here you&#39;re kind of testing out new<br />territory and some of you who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.450" end="01:11:47.820" style="s2">exploratory and emotionally stable you<br />know you&#39;re gonna go pretty far out into</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.820" end="01:11:51.860" style="s2">the unexplored territory without<br />destabilizing yourself and other people</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.860" end="01:11:57.660" style="s2">are gonna just put a toe in the chaos<br />and you know that&#39;s neuroticism</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.660" end="01:12:01.270" style="s2">basically that&#39;s that your sensitivity<br />to threat that&#39;s calibrated differently</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.270" end="01:12:05.070" style="s2">in different people and more some people<br />are more exploratory than others that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.070" end="01:12:09.580" style="s2">kind of extraversion and openness<br />working together and and intelligence so</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.580" end="01:12:15.280" style="s2">some people are going to tolerate a<br />larger admixture of chaos in their order</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.280" end="01:12:20.820" style="s2">those are liberals by the way and I mean<br />that technically liberals are more</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.820" end="01:12:26.320" style="s2">interested in novel chaos and<br />conservatives are more interested in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:32.790" style="s2">stabilization of the structures that<br />already exist and who&#39;s right well it</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.790" end="01:12:35.990" style="s2">depends on the situation and that&#39;s why<br />conservatives and liberals have to talk</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.990" end="01:12:42.040" style="s2">to each other because one of them isn&#39;t<br />right and the other wrong sometimes the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.040" end="01:12:45.460" style="s2">conservatives are right and sometimes<br />the liberals are right because the</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.460" end="01:12:49.380" style="s2">environments go in like this you can&#39;t<br />predict the damn thing so that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.380" end="01:12:53.440" style="s2">have to communicate and that&#39;s what a<br />democracy does it allows people of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.440" end="01:12:57.740" style="s2">different temperamental types to<br />communicate and to calibrate the damn</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.740" end="01:13:02.860" style="s2">societies so anyways so let&#39;s say you&#39;re<br />optimally balanced between chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.860" end="01:13:09.020" style="s2">order so what does that mean well you&#39;re<br />stable enough but you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.020" end="01:13:14.770" style="s2">right because a little novelty heightens<br />your anxiety that wakes you up a bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.770" end="01:13:18.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the adventure part of it but it<br />also focuses the part of your brain that</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.440" end="01:13:22.650" style="s2">does exploratory activity and that&#39;s<br />actually associated with pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.650" end="01:13:27.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the dopamine circuit and so if<br />you&#39;re optimally balanced and you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.720" end="01:13:30.820" style="s2">that you know you&#39;re there when you&#39;re<br />listening to an interesting conversation</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.820" end="01:13:35.050" style="s2">or you&#39;re engaged in one it&#39;s a real<br />conversation you know you&#39;re saying some</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.050" end="01:13:37.570" style="s2">things you know and the other person is<br />saying some things they know</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.570" end="01:13:43.480" style="s2">but the both of what you know is<br />changing it&#39;s like wow that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.480" end="01:13:46.390" style="s2">interesting you&#39;ll have a conversation<br />like that forever or maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.390" end="01:13:50.070" style="s2">reading a book like that or you&#39;re<br />listening to a piece of music that</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.070" end="01:13:56.290" style="s2">models that because what music does is<br />provide you with predictable forms</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.290" end="01:13:59.670" style="s2">multi-level predictable forms that<br />transform</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.670" end="01:14:03.980" style="s2">just the right amount and so music is a<br />very representational art form it says</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.980" end="01:14:08.470" style="s2">this is what the universe is like you<br />know there&#39;s a dancing element to it</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.470" end="01:14:13.250" style="s2">repetitive and then cute little<br />variations that sort of surprise and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.250" end="01:14:18.270" style="s2">delight you and and you think wow that&#39;s<br />so cool and it doesn&#39;t matter how</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.270" end="01:14:23.700" style="s2">nihilistic you are you know music still<br />infuses you with a sense of meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.700" end="01:14:27.940" style="s2">that&#39;s because it models meaning that&#39;s<br />what it does that&#39;s why we love it and</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.940" end="01:14:31.950" style="s2">you know you can dance to it and that<br />sort of symbolizes you putting yourself</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.950" end="01:14:37.930" style="s2">in harmony with these multiple layers of<br />reality and positioning yourself</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.930" end="01:14:42.740" style="s2">properly and you like that too you know<br />you&#39;ll pay for it oh boy I get to go</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.740" end="01:14:46.330" style="s2">dancing you know oh boy I get to listen<br />to music it&#39;s like what the hell are you</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.330" end="01:14:50.960" style="s2">doing listening to music what good is<br />that well you think that&#39;s a stupid</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.960" end="01:14:54.060" style="s2">question I don&#39;t care about your dopey<br />criticism I&#39;m going to listen to some</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.060" end="01:14:58.870" style="s2">music right it did there&#39;s no rational<br />there&#39;s no rational argument against</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.870" end="01:15:04.900" style="s2">music it&#39;s like you just don&#39;t even<br />think about it you just walk away from</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.900" end="01:15:10.380" style="s2">someone who&#39;s stupid enough to ask that<br />question it&#39;s like some things are</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.380" end="01:15:19.980" style="s2">obvious<br />well why okay so that&#39;s pretty fun so</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.980" end="01:15:24.230" style="s2">what mediates between these two domains<br />well that&#39;s what consciousness does far</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.230" end="01:15:28.170" style="s2">as I can tell and that&#39;s sort of the<br />individual and that&#39;s the hero that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.170" end="01:15:32.340" style="s2">another way of thinking about it it&#39;s<br />the logos that&#39;s another way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.340" end="01:15:37.570" style="s2">about it it&#39;s the word that generates<br />order out of chaos at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.570" end="01:15:42.750" style="s2">time it&#39;s the consciousness that<br />interacting with the matter of the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.750" end="01:15:47.210" style="s2">produces being that&#39;s basically it<br />that&#39;s basically you for all intents and</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.210" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">purposes<br />how do you do that well the unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:57.850" style="s2">does it to some degree you know because<br />it&#39;s with our fantasy that we first meet</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.850" end="01:16:02.620" style="s2">the unknown right well look say you&#39;re<br />going out with a new person it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.620" end="01:16:06.850" style="s2">what do you do you project a fantasy on<br />them and then you fall in love with the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.850" end="01:16:11.690" style="s2">fantasy and aren&#39;t you stupid because<br />you&#39;re gonna find out that the match</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.690" end="01:16:17.290" style="s2">between your damn fantasy and the actual<br />person is tenuous at best and so young</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.290" end="01:16:23.900" style="s2">would call that a projection of either<br />the anima or the animus you know the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.900" end="01:16:27.060" style="s2">anima is what a man projects onto a<br />woman he finds desirable it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.060" end="01:16:30.520" style="s2">she&#39;s the perfect woman<br />it&#39;s like well how do you know that</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.520" end="01:16:35.550" style="s2">you&#39;ve like seen her for four seconds<br />you know but it grips you and the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.550" end="01:16:39.000" style="s2">thing happens in the opposite direction<br />and it&#39;s an action of instinct you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.000" end="01:16:42.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like you fall in love with the<br />image and but interestingly enough what</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.790" end="01:16:47.750" style="s2">you do in a relationship that works is<br />that you actually I think that what you</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.750" end="01:16:50.771" style="s2">see<br />it&#39;s a rough approximation when you</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.771" end="01:16:56.650" style="s2">project the ideal and fall in love with<br />it you see what could be it could be</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.650" end="01:17:00.980" style="s2">that but it&#39;s going to take you a hell<br />of a lot of work because like you got no</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.980" end="01:17:05.500" style="s2">shortage of flaws and the other person<br />has no shortage of flaws and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.500" end="01:17:09.980" style="s2">bringing your flaws together and that&#39;s<br />going to produce a lot of friction and</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.980" end="01:17:14.960" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to engage in a lot of<br />dialogue before you approach that level</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.960" end="01:17:21.590" style="s2">of perfection again but maybe you can do<br />it then you get to live happily ever</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.590" end="01:17:25.400" style="s2">after<br />well would not be nice well so the</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.400" end="01:17:29.730" style="s2">unconscious meets the unknown and it it<br />meets it with imagination and fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.730" end="01:17:35.780" style="s2">and dream and art that&#39;s how you take so<br />you don&#39;t just go from what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.780" end="01:17:40.730" style="s2">know to fully articulated knowledge in<br />one bloody leap you can&#39;t do that you</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.730" end="01:17:46.400" style="s2">have to extend pseudo pods of fantasy<br />and imagination into the unknown that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.400" end="01:17:50.230" style="s2">kind of what theorizing is like right<br />even scientifically you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.230" end="01:17:53.280" style="s2">know something scientifically you<br />generate a theory well it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.280" end="01:17:58.590" style="s2">imaginative representation that your<br />unconscious is helping you generate and</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.590" end="01:18:02.460" style="s2">so you meet the unknown with fantasy<br />that&#39;s what the unconscious is for from</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.460" end="01:18:04.870" style="s2">the psychoanalytic perspective that&#39;s<br />what</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.870" end="01:18:09.960" style="s2">rheems do and you can see why you dream<br />about the future you know it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.960" end="01:18:13.160" style="s2">what&#39;s the future gonna be like well you<br />have a little imaginative story going on</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.160" end="01:18:17.660" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you don&#39;t really create it<br />it&#39;s sort of you watch it unfold you</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.660" end="01:18:21.720" style="s2">know maybe you could tweak it here and<br />there but it sort of comes to you from</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.720" end="01:18:26.740" style="s2">wherever the hell things like that come<br />from you know the unconscious that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.740" end="01:18:31.390" style="s2">psychoanalytic answer it&#39;s not really<br />much of an answer because it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.390" end="01:18:36.790" style="s2">a representation of a place that we<br />don&#39;t understand but that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.790" end="01:18:41.000" style="s2">creativity comes from and I mean some<br />people are really creative right down to</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.000" end="01:18:45.020" style="s2">the bloody core so in my clinical<br />practice I often see people who are high</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.020" end="01:18:49.140" style="s2">in openness because they&#39;re attracted to<br />me because they watch my lectures and</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.140" end="01:18:53.360" style="s2">you have to kind of be high in openness<br />to like my lectures so because well you</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.360" end="01:18:56.490" style="s2">do because they go everywhere you know<br />and and they&#39;re not necessarily very</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.490" end="01:19:02.280" style="s2">orderly so so anyways lots of my clients<br />are really high in openness and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.280" end="01:19:05.910" style="s2">funny people often especially if they&#39;re<br />smart because sometimes they have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.910" end="01:19:10.720" style="s2">most nihilistic intelligence you can<br />imagine it&#39;s just self-critical and</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.720" end="01:19:16.870" style="s2">nihilistic and brutally brutal man and<br />smart and so they just criticize</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.870" end="01:19:22.580" style="s2">themselves out of existence and so often<br />I have to just try to get them to quit</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.580" end="01:19:26.890" style="s2">listening to their chattering right<br />self-critical rationality and go out and</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.890" end="01:19:30.900" style="s2">create something you know with their<br />massive creativity and as long as</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.900" end="01:19:34.360" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that they&#39;re engaged in<br />the world and happy as hell but as soon</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.360" end="01:19:38.470" style="s2">as that self-critical rationality comes<br />in and shuts down the creativity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.470" end="01:19:43.370" style="s2">just they&#39;re just like walking corpses<br />you know and it&#39;s because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.370" end="01:19:48.630" style="s2">really open like that&#39;s your a tree and<br />it has some trunks and you know your</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.630" end="01:19:52.410" style="s2">your most prominent trait is the most<br />lively trunk and if you&#39;re a creative</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.410" end="01:19:56.490" style="s2">person and you&#39;re not engaging in a<br />creative enterprise</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.490" end="01:20:00.950" style="s2">you&#39;re just you&#39;re like a tree that that<br />has been that has had its vitality</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.950" end="01:20:07.360" style="s2">amputated and so this is not trivial<br />this stuff is this is deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.360" end="01:20:13.400" style="s2">deeply rooted in your biology and and<br />those are people often who have like</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.400" end="01:20:16.239" style="s2">dream lives you just can&#39;t believe I<br />have one client</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.239" end="01:20:20.170" style="s2">he has like four spectacular<br />dreams a week and most of the time we</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.170" end="01:20:25.930" style="s2">just spend discussing them I mean God he<br />and I had another client who could be</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.930" end="01:20:29.530" style="s2">lucid in her dreams which is more common<br />among women she could ask the damn</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.530" end="01:20:34.050" style="s2">characters what they represented and<br />they would tell her it was like okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.050" end="01:20:37.760" style="s2">that was pretty weird and like a lot of<br />the things they told her were really</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.760" end="01:20:43.970" style="s2">helpful and they were not things that<br />she wanted to hear she she basically one</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.970" end="01:20:47.660" style="s2">of them told her she if she was gonna<br />live she&#39;d have to go visit a</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.660" end="01:20:52.830" style="s2">slaughterhouse and the reason for that<br />was because she was raised as a little</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.830" end="01:20:57.640" style="s2">princess and protected from horrible<br />mother nature until she hit puberty in</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.640" end="01:21:00.840" style="s2">which time she turned into an evil<br />villain because that&#39;s how the family</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.840" end="01:21:06.670" style="s2">worked perfect child<br />evil teenager overnight and then well</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.670" end="01:21:09.600" style="s2">that was hard on her and she wasn&#39;t<br />prepared because she thought the world</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.600" end="01:21:13.011" style="s2">was princess world and you know she<br />couldn&#39;t go through a butcher store</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.011" end="01:21:18.870" style="s2">without having a fit and no wonder you<br />know like really Jesus you know it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.870" end="01:21:23.720" style="s2">wonder but you do it but she couldn&#39;t so<br />we used to go to butcher stores and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.720" end="01:21:28.620" style="s2">would make her cry and and that she was<br />a vegetarian that would make her cry and</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.620" end="01:21:32.970" style="s2">you know bemoan the cruelty of the world<br />and it&#39;s like yeah fair enough man those</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.970" end="01:21:36.670" style="s2">are bloody slabs of meat it&#39;s like I<br />don&#39;t know why everyone isn&#39;t screaming</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.670" end="01:21:41.489" style="s2">when they walk through the butcher store<br />but but you got to get used to it man</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.489" end="01:21:45.530" style="s2">because you can&#39;t live in the world<br />otherwise and so the dream character who</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.530" end="01:21:49.400" style="s2">was a gypsy told her that she had to go<br />visit a slaughterhouse which seemed</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.400" end="01:21:54.130" style="s2">rather impractical and so I asked her if<br />she could think of anything else to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.130" end="01:21:57.940" style="s2">and she saw it well why don&#39;t we go<br />visit a funeral home and and watch an</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.940" end="01:22:02.830" style="s2">embalming and I thought oh how good that<br />sounds that sounds like a fun way to</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.830" end="01:22:10.640" style="s2">spend a day and so I phoned up a funeral<br />parlor and I said I had a client it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.640" end="01:22:14.650" style="s2">terrified of death yeah and I was the<br />therapist who was also a little shaky on</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.650" end="01:22:20.620" style="s2">the concept myself and so they they had<br />no problem with that they deal with</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.620" end="01:22:23.610" style="s2">death all the time which is really<br />something to think about right a human</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.610" end="01:22:27.910" style="s2">being can actually have an occupation<br />where they do nothing but deal with</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.910" end="01:22:32.210" style="s2">death and they don&#39;t go stark raving mad<br />it&#39;s like what the hell&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.210" end="01:22:35.590" style="s2">with that it&#39;s like working in a<br />palliative care ward where your your</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.590" end="01:22:39.970" style="s2">clients that you you know have a<br />relationship all they&#39;re gonna do is die</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.970" end="01:22:44.940" style="s2">this week next week the week after<br />people do that it&#39;s like those people</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.940" end="01:22:50.360" style="s2">are tough man they&#39;re tough so anyways<br />we went and watched this embalming which</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.360" end="01:22:56.690" style="s2">was I have a rather high level of<br />disgust sensitivity so it was a little</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.690" end="01:23:02.440" style="s2">on the rough side for me but she sat<br />there and first while she was not we</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.440" end="01:23:06.520" style="s2">were outside this little room she was<br />not looking at that man no way and she</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.520" end="01:23:10.020" style="s2">kind of go like this and you know that<br />was pretty good and then she&#39;d go like</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.020" end="01:23:17.330" style="s2">this and then she go like this and then<br />and she watched it and then she asked if</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.330" end="01:23:21.110" style="s2">she could go in and she put on the glove<br />and she touched the body and she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.110" end="01:23:26.350" style="s2">have a fit she didn&#39;t have a panic<br />attack and so she walked away from there</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.350" end="01:23:29.370" style="s2">learning that there was a hell of a lot<br />more to her than she thought there was</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.370" end="01:23:33.440" style="s2">and that she could see things that she<br />didn&#39;t think she could see and live and</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.440" end="01:23:37.340" style="s2">after that she sort of had a touchstone<br />it&#39;s like well I&#39;m kind of afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.340" end="01:23:40.110" style="s2">this well is it as bad as going to see<br />the embalming</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.110" end="01:23:44.460" style="s2">no it&#39;s not that bad well I guess I can<br />do it it&#39;s like an initiation right she</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.460" end="01:23:50.120" style="s2">had an initiation and so did I you know<br />and I learned a lot from doing that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.120" end="01:23:53.000" style="s2">learned that one of the things you need<br />to do if you&#39;re going to be a human</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.000" end="01:23:57.530" style="s2">being is to prepare yourself to be<br />useful in the face of death and so when</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.530" end="01:24:01.700" style="s2">you have a parent that dies which you<br />know shatters people&#39;s ideas often they</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.700" end="01:24:06.340" style="s2">can&#39;t even think about it if you can&#39;t<br />even think about that man you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.340" end="01:24:10.970" style="s2">some thinking to do because you need to<br />be able to at least think about that</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.970" end="01:24:15.450" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;re just gonna be a<br />wasteland when it happens and you never</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.450" end="01:24:19.380" style="s2">know you could even have a higher<br />ambition maybe you could even be useful</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.380" end="01:24:24.080" style="s2">when it happens instead of being part of<br />the heap of destroyed people who also</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.080" end="01:24:29.230" style="s2">have to be taken care of you know and<br />that&#39;s brutal you have to be brutal to</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.230" end="01:24:32.930" style="s2">be useful in the aftermath of your<br />parents death you know you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.930" end="01:24:39.670" style="s2">crumble and fall apart and no you have<br />every reason to so you got to be kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.670" end="01:24:43.520" style="s2">some tough monster to manage that but<br />you want to be useful in the face of</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.520" end="01:24:54.050" style="s2">tragedy or do you want to be<br />well you make your choice so out of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.050" end="01:24:58.340" style="s2">unconscious you get ritual you get<br />dreams you get drama you get stories you</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.340" end="01:25:03.350" style="s2">get art you get music and that sort of<br />buffers us we have our little domain of</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.350" end="01:25:07.970" style="s2">competence and we&#39;re buffered by the<br />domain of fantasy and culture and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.970" end="01:25:11.250" style="s2">really what you learn about when you<br />come to university if you&#39;re lucky and</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.250" end="01:25:13.880" style="s2">and the professors are smart enough to<br />actually teach you something about</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.880" end="01:25:18.280" style="s2">culture instead of constantly telling<br />you that it&#39;s completely reprehensible</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.280" end="01:25:22.700" style="s2">and should be destroyed it&#39;s like why<br />you would prefer chaos to order is</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.700" end="01:25:27.500" style="s2">beyond me and the only possible reason<br />is that you haven&#39;t read enough history</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.500" end="01:25:33.040" style="s2">to understand exactly what chaos means<br />and believe me if you understood what it</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.040" end="01:25:37.760" style="s2">means you&#39;d be pretty goddamn careful<br />about tearing down the temple that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.760" end="01:25:44.510" style="s2">live in unless you want to be a denizen<br />of chaos and some people do you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.510" end="01:25:49.340" style="s2">because that&#39;s when the impulses that<br />you Harbor can really come out and shine</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.340" end="01:25:54.810" style="s2">and so a little gratitude is in order<br />and that makes you appreciative of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.810" end="01:25:59.630" style="s2">wise King well being smart enough to<br />know that he&#39;s also an evil tyrant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.630" end="01:26:04.420" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s a total conception of<br />the world it&#39;s balanced it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.420" end="01:26:09.420" style="s2">we should preserve nature but good god<br />it is trying to kill us and you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.420" end="01:26:13.970" style="s2">yes our culture is tyrannical and<br />oppressive people but it is protecting</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.970" end="01:26:19.600" style="s2">us from dying that&#39;s helpful you know<br />and yes we&#39;re reasonably good people but</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.600" end="01:26:24.260" style="s2">like don&#39;t take that theory too far<br />until you&#39;ve tested yourself and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.260" end="01:26:28.340" style="s2">know that&#39;s wisdom at least in part and<br />that&#39;s what these stories try to teach</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.340" end="01:26:34.810" style="s2">you<br />there&#39;s a nice mythological</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.810" end="01:26:40.670" style="s2">representation I love this one it&#39;s like<br />the Dome of the known and the seeker</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.670" end="01:26:46.000" style="s2">looking outside you know that&#39;s a that&#39;s<br />a metaphysical representation you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.000" end="01:26:49.371" style="s2">and then that is the world as it looks<br />to us right you go out in a field and it</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.371" end="01:26:53.530" style="s2">looks like there&#39;s a dome covering it<br />it&#39;s a circle a big circle with a dome</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.530" end="01:26:57.910" style="s2">over it and you know what&#39;s outside the<br />dome well the unknown right that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.910" end="01:27:01.560" style="s2">heaven is theoretically<br />you know it&#39;s a projection obviously</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.560" end="01:27:05.590" style="s2">heaven is in the unknown well it was<br />localized in space</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.590" end="01:27:08.430" style="s2">I suppose that&#39;s partly because when<br />people looked up in the sky they were</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.430" end="01:27:15.610" style="s2">overwhelmed with all so it&#39;s a<br />reasonable conclusion you know it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.610" end="01:27:19.520" style="s2">projection of an unconscious<br />presupposition it&#39;s a projection of</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.520" end="01:27:25.930" style="s2">fantasy you know heaven is a fantasy and<br />and I&#39;m not denigrating fantasy by the</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.930" end="01:27:30.311" style="s2">way and it&#39;s projected imaginatively<br />onto the sky and that&#39;s part of the way</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.311" end="01:27:35.880" style="s2">you discover what&#39;s in your fantasy well<br />this is us man we mediate between chaos</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.880" end="01:27:40.760" style="s2">and order and you know those are the two<br />archetypal representations fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.760" end="01:27:47.880" style="s2">you know and I think they apply to both<br />genders you know like women can act as</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.880" end="01:27:54.390" style="s2">the individual who holds the world on<br />his or her shoulders and males men can</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.390" end="01:28:00.650" style="s2">play a maternal role you know meet<br />female human beings are quite masculine</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.650" end="01:28:04.980" style="s2">and male human beings are quite feminine<br />and so you know maybe maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.980" end="01:28:09.650" style="s2">archetype dominates among men and that<br />archetype dominates among women which I</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.650" end="01:28:13.540" style="s2">would say is that is the case as far as<br />I&#39;m concerned although there in our</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.540" end="01:28:16.840" style="s2">individual conceptions and of course<br />those two things have to work in</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.840" end="01:28:24.660" style="s2">conjunction but that&#39;s you the eternal<br />mediator between chaos and order which</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.660" end="01:28:31.440" style="s2">also has its enemy so that&#39;s that&#39;s<br />Horace there and that Seth who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.440" end="01:28:37.489" style="s2">eventually turns into Satan as though as<br />the West progresses so to speak and</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.489" end="01:28:43.380" style="s2">that&#39;s represented there as well the<br />temptations of I would say resentment</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.380" end="01:28:49.450" style="s2">and hatred which everyone has to fight<br />with all the time all right</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.450" end="01:28:55.220" style="s2">initiations so this is cool this is a<br />standard hero story and initiate</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.220" end="01:28:59.010" style="s2">initiative rights are a part of human<br />heritage and so let&#39;s take a look this</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.010" end="01:29:02.090" style="s2">is from el yada<br />I would like even now to stress the fact</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.090" end="01:29:06.590" style="s2">that the psychopathology of the shamanic<br />vocation is not profaned</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.590" end="01:29:10.560" style="s2">it does not belong to ordinary<br />symptomatology it&#39;s not mental illness</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.560" end="01:29:13.790" style="s2">it has an int initiatory structure and<br />signification</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.790" end="01:29:18.350" style="s2">short it reproduces a traditional<br />mystical pattern the total crisis of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.350" end="01:29:22.070" style="s2">future shaman sometimes leading to<br />complete disintegration of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.070" end="01:29:26.950" style="s2">personality and to madness can be<br />valuated not only as an initiatory death</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.950" end="01:29:31.830" style="s2">but also as a symbolic returned to the<br />pre cosmogonic chaos to the amorphous</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.830" end="01:29:35.970" style="s2">and indescribable state that precedes<br />any comes Morgan II well what he means</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.970" end="01:29:40.570" style="s2">by that is that I suppose the<br />mythological view of the emergence of</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.570" end="01:29:46.310" style="s2">order that&#39;s a cosmogony is that there&#39;s<br />a state of potential and chaos out of</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.310" end="01:29:52.560" style="s2">which order emerges and you know here&#39;s<br />here&#39;s how it is that you think that way</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.560" end="01:29:56.750" style="s2">because you do think that way so you<br />know imagine what you&#39;re facing when</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.750" end="01:30:00.590" style="s2">you&#39;re facing the future right well you<br />might say well the future is full of</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.590" end="01:30:05.860" style="s2">potential right it&#39;s full of potential<br />what the hell does that mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.860" end="01:30:10.730" style="s2">you act as if that you act as if that<br />potential is really a real thing and</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.730" end="01:30:14.090" style="s2">you&#39;re confronting it all the time I&#39;m<br />confronting the potential of the future</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.090" end="01:30:19.200" style="s2">well it doesn&#39;t exist yet so did what<br />you&#39;re confronting doesn&#39;t even really</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.200" end="01:30:22.950" style="s2">exist what you&#39;re conceptualizing<br />doesn&#39;t really exist and in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.950" end="01:30:27.970" style="s2">you bring it into being by plotting your<br />path through it well the pre cosmogonic</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.970" end="01:30:32.340" style="s2">chaos is the same as the potential of<br />the future it&#39;s exactly the same idea</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.340" end="01:30:39.489" style="s2">it&#39;s the realm of possibility from which<br />actuality emerges and you participate in</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.489" end="01:30:44.450" style="s2">turning that possibility into actuality<br />that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing all the time</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.450" end="01:30:52.220" style="s2">now can I explain that well no I have no<br />idea how consciousness and the substrate</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.220" end="01:30:56.451" style="s2">of the world interact<br />i I can only say that that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.451" end="01:31:01.030" style="s2">looks that&#39;s how it feels<br />you know that&#39;s how people act and</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.030" end="01:31:05.840" style="s2">they&#39;ll get into trouble if they don&#39;t<br />manifest their potential whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.840" end="01:31:10.760" style="s2">is that&#39;s all those things you could be<br />that you&#39;re not well where are those</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.760" end="01:31:18.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just potential well that&#39;s the<br />chaos this is a that&#39;s the I would say</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.920" end="01:31:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the the cosmos that&#39;s the cosmos<br />that you live in all the time it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.200" end="01:31:27.119" style="s2">little story it&#39;s the thing that you<br />extract out of the chaos it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.119" end="01:31:31.989" style="s2">- consists of your conception of where<br />you are now and your conception of where</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.989" end="01:31:36.320" style="s2">you want to be at some point could be<br />ten minutes could be three years if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.320" end="01:31:41.910" style="s2">can slide it and then you have a little<br />plan about how you should move your body</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.910" end="01:31:46.360" style="s2">to do transform one in into the other<br />that&#39;s your action powder and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.360" end="01:31:49.989" style="s2">little story and when you ask someone to<br />say what they were up to you they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.989" end="01:31:54.150" style="s2">tell you a little story like that you<br />know I was at some place and I went</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.150" end="01:31:56.920" style="s2">somewhere else and here&#39;s how I did it<br />then they might tell you more</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.920" end="01:32:03.200" style="s2">interesting story which is I was<br />someplace and something happened that I</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.200" end="01:32:09.780" style="s2">really didn&#39;t expect and it knocked me<br />for a loop you know and that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.780" end="01:32:16.489" style="s2">divorce story I came home one night and<br />my wife was gone it&#39;s like yeah chaos</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.489" end="01:32:21.280" style="s2">and probably a bit of willful blindness<br />preceding it we might suspect</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.280" end="01:32:25.350" style="s2">anyways down into chaos and then well<br />maybe you learn something down there and</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.350" end="01:32:28.410" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t but hopefully you do and<br />you put yourself together if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.410" end="01:32:33.650" style="s2">lucky and then pop bang you pop up into<br />another little structure of order and</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.650" end="01:32:38.970" style="s2">that&#39;s an initiatory process it&#39;s like<br />you&#39;re some more stable falls apart or</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.970" end="01:32:43.550" style="s2">maybe you break it apart on purpose you<br />do it voluntarily you know people do</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.550" end="01:32:47.770" style="s2">that all the time you know they do that<br />for example when they experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.770" end="01:32:51.511" style="s2">drugs and they do that when they go on<br />wild adventures and you know when they</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.511" end="01:32:56.260" style="s2">break themselves out of their normal<br />routine and throw themselves somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.260" end="01:33:00.170" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand and hope that<br />that&#39;s going to produce a transformation</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.170" end="01:33:05.310" style="s2">of personality that&#39;s the basic story<br />that&#39;s the initiatory story now this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.310" end="01:33:10.160" style="s2">William James who was the one of the<br />establishes of modern psychology and a</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.160" end="01:33:14.230" style="s2">kind of an odd guy he was an early<br />experimenter with psychedelics of course</p>

<p begin="01:39:09.280" end="01:39:12.590" style="s2">from doing that it&#39;s like where did she<br />get that idea</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.590" end="01:39:22.590" style="s2">well good work kiddo she had plenty of<br />dragons in her life so the following</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.590" end="01:39:25.820" style="s2">dream was described by my daughter<br />Mikayla three years nine months old</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.820" end="01:39:30.570" style="s2">about my son Julian one year Julian was<br />in the process of toilet training and</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.570" end="01:39:34.260" style="s2">rapid speech development was having some<br />trouble controlling his emotions Mikayla</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.260" end="01:39:37.239" style="s2">liked to call him baby<br />we had several discussions about the</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.239" end="01:39:40.680" style="s2">fact that he wasn&#39;t really a baby<br />anymore she told me this story while I</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.680" end="01:39:44.200" style="s2">was at the computer so I was able to get<br />it for Batum she wasn&#39;t very happy with</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.200" end="01:39:47.930" style="s2">the idea that he wasn&#39;t a baby anymore<br />because she kind of liked the baby she</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.930" end="01:39:51.450" style="s2">took care of that baby a lot and her<br />little brain was having a hard time with</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.450" end="01:39:55.450" style="s2">the notion that whatever that thing is<br />now it isn&#39;t a baby it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.450" end="01:39:59.360" style="s2">where&#39;s my baby and believe me plenty of<br />mothers go through the same thing then</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.360" end="01:40:03.670" style="s2">they attempt to keep their children<br />babies for the rest of their lives so</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.670" end="01:40:07.360" style="s2">this is what Mikayla said the dream<br />Julian&#39;s eyes fell out and then he</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.360" end="01:40:13.050" style="s2">falled into pieces I said what sort of<br />pieces she said Julian pieces and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.050" end="01:40:17.460" style="s2">bones fall doubt too then a hole got him<br />and there was water in it and when he</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.460" end="01:40:22.480" style="s2">came out he was big mom Julian isn&#39;t a<br />baby anymore no he</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.480" end="01:40:26.760" style="s2">a big boy and a bug with legs got him<br />out cuz bugs can swim and the whole was</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.760" end="01:40:30.520" style="s2">in the park and it moved into the<br />backyard and he fall into it a tree</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.520" end="01:40:36.180" style="s2">burned and left the hole I thought wow<br />that&#39;s so amazing it&#39;s like it was a it</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.180" end="01:40:40.470" style="s2">was a shamanic transformation dream it<br />was like the tree that&#39;s The Tree of</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.470" end="01:40:44.719" style="s2">Life had burnt and left a hole the kid<br />fell into it it dissolved him right down</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.719" end="01:40:49.840" style="s2">to his bones this little bug which would<br />be a union representation of the self</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.840" end="01:40:53.880" style="s2">like Jiminy Cricket by the way in<br />Pinocchio the bug was the thing that was</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.880" end="01:40:56.870" style="s2">alive that helped him through the<br />transformation he stepped out and now he</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.870" end="01:41:01.990" style="s2">was big it&#39;s like that was her little<br />brain conjuring up the notion of radical</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.990" end="01:41:07.650" style="s2">transformation so this is cool I hope<br />this works</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.650" end="01:41:12.989" style="s2">this is a dream that my my nephew had<br />did someone animated Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.989" end="01:41:16.750" style="s2">a clinical psychologist from the<br />University of Toronto Maya do disagree</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.750" end="01:41:20.980" style="s2">with some of his fundamental ideas but<br />his thoughts and facing problems merge</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.980" end="01:41:27.170" style="s2">with my stoic values within one of his<br />maps of meaning lectures he tells a true</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.170" end="01:41:31.880" style="s2">story about a four year old boy his<br />nephew who for months was suffering from</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.880" end="01:41:37.410" style="s2">terrible night terrors terrors that were<br />waking him up screaming this boy by the</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.410" end="01:41:42.030" style="s2">way did have some areas of instability<br />in his family life Jordan visited the</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.030" end="01:41:46.820" style="s2">young boy&#39;s house and the boy was<br />running around dressed as an eight with</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.820" end="01:41:49.840" style="s2">a sword a shield and a helmet at night<br />aim he would take a sword and shield to</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.840" end="01:41:54.950" style="s2">bed so Jordan got speaking to him and<br />the boy described his dream and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.950" end="01:41:59.690" style="s2">dream he&#39;s standing surrounded by<br />knee-high Dwarfs these dwarves had beaks</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.690" end="01:42:04.640" style="s2">and every time you would try to move the<br />dwarfs would jump up and bait him a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.640" end="01:42:09.300" style="s2">fretting scenario for a young boy and if<br />you look behind all the dwarfs away in</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.300" end="01:42:12.820" style="s2">the background there was a dragon and<br />every time this dragon would puff out</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.820" end="01:42:17.400" style="s2">fire and smoke more dwarfs would be<br />created so there&#39;s no point fighting off</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.400" end="01:42:20.080" style="s2">the dwarfs because more would just be me<br />it</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.080" end="01:42:24.900" style="s2">so Jordan tapped him and asked what<br />could you do about that so the kid says</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.900" end="01:42:29.610" style="s2">he could jump up on the Dragons head he<br />could poke out his eyes with a sword so</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.610" end="01:42:34.050" style="s2">he couldn&#39;t see then they could go go<br />down the throat to the box where the</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.050" end="01:42:39.739" style="s2">fire came from carve a piece out of that<br />box thereby destroying it and use that</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.739" end="01:42:45.560" style="s2">piece as a sheet its shamed before<br />Jordan arrived was already a keynote in</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.560" end="01:42:50.810" style="s2">life what he knew he had to do and after<br />that conversation he had no more Nate</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.810" end="01:42:56.330" style="s2">pears this is what Marcus really is<br />meant when he said the impediment to</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.330" end="01:43:02.430" style="s2">action advances action what stands in<br />the way becomes the way he was tell not</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.430" end="01:43:06.090" style="s2">us that we must not shy away from<br />problems or shown or personal</p>

<p begin="01:43:10.770" end="01:43:17.800" style="s2">her problems to solve them and then take<br />something away well there you go so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.800" end="01:43:21.010" style="s2">he was waking up screaming at night for<br />four weeks</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.010" end="01:43:24.360" style="s2">that&#39;s night terrorist he couldn&#39;t<br />really remember what hell was going on</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.360" end="01:43:28.860" style="s2">and there was instability and his family<br />his parents got divorced soon after and</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.860" end="01:43:33.230" style="s2">he was off to kindergarten and that was<br />kind of destabilizing him too and so it</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.230" end="01:43:37.340" style="s2">was fun to watch him zip around as a<br />knight it&#39;s like you know where&#39;d he get</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.340" end="01:43:42.239" style="s2">that idea well you know he watched TV<br />watch movies see his little imagination</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.239" end="01:43:46.890" style="s2">was aggregating the picture of the hero<br />and then he was trying to act it out</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.890" end="01:43:50.570" style="s2">that&#39;s what he was doing pretending<br />right I&#39;m pretending to be the thing</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.570" end="01:43:54.590" style="s2">that takes on the unknown and then he<br />has this amazing dream it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.590" end="01:43:58.410" style="s2">mind-boggling it&#39;s so sophisticated it&#39;s<br />like well here I am</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.410" end="01:44:02.610" style="s2">and there&#39;s troubles everywhere and<br />they&#39;re biting me they&#39;re jumping up on</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.610" end="01:44:06.990" style="s2">me and it&#39;s like a Hydra you know in the<br />Hydra you cut off a hydras head and</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.990" end="01:44:11.460" style="s2">seven more heads grow it&#39;s like that&#39;s<br />life man solve one problem seven more</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.460" end="01:44:17.550" style="s2">appear right so also that that was the<br />Dragons at the background chaos itself</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.550" end="01:44:23.770" style="s2">and chaos kept breeding these are the<br />evil little Dwarfs which is what it does</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.770" end="01:44:26.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s one damn trouble after<br />another we fight this one off fight this</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.890" end="01:44:31.210" style="s2">one off it&#39;s like who cares the dragon<br />the dwarf generating machine is still</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.210" end="01:44:35.440" style="s2">working in the background so he<br />I asked him and that was purposeful what</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.440" end="01:44:39.820" style="s2">could you do<br />see that&#39;s a leading question that</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.820" end="01:44:44.360" style="s2">implies that there&#39;s something that he<br />could do he said well I take my dad that</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.360" end="01:44:49.400" style="s2">was missing in the animation and we go<br />well poke the dragon&#39;s eyes out go right</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.400" end="01:44:54.770" style="s2">down to the source of the problem<br />extinguish it make a shield right so</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.770" end="01:44:57.831" style="s2">that meant that he would have<br />strengthened his character by the</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.831" end="01:45:05.680" style="s2">encounter so brilliant and then and I<br />talked to his mom for months afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.680" end="01:45:11.320" style="s2">done no more night terrors what had<br />happened he identified with the</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.320" end="01:45:15.300" style="s2">mythological hero he did identified with<br />st. George and the dragon he identified</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.300" end="01:45:20.740" style="s2">with that little bloody tree dwelling<br />primate who 20 million years ago was the</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.740" end="01:45:26.680" style="s2">first one to drop a stick on a snake he<br />adopted the classic human mode of being</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.680" end="01:45:34.240" style="s2">in the face of uncertainty and construed<br />himself as that which could prevail end</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.240" end="01:45:46.300" style="s2">of terrors well I guess we&#39;re done E so<br />we&#39;re gonna do something a little</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.300" end="01:45:50.880" style="s2">different than the syllabus today<br />because you know we got this one hour to</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.880" end="01:45:55.830" style="s2">our problem and I really can&#39;t cover<br />constructionism reasonably in two hours</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.830" end="01:45:57.820" style="s2">or one hour that was supposed to be<br />today</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.820" end="01:46:02.170" style="s2">so what I&#39;m going to do is instead is<br />continue on the line that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.170" end="01:46:07.239" style="s2">pursuing but I&#39;m going to expand it up<br />more into Union psychology which is the</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.239" end="01:46:11.251" style="s2">what we&#39;re going after after<br />constructivism anyways and so I can</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.251" end="01:46:15.320" style="s2">weave the constructivism and the depth<br />psychology together and it&#39;s nice to do</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.320" end="01:46:19.090" style="s2">that because it gives you a kind of a<br />coherent view so just so you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.090" end="01:46:23.650" style="s2">one lecture ahead at the moment roughly<br />speaking and I&#39;ll do constructivism on</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.650" end="01:46:29.130" style="s2">Tuesday for two hours so all right so I<br />showed you that anime animation I told</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.130" end="01:46:33.960" style="s2">you about my nephew&#39;s dream which is a<br />remarkable dream you know really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.960" end="01:46:40.610" style="s2">just amazing amazing dream and it&#39;s it&#39;s<br />got this archetypal pattern you know and</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.610" end="01:46:45.340" style="s2">the pattern is that there&#39;s a threat and<br />worse than not that there&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.340" end="01:46:49.230" style="s2">threats<br />and at the back of it there is the the</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.230" end="01:46:55.090" style="s2">fact of threat itself you see so human<br />beings were so smart hey so this is so</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.090" end="01:46:59.840" style="s2">amazing that we figured this out so you<br />imagine well human beings are the only</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.840" end="01:47:03.550" style="s2">creatures that can really conceive of<br />the class of all threatening things</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.550" end="01:47:07.219" style="s2">right and that&#39;s kind of why we can be<br />permanently anxious there&#39;s so it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.219" end="01:47:13.510" style="s2">of annoying so you know here you are and<br />it&#39;s safe there&#39;s no Lions here or or</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.510" end="01:47:19.260" style="s2">anything that might prey on you but you<br />can think of something to be anxious</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.260" end="01:47:23.500" style="s2">about no problem you know I&#39;m certain<br />you&#39;ve got some little skeleton rattling</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.500" end="01:47:28.810" style="s2">around in your closet somewhere that&#39;s<br />like eating away at you and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.810" end="01:47:33.280" style="s2">part of the reason we&#39;re so damn awake<br />human beings is because we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.280" end="01:47:38.970" style="s2">anxious like and you have to be awake<br />when you&#39;re anxious and the the anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.970" end="01:47:42.910" style="s2">system actually activates your reticular<br />activating system and that that that</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.910" end="01:47:49.510" style="s2">actually produces its the substrate for<br />consciousness if you snap a few fibers</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.510" end="01:47:53.190" style="s2">in the back of your brain that are part<br />of the reticulating activate reticular</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.190" end="01:47:56.630" style="s2">activating system in a car accident or<br />something you&#39;ll go into a coma and</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.630" end="01:48:00.050" style="s2">that&#39;ll be that here you&#39;re not getting<br />out of it doesn&#39;t take much of an injury</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.050" end="01:48:05.090" style="s2">either in the right place so anyways so<br />human beings have been struggling with</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.090" end="01:48:10.980" style="s2">this problem of threat forever<br />really for as long as there&#39;s been life</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.980" end="01:48:14.280" style="s2">or at least as long as there&#39;s been life<br />with a nervous system and you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.280" end="01:48:20.550" style="s2">that&#39;s several hundred million years<br />it&#39;s a long time and of course it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.550" end="01:48:24.400" style="s2">to you know to respond to a particular<br />threat think about zebras they&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.400" end="01:48:28.110" style="s2">there on the veldt and there&#39;s lions<br />everywhere right but the zebras are like</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.110" end="01:48:32.840" style="s2">they&#39;re calmed because there&#39;s lions are<br />sleeping and so the zebras don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.840" end="01:48:38.240" style="s2">apparently oh my god what was going to<br />happen with those Lions wake up because</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.240" end="01:48:41.390" style="s2">they don&#39;t think that way you know and<br />they&#39;re not going to be happy if the</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.390" end="01:48:45.980" style="s2">lion goes into a hunting Crouch and<br />starts its hunting approach obviously</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.980" end="01:48:50.570" style="s2">but it&#39;s not like the zebras are<br />freaking out non-stop because there are</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.570" end="01:48:55.460" style="s2">Lions around you know so they can react<br />to specific threats but human beings</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.460" end="01:48:59.560" style="s2">partly because we discovered the future<br />which was a big mistake was a big</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.560" end="01:49:02.900" style="s2">mistake<br />because the future is an uncertain place</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.900" end="01:49:06.780" style="s2">we realized that well there isn&#39;t any<br />threat right now but there might well be</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.780" end="01:49:10.600" style="s2">some tomorrow and if there isn&#39;t some<br />tomorrow well maybe next week or next</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.600" end="01:49:15.880" style="s2">month or next year like it&#39;s coming and<br />so there&#39;s danger so it&#39;s the category</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.880" end="01:49:21.010" style="s2">of danger you know and out of the<br />category of danger emerged specific</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.010" end="01:49:27.320" style="s2">threats and the dragon seems to be a<br />symbol of it is a symbol I believe of</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.320" end="01:49:33.340" style="s2">the ever-present fact of predatory<br />slightly predatory threat but our</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.340" end="01:49:37.900" style="s2">nervous systems as they&#39;ve become<br />capable of abstraction have used that</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.900" end="01:49:42.710" style="s2">underlying architecture to represent<br />more abstract categories so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.710" end="01:49:46.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not a predator like a dragon is not<br />a predator because there are no dragons</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.120" end="01:49:51.730" style="s2">but maybe a dragon is a snake and a and<br />a crocodile and maybe a leopard and</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.730" end="01:49:56.570" style="s2">maybe a predatory bird all mangled into<br />one monster because a monster is</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.570" end="01:50:00.070" style="s2">actually technically something that&#39;s<br />made out of disparate parts and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.070" end="01:50:05.370" style="s2">a good symbolic representation for the<br />unknown as such that which lies beyond</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.370" end="01:50:10.310" style="s2">the campfire let&#39;s say and what lurks<br />out there and so the eternal problem is</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.310" end="01:50:14.690" style="s2">what the hell do you do with the dragon<br />and that also explains why the dragon</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.690" end="01:50:18.940" style="s2">typically is a treasure garter right<br />because it&#39;s even more the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.940" end="01:50:23.340" style="s2">even worse out there<br />in no-man&#39;s land out there in potential</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.340" end="01:50:27.420" style="s2">there&#39;s threat and and and like mortal<br />threat but there&#39;s also endless</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.420" end="01:50:32.520" style="s2">opportunity and riches and wealth and<br />and and the possibility of attracting</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.520" end="01:50:35.610" style="s2">someone and all of that and so well the<br />dragon</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.610" end="01:50:39.630" style="s2">you can&#39;t just be afraid of it you just<br />stay in your burrow the whole time and</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.630" end="01:50:43.469" style="s2">lots of animals more or less do that is<br />you know especially the nocturnal ones</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.469" end="01:50:46.590" style="s2">they just hide away but that is what<br />human beings alight because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.590" end="01:50:50.390" style="s2">only prey animals right we&#39;re also<br />predators and then of course we&#39;re crazy</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.390" end="01:50:54.910" style="s2">we&#39;re absolutely insane chimpanzees<br />right we&#39;re crazy and so we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.910" end="01:51:00.070" style="s2">out there mucking about with things and<br />with our you know fingers and and our</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.070" end="01:51:04.550" style="s2">thumbs and and taking the world apart<br />and putting it back together and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.550" end="01:51:09.310" style="s2">crazily exploratory and and in<br />troublemaking and so we don&#39;t just run</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.310" end="01:51:17.550" style="s2">from dragons we go hunt them down and so<br />and so there&#39;s a story here there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.550" end="01:51:20.910" style="s2">oldest story that mankind knows and<br />literally it is the oldest story that we</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.910" end="01:51:26.060" style="s2">know is this stories in this story<br />basically is there&#39;s a bounded space a</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.060" end="01:51:29.760" style="s2">walled garden a walled city you know on<br />all the original cities were walled</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.760" end="01:51:34.350" style="s2">because if they weren&#39;t barbarians would<br />swoop in and they&#39;d just steal all your</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.350" end="01:51:38.010" style="s2">stuff and so you know that was kind of<br />pointless so you know you wanted to have</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.010" end="01:51:42.920" style="s2">some major-league walls surrounding your<br />territory and so that&#39;s inhabited space</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.920" end="01:51:47.200" style="s2">and inside that is here little dominance<br />hierarchy and so all you primates knew</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.200" end="01:51:50.731" style="s2">exactly who was who inside that space so<br />you didn&#39;t have to fight with each other</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.731" end="01:51:54.050" style="s2">and you could predict each other&#39;s<br />behavior because you believed the same</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.050" end="01:51:58.030" style="s2">things and saw the world roughly the<br />same way and acted the same way and so</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.030" end="01:52:02.010" style="s2">you were sort of secure but then the<br />problem is is that that can always be</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.010" end="01:52:05.510" style="s2">breached there&#39;s always something<br />outside of it that&#39;s a danger and so</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.510" end="01:52:12.010" style="s2">that&#39;s signified by this this little<br />creature here this is dragon and that</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.010" end="01:52:16.449" style="s2">that twirl in its tail is very common<br />among dragons actually it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.449" end="01:52:21.680" style="s2">symbol because you imagistic languages<br />imagistic symbols have an ancient</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.680" end="01:52:26.270" style="s2">language and it it&#39;s referring to<br />something that&#39;s basically eternal and</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.270" end="01:52:30.550" style="s2">so it lives down here in this in this<br />cave because it&#39;s an underground thing</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.550" end="01:52:33.450" style="s2">it&#39;s an underground thing and you can<br />kind of imagine what that&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.450" end="01:52:37.550" style="s2">sometimes this happens in initiation<br />rituals among archaic people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.550" end="01:52:40.610" style="s2">gonna when they&#39;re gonna initiate<br />usually the young men because nature</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.610" end="01:52:45.010" style="s2">initiates women know by itself usually<br />the young men maybe they&#39;ll put them in</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.010" end="01:52:49.680" style="s2">a cave and leave them there you know for<br />like well who know who knows how long</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.680" end="01:52:54.180" style="s2">and Sagada think what&#39;s in a cave that<br />caves are dark man I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.180" end="01:52:59.110" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever been in one but like they&#39;re<br />dark and they&#39;re really dark and so not</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.110" end="01:53:02.760" style="s2">only is there whatever there is in the<br />cave and you don&#39;t know what the hell&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:53:07.260" end="01:53:10.969" style="s2">when you&#39;re in that cave and you&#39;re<br />alone you you&#39;re confronting the devils</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.969" end="01:53:14.820" style="s2">and demons and monsters of your own<br />imagination you know and so then you</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.820" end="01:53:18.510" style="s2">have a chance to perhaps deal with that<br />and overcome it and that&#39;s perhaps part</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.510" end="01:53:22.910" style="s2">of the initiation ceremony you know and<br />that&#39;s part of growing up because you</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.910" end="01:53:27.930" style="s2">have to learn how to face the things<br />that terrify and upset you and</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.930" end="01:53:31.780" style="s2">and we cast them and put them back<br />together we talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.780" end="01:53:38.719" style="s2">this idea of the pre cosmogonic chaos<br />that that Iliad it refers to and and</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.719" end="01:53:43.310" style="s2">that&#39;s this stuff out of which order is<br />produced at the beginning of time and</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.310" end="01:53:48.110" style="s2">it&#39;s also the stuff out of which you<br />constantly reproduce order and the young</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.110" end="01:53:52.969" style="s2">unions the psychoanalysts especially the<br />really deep psychoanalysts like young</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.969" end="01:53:56.469" style="s2">Freud was a more surface psychoanalyst<br />and that&#39;s not an insult there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.469" end="01:53:59.840" style="s2">things that Freud figured out they&#39;re<br />absolutely amazing he was a precursor to</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.840" end="01:54:05.260" style="s2">Jung for sure for Jung the hero&#39;s<br />journey was the journey inside the</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.260" end="01:54:10.360" style="s2">unconscious and that would be perhaps in<br />some sense that the the willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.360" end="01:54:13.430" style="s2">face everything terrible that&#39;s happened<br />to you and to think it through and to</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.430" end="01:54:17.340" style="s2">articulate it and and to come to grips<br />perhaps with your own capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.340" end="01:54:22.190" style="s2">malevolence that was a really important<br />part of Union ideas that the first step</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.190" end="01:54:26.100" style="s2">towards individuation which is the<br />manifestation of your full self let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.100" end="01:54:31.219" style="s2">say was the discovery of your shadow and<br />your shadow is the part of you that will</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.219" end="01:54:35.390" style="s2">do terrible things under the right<br />circumstances and maybe even without</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.390" end="01:54:39.610" style="s2">that much provocation and you know and<br />it&#39;s a terrifying part of you to come</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.610" end="01:54:42.980" style="s2">into contact with because it&#39;s sort of<br />it&#39;s sort of the way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.980" end="01:54:46.750" style="s2">specifically attached to the archetype<br />of evil that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.750" end="01:54:49.710" style="s2">thinking about it and you know modern<br />people they don&#39;t really think much</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.710" end="01:54:53.180" style="s2">about think much about the idea of good<br />and evil but that&#39;s because the most of</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.180" end="01:54:58.150" style="s2">them are so they I&#39;m naive you can just<br />barely even comprehend it you know if</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.150" end="01:55:04.000" style="s2">you read any history if you really read<br />it like and you and you don&#39;t come away</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.000" end="01:55:07.580" style="s2">with the idea that evil exists it&#39;s like<br />you&#39;re just reading the wrong kind of</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.580" end="01:55:13.530" style="s2">history you know it&#39;s just unbelievable<br />what people can do to each other and</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.530" end="01:55:17.440" style="s2">we&#39;re so imaginative you know and one of<br />the things I figured out about people</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.440" end="01:55:21.910" style="s2">the reason that we&#39;re we have the<br />knowledge of good and evil let&#39;s say is</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.910" end="01:55:26.131" style="s2">that because we&#39;re self conscious and we<br />know about ourselves we know about our</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.131" end="01:55:30.340" style="s2">own vulnerability right you know what<br />hurts you you really know what hurts you</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.340" end="01:55:34.180" style="s2">way more than an animal knows and so<br />when you&#39;re all so creative and so once</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.180" end="01:55:38.469" style="s2">you know what hurts you man you can<br />really hurt someone else and you can do</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.469" end="01:55:41.590" style="s2">it in such a creative way you can draw<br />it out you can</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.590" end="01:55:45.699" style="s2">make it excruciating you can take people<br />apart physically and psychologically and</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.699" end="01:55:49.489" style="s2">you can keep them say even right on the<br />edge of death so that you can keep doing</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.489" end="01:55:54.410" style="s2">that endlessly and you know that happens<br />hell of a lot more than you think it</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.410" end="01:56:00.590" style="s2">happens it happens a lot and so well and<br />you think well you know that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.590" end="01:56:04.610" style="s2">involve me it&#39;s like oh yes it does man<br />that&#39;s the problem because you know</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.610" end="01:56:07.760" style="s2">you&#39;re human and that&#39;s the sort of<br />things that human beings are capable of</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.760" end="01:56:13.320" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re all it&#39;s all<br />probable that you do that ever or or</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.320" end="01:56:18.860" style="s2">that but I&#39;m saying that you know you<br />got to take that into account when</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.860" end="01:56:21.380" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the world and you<br />think about all the perpetrators out</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.380" end="01:56:26.050" style="s2">there it&#39;s like it&#39;s not like there&#39;s<br />perpetrators and there&#39;s victims that</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.050" end="01:56:30.449" style="s2">isn&#39;t how it works it doesn&#39;t work that<br />way at all and so the horrors of</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.449" end="01:56:34.640" style="s2">humanity as well as the noble elements<br />of humanity are all elements of your</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.640" end="01:56:39.640" style="s2">central being and for you and this is<br />the terrible thing for young the pathway</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.640" end="01:56:43.870" style="s2">to higher wisdom was through the<br />terrible portal of well you could say</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.870" end="01:56:49.719" style="s2">hell for that matter really in and so<br />who wants to do that man it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.719" end="01:56:52.630" style="s2">you know like maybe you&#39;re resentful<br />about something well you probably are</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.630" end="01:56:56.180" style="s2">because like everybody&#39;s resentful about<br />something you know and resentment is</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.180" end="01:57:01.510" style="s2">just vicious emotion it&#39;s really useful<br />it&#39;s really useful because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.510" end="01:57:05.780" style="s2">resentful about something it either<br />means that you should grow the hell up</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.780" end="01:57:10.820" style="s2">and accept the responsibility and quit<br />sniveling around and whining or it means</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.820" end="01:57:14.489" style="s2">that someone actually is oppressing you<br />and and pushing on you too hard and</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.489" end="01:57:20.469" style="s2">bullying you and demeaning you and you<br />have something to say or do that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.469" end="01:57:24.421" style="s2">not saying or doing and no wonder you&#39;re<br />not saying or doing it because you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.421" end="01:57:30.840" style="s2">it can be really dangerous to say things<br />or do them to free yourself from from</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.840" end="01:57:34.260" style="s2">being oppressed you can get in a lot of<br />trouble in the short term for doing it</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.260" end="01:57:38.980" style="s2">so it&#39;s easier just to not say anything<br />sort of day after day in the short term</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.980" end="01:57:43.460" style="s2">you protect yourself but just crushes<br />you and then the the resentment comes up</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.460" end="01:57:47.780" style="s2">and resentment and that can just get so<br />out of hand you know it starts with</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.780" end="01:57:51.910" style="s2">resentment and then it starts it goes to<br />the desire for revenge</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.910" end="01:57:54.660" style="s2">you know because you&#39;ll play nasty<br />little tricks on the person that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.660" end="01:57:56.850" style="s2">opressing you<br />at any chance you&#39;ll talk about them</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.850" end="01:58:00.300" style="s2">behind their back and if they want you<br />to do something you&#39;ll do it badly or</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.300" end="01:58:03.489" style="s2">you&#39;ll do it grudgingly or you&#39;ll do a<br />half rate job and you&#39;ll set up little</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.489" end="01:58:08.750" style="s2">traps and you know so it puts you in a<br />poisonous space and then if that if you</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.750" end="01:58:13.080" style="s2">really start to dwell on that say in<br />your basement for three or four years</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.080" end="01:58:16.530" style="s2">about just exactly how terrible the<br />world is and how that&#39;s focused on you</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.530" end="01:58:20.100" style="s2">and how everyone&#39;s rejected you and how<br />you get to this point where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.100" end="01:58:25.090" style="s2">thinking that you know existence itself<br />is a kind of poisonous endeavor and that</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.090" end="01:58:28.510" style="s2">the best thing for you to do is go out<br />there and do as much you know create as</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.510" end="01:58:33.430" style="s2">much mayhem as you possibly can and if<br />you really get to a dark place you think</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.430" end="01:58:37.340" style="s2">I&#39;m going to create as much mayhem as I<br />possibly can by targeting the most</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.340" end="01:58:41.160" style="s2">innocent thing I can possibly imagine<br />and then you end up shooting kids in</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.160" end="01:58:46.820" style="s2">Connecticut and that&#39;s how you get there<br />and so that&#39;s a bad road man there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.820" end="01:58:51.510" style="s2">dark things down there but you can go<br />there and people do and they go through</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.510" end="01:58:57.430" style="s2">the hole of resentment and so resentment<br />can tell you you&#39;ve got something to say</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.430" end="01:59:02.200" style="s2">you bloody well better say it you&#39;ve got<br />a free yourself from what&#39;s oppressing</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.200" end="01:59:06.680" style="s2">you you have to stand up for that<br />because otherwise you become oppressed</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.680" end="01:59:12.650" style="s2">and then once you&#39;re oppressed that&#39;s<br />just not so good and so like in your</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.650" end="01:59:17.320" style="s2">marriage and your relationships you got<br />to tell people what you&#39;re thinking you</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.320" end="01:59:21.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have to assume you&#39;re right that&#39;s<br />a whole different story because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.120" end="01:59:25.960" style="s2">not cuz you&#39;re you know ignorant and<br />you&#39;re biased and you know so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.960" end="01:59:32.199" style="s2">right but you can stumble towards your<br />this the expression of yourself and then</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.199" end="01:59:35.960" style="s2">you can listen to the other person and<br />hope that they tell you some way that</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.960" end="01:59:39.620" style="s2">you&#39;re stupid that&#39;s useful so you can<br />be a little less stupid in the future</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.620" end="01:59:45.860" style="s2">because that wouldn&#39;t that be good and<br />so you know you go after the unknown you</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.860" end="01:59:50.590" style="s2">don&#39;t protect what you know you already<br />know what you know you go after what you</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.590" end="01:59:54.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know that&#39;s why you have to talk<br />to people you don&#39;t agree with that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.140" end="01:59:57.150" style="s2">where you have to talk to your enemies<br />because they&#39;re gonna tell you things</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.150" end="02:00:00.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you could even listen to<br />them it&#39;s possible they know a thing or</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.050" end="02:00:03.719" style="s2">two you don&#39;t know but people don&#39;t like<br />that you know they just talk to people</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.719" end="02:00:08.570" style="s2">who think the same way and then they<br />just stay stupid and so that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.570" end="02:00:12.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not<br />because if you&#39;re not wise the world</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.360" end="02:00:17.940" style="s2">will wallop you it&#39;ll flatten you and<br />and far more than it has to and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.940" end="02:00:21.350" style="s2">you&#39;ll be better and resentful and<br />you&#39;ll be part of that force that</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.350" end="02:00:26.710" style="s2">Wallops instead of the force that fights<br />against that so well so you go after the</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.710" end="02:00:30.460" style="s2">dragon and that&#39;s what that&#39;s what this<br />guy is doing he&#39;s going after the dragon</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.460" end="02:00:34.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s threatening the society<br />because it always does chaos what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.640" end="02:00:40.500" style="s2">outside of order always threatens order<br />always always and so you have to step</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.500" end="02:00:46.090" style="s2">forward you know in this manner<br />voluntarily and and and go after that</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.090" end="02:00:49.710" style="s2">when it&#39;s still manageable right and<br />that&#39;s the case in your own life too so</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.710" end="02:00:54.010" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;ve had a<br />proclivity to be bullied in the past you</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.010" end="02:00:57.490" style="s2">know and you want to get out of that<br />what you have to do is you have to make</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.490" end="02:01:05.400" style="s2">yourself awake to the to the Maite to<br />the to the what would you say to the to</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.400" end="02:01:09.340" style="s2">the initial stages of that sort of<br />bullying emerging in your life again</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.340" end="02:01:14.219" style="s2">that sort of domination and you have to<br />step forward against it when it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.219" end="02:01:18.040" style="s2">in its developing stages because maybe<br />you can just not have it happen that</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.040" end="02:01:24.010" style="s2">would be better and so you have to be<br />ready to speak what you have to say more</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.010" end="02:01:28.150" style="s2">or less at a moment&#39;s notice you can&#39;t<br />be impulsive about it you know like if</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.150" end="02:01:31.270" style="s2">you and I are talking and you make a<br />mistake or I make a mistake</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.270" end="02:01:34.910" style="s2">even if it&#39;s bothers one or the other of<br />us we should just write it off because</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.910" end="02:01:38.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like one encounter what the hell<br />you you know maybe we had a bad night&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.370" end="02:01:42.700" style="s2">sleep or something you know you gotta be<br />a little forgiving and what if it</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.700" end="02:01:46.560" style="s2">happens twice then you know you should<br />be a little awake and you should</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.560" end="02:01:49.800" style="s2">remember both times and then if it<br />happens a third time it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.800" end="02:01:56.300" style="s2">when you that&#39;s when you act and you say<br />look we talked and this happened and I</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.300" end="02:01:59.719" style="s2">thought yeah whatever and but then you<br />did it again</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.719" end="02:02:03.800" style="s2">and then you just did it again well then<br />the person is basically like what are</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.800" end="02:02:08.760" style="s2">they gonna do you know no well maybe<br />they might argue with you but you kind</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.760" end="02:02:13.290" style="s2">of got them and you&#39;re generally if you<br />just point that out to people just like</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.290" end="02:02:16.489" style="s2">that just that you noticed and they&#39;re<br />willing to say something about it</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.489" end="02:02:20.219" style="s2">they&#39;ll back the hell off they&#39;ll often<br />apologize and sometimes you even make</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.219" end="02:02:22.719" style="s2">them a little more conscious which is<br />like hey that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.719" end="02:02:28.070" style="s2">not such a bad idea that&#39;s what all this<br />means and so this caught this chaos idea</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.070" end="02:02:31.500" style="s2">it&#39;s so for young it was the unconscious<br />right it was the contents of your</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.500" end="02:02:35.390" style="s2">unconscious and so that might be the<br />unknown past the threatening past that</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.390" end="02:02:39.969" style="s2">you have never dealt with there might be<br />the threatening future it might be the</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.969" end="02:02:45.690" style="s2">threatening present but you realized as<br />his as he got older that that the</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.690" end="02:02:50.350" style="s2">unconscious was also the world and you<br />think and so the chaos is not only your</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.350" end="02:02:54.430" style="s2">unconscious mind which meets the unknown<br />but it&#39;s actually the unknown itself</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.430" end="02:02:59.440" style="s2">mingled together you think what the hell<br />does that that&#39;s why the dragon is a</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.440" end="02:03:03.050" style="s2">land creature and an air creature it&#39;s<br />matter and spirit at the same time and</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.050" end="02:03:07.010" style="s2">this sort of gets us into constructivism<br />because the constructivist think that</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.010" end="02:03:10.719" style="s2">basically what happens is that you<br />encounter those elements of the world</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.719" end="02:03:15.810" style="s2">that don&#39;t fit into your theory and out<br />of those new elements you make the world</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.810" end="02:03:18.730" style="s2">through your perceptions and you make<br />yourself by incorporating the</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.730" end="02:03:22.300" style="s2">information and transforming yourself<br />and that&#39;s how Piaget explains the</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.300" end="02:03:26.340" style="s2">development of a child if the child<br />starts out with some reflexes basic</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.340" end="02:03:30.780" style="s2">reflexes and manifesting the reflexes<br />produces results in the world and then</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.780" end="02:03:35.790" style="s2">the child has to reorganize its<br />perceptions to take into account the</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.790" end="02:03:39.001" style="s2">transformations and so then it it gets a<br />little more sophisticated and then it</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.001" end="02:03:43.010" style="s2">can do a few more things and then it can<br />manifest more changes in the world and</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.010" end="02:03:47.430" style="s2">then it martyr it attracts them and<br />modifies its perceptions and actions to</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.430" end="02:03:51.520" style="s2">account for them and it just keeps doing<br />that that&#39;s how the child boots itself</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.520" end="02:03:57.350" style="s2">up like a computer does it&#39;s a very cool<br />idea and so from from the Piaget Gian</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.350" end="02:04:01.179" style="s2">stance so it&#39;s constructive the stance<br />you could think of the world as a latent</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.179" end="02:04:06.010" style="s2">pool of information it&#39;s something like<br />that with a structure obviously that you</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.010" end="02:04:09.500" style="s2">can interact with with your little<br />fingers in your body and your mind and</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.500" end="02:04:14.310" style="s2">your eyes and your mouth and you make<br />changes happen and you track them and</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.310" end="02:04:19.340" style="s2">you model them and you build your skills<br />and as you continue to do that in the</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.340" end="02:04:23.370" style="s2">safety of your house initially under the<br />care of your parents who who fill in</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.370" end="02:04:28.380" style="s2">where you&#39;re ignorant you you you just<br />emerge more and more competent and</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.380" end="02:04:31.949" style="s2">confident and ready to move ahead so<br />that&#39;s that&#39;s how the constructivist</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.949" end="02:04:36.430" style="s2">idea works and so so there&#39;s kind of a<br />chaos idea at the bottom of that which</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.430" end="02:04:41.550" style="s2">is that out of which you emerge and the<br />world emerges at the same time because</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.550" end="02:04:46.620" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t see reality not at<br />all you see almost like an animated</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.620" end="02:04:50.190" style="s2">version of reality you know like when I<br />look at you I just see the front of you</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.190" end="02:04:53.850" style="s2">I just see the outside of you I see you<br />at this height I don&#39;t see any of your</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.850" end="02:04:58.080" style="s2">internal structure I don&#39;t see the the<br />back part of you at all I don&#39;t see your</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.080" end="02:05:03.130" style="s2">family I don&#39;t see your history I don&#39;t<br />see your future you know I just see this</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.130" end="02:05:09.510" style="s2">slice of you you&#39;re so complicated I<br />just see this little like oversimplified</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.510" end="02:05:13.800" style="s2">slice of you right now and I think<br />that&#39;s the reality that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.800" end="02:05:20.520" style="s2">of the reality the way that the Simpsons<br />a Simpsons character is you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.520" end="02:05:24.780" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like you and it&#39;s enough so<br />that you can watch the story but the</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.780" end="02:05:29.489" style="s2">real you man god only knows what that is<br />and that&#39;s a union idea you know that</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.489" end="02:05:34.960" style="s2">the real you is something that radically<br />transcends your perception of yourself</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.960" end="02:05:39.230" style="s2">or your conception of yourself and that<br />you get to that higher you at least in</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.230" end="02:05:45.520" style="s2">part by going into the darkest place and<br />so it&#39;s a hell of an idea man it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.520" end="02:05:50.380" style="s2">really but it&#39;s the old idea of<br />initiation it&#39;s as old as time that idea</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.380" end="02:05:53.730" style="s2">and and there&#39;s something to it and we<br />definitely recreate it in psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.730" end="02:05:58.380" style="s2">like this isn&#39;t an airy theory it&#39;s<br />quite the contrary because what you do</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.380" end="02:06:04.469" style="s2">and as a psychologist always always a<br />behaviorist say that the most the most</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.469" end="02:06:10.030" style="s2">logical clinical type of psychologists a<br />behaviorist is it an initiatory shaman</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.030" end="02:06:13.920" style="s2">even though he or she doesn&#39;t know it<br />because what they do is they say okay</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.920" end="02:06:17.380" style="s2">well let&#39;s take a look at your life like<br />okay you got a bunch of problems and</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.380" end="02:06:21.710" style="s2">they&#39;re like massive dragons and you&#39;re<br />just like you&#39;re not going anywhere with</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.710" end="02:06:26.110" style="s2">those problems you&#39;re just cowering in<br />the corner and what the behavioral</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.110" end="02:06:30.740" style="s2">therapist does is cut them cut that<br />dragon into those little Dwarfs until</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.740" end="02:06:34.400" style="s2">the dwarfs are small enough so that you<br />can really kick the hell out of them and</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.400" end="02:06:37.840" style="s2">so and that by the way they do that is<br />they they take the problem and they</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.840" end="02:06:43.000" style="s2">decompose it into elements that are<br />small enough that you have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.000" end="02:06:47.850" style="s2">probability of mastering them so you<br />take that problem apart into into its</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.850" end="02:06:53.010" style="s2">micro problems careful careful<br />process and then you think okay well how</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.010" end="02:06:57.910" style="s2">could we progress a little bit this week<br />and some of that is to face to practice</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.910" end="02:07:01.780" style="s2">facing things you&#39;re afraid of so like<br />if you&#39;re a graphic and you can&#39;t get on</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.780" end="02:07:05.739" style="s2">an elevator you can&#39;t get on a taxi and<br />you can&#39;t stand up to your husband and</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.739" end="02:07:08.940" style="s2">I&#39;m saying husband because most<br />agoraphobic sar women most of them are</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.940" end="02:07:12.750" style="s2">middle-aged women and most of them were<br />too dependent for most of their life so</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.750" end="02:07:17.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a monster<br />it&#39;s like society husband elevator taxi</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.940" end="02:07:23.330" style="s2">subway it&#39;s a monster and it&#39;s that<br />place you will not go and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.330" end="02:07:27.880" style="s2">you feel this high and everything else<br />looks this big and so and partly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.880" end="02:07:31.340" style="s2">because you&#39;ve run away and when you run<br />away from something it grows and chases</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.340" end="02:07:35.530" style="s2">you which is well it&#39;s exactly what<br />happens to a prey animal man if you go</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.530" end="02:07:40.110" style="s2">in the woods and you find a bear<br />especially a grizzly well you&#39;re in real</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.110" end="02:07:43.940" style="s2">trouble if it&#39;s a grizzly but if it&#39;s a<br />black bear you know generally speaking</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.940" end="02:07:47.040" style="s2">if you stand your ground and make a hell<br />of a lot of noise that thing will leave</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.040" end="02:07:52.640" style="s2">you alone but if you run well what&#39;s it<br />supposed to think it eats things that</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.640" end="02:07:57.550" style="s2">run from it so that&#39;s exactly where that<br />idea came to come from you turn tail and</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.550" end="02:08:01.120" style="s2">run and then the thing that you&#39;re<br />afraid of is really a monster and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.120" end="02:08:05.949" style="s2">gonna like get you and eat you it&#39;s like<br />well that&#39;s true psychologically as well</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.949" end="02:08:10.500" style="s2">and and the same circuits that we use to<br />when we were you know out in the forest</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.500" end="02:08:15.130" style="s2">even even in trees the same circuits<br />that we used to parse up the world then</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.130" end="02:08:21.100" style="s2">into safe territory and place where the<br />predators loom is the way we parse up</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.100" end="02:08:25.210" style="s2">the world now which is safe territory<br />and the place where the predators loom</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.210" end="02:08:30.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just become abstracted way up<br />abstracted way up so but it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.480" end="02:08:35.230" style="s2">damn circuits it&#39;s we know this like the<br />same circuits you used to forage for</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.230" end="02:08:38.070" style="s2">information<br />it&#39;s a dopaminergic circuit is the</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.070" end="02:08:42.910" style="s2">circuit that squirrels use to forage for<br />nuts and you think well why well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.910" end="02:08:47.410" style="s2">because there&#39;s no difference between<br />information and food like you trade</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.410" end="02:08:50.420" style="s2">information for food all the time that&#39;s<br />what you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.420" end="02:08:55.340" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re working on a<br />computer so the idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.340" end="02:09:00.250" style="s2">there&#39;s an equation between information<br />and food it&#39;s like well obviously</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.250" end="02:09:04.580" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s an equation between<br />them so of course you&#39;d use the same</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.580" end="02:09:08.470" style="s2">and I mean the damn squirrel has to<br />remember where the nuts are and so for</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.470" end="02:09:12.691" style="s2">him information is food even so when<br />what happened to human beings is that we</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.691" end="02:09:17.400" style="s2">started thinking hey maybe it&#39;s better<br />to go after information than it is to go</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.400" end="02:09:21.820" style="s2">after food because going after<br />information produces more food than just</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.820" end="02:09:26.090" style="s2">going after food and so that was a<br />pretty damn smart idea so we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.090" end="02:09:30.630" style="s2">doing that so anyways this is what<br />you&#39;re supposed to be doing and so and</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.630" end="02:09:33.980" style="s2">this is what behavior therapists do they<br />decompose your problems what are you</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.980" end="02:09:38.719" style="s2">afraid of well okay you&#39;re afraid of<br />everything well let&#39;s get something</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.719" end="02:09:42.220" style="s2">specific you&#39;re afraid of<br />well I&#39;m afraid of an elevator okay an</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.220" end="02:09:46.670" style="s2">elevator so I have a client she&#39;s afraid<br />of elevators the elevator door open she</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.670" end="02:09:52.489" style="s2">goes that&#39;s a tomb and I thought oh wow<br />I thought it was an elevator but for you</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.489" end="02:09:56.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not a bloody elevator<br />it&#39;s death and so that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.260" end="02:09:59.540" style="s2">afraid of it&#39;s worse than that you&#39;re<br />afraid of being trapped inside there in</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.540" end="02:10:04.310" style="s2">the dark alone alone not knowing if<br />anyone is going to rescue you stuck</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.310" end="02:10:09.239" style="s2">there with your damn imagination<br />freaking out it&#39;s like and if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.239" end="02:10:12.760" style="s2">and then maybe you have a heart attacks<br />because you&#39;re so terrified and you die</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.760" end="02:10:16.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know so that&#39;s the<br />elevator</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.260" end="02:10:19.340" style="s2">well it&#39;s no bloody wonder there no<br />one&#39;s gonna get into something like that</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.340" end="02:10:23.670" style="s2">and then maybe underneath that is your<br />distrust in the mechanisms of society</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.670" end="02:10:29.230" style="s2">right because you know a normal person<br />those weird creatures they&#39;ll get an</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.230" end="02:10:32.290" style="s2">elevator what the hell they don&#39;t care<br />and partly it&#39;s because they have an</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.290" end="02:10:36.980" style="s2">implicit belief even if the thing stops<br />somebody will come along and rescue them</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.980" end="02:10:40.400" style="s2">and usually you don&#39;t even think about<br />it right it&#39;s like no what the hell it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.400" end="02:10:47.160" style="s2">an elevator it&#39;s like the danger is<br />invisible to you and it&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.160" end="02:10:51.699" style="s2">you implicitly trust the structure and<br />so maybe you go into the unconscious</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.699" end="02:10:55.310" style="s2">presuppositions of the person who is<br />terrified of the elevator in the subways</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.310" end="02:10:58.489" style="s2">and you find out they have a real<br />problem with trusting Authority that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.489" end="02:11:01.239" style="s2">partly why they don&#39;t get along with<br />their husband why they&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.239" end="02:11:05.520" style="s2">able to stand up for themselves so then<br />you say okay well you&#39;re afraid of the</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.520" end="02:11:09.420" style="s2">damn elevator but it&#39;s not an elevator<br />it&#39;s a tomb and the tomb is partly you</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.420" end="02:11:14.610" style="s2">and partly it&#39;s partly the elevator and<br />partly your unconscious mind and so well</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.610" end="02:11:17.570" style="s2">what can you handle can you go look at<br />an elevator from</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.570" end="02:11:24.660" style="s2">and feet away it&#39;s like yes okay how<br />about 9 feet away yes 5 feet yes 4 feet</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.660" end="02:11:29.580" style="s2">no okay no problem four and a half feet<br />we&#39;re gonna go from that elevator we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.580" end="02:11:33.280" style="s2">gonna look at the damn thing until<br />you&#39;re bored of it because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.280" end="02:11:37.050" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to you should be bored of<br />the elevator because then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.050" end="02:11:41.800" style="s2">afraid of it obviously it&#39;s like it&#39;s an<br />elevator you just don&#39;t notice it right</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.800" end="02:11:45.530" style="s2">all these things around here that you<br />don&#39;t notice I take you out of here and</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.530" end="02:11:49.730" style="s2">ask you what color the walls are you<br />haven&#39;t got any idea you know yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.730" end="02:11:53.560" style="s2">suspect for most of you there&#39;s not a<br />chance you&#39;d be able to identify the</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.560" end="02:11:57.239" style="s2">gender of the person who&#39;s sitting next<br />to you unless you know them it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.239" end="02:12:01.469" style="s2">you just don&#39;t remember anything and why<br />should you everything works like you</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.469" end="02:12:07.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have to pay attention to it it&#39;s<br />like is that staying up yeah it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.270" end="02:12:14.280" style="s2">up yeah still up still up if it&#39;s like<br />really no you know you get bored of that</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.280" end="02:12:19.310" style="s2">real quick and so then you just ignore<br />it and but the agoraphobic has had that</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.310" end="02:12:24.280" style="s2">veil of ignorance torn away and what<br />they see behind it is mortal threat and</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.280" end="02:12:28.699" style="s2">so that&#39;s really what you&#39;re helping<br />them deal with and so this week there</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.699" end="02:12:30.990" style="s2">are four and a half feet from the<br />elevator next week they&#39;re a foot from</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.990" end="02:12:35.030" style="s2">the elevator and the week after that the<br />horrible gates of Hell open and they</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.030" end="02:12:39.700" style="s2">look inside and they don&#39;t run and so<br />hey they&#39;re tougher than they thought</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.700" end="02:12:42.160" style="s2">they were and that&#39;s what you&#39;re<br />teaching them actually you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.160" end="02:12:45.690" style="s2">teaching them that the world isn&#39;t<br />dangerous because that&#39;s a stupid thing</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.690" end="02:12:50.140" style="s2">to teach someone bloody right the world<br />is dangerous it&#39;s terrifying and</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.140" end="02:12:54.860" style="s2">sometimes people under they realize that<br />and the veil lifts and they see horror</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.860" end="02:12:58.690" style="s2">everywhere they see that and then they<br />think well I&#39;m just a little rabbit I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.690" end="02:13:03.230" style="s2">over here in the corner<br />I can&#39;t move I&#39;m petrified and then they</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.230" end="02:13:08.170" style="s2">can&#39;t move they hide it home they cower<br />at home because everything has become a</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.170" end="02:13:13.780" style="s2">predatory domain and so what you teach<br />them is you&#39;re not as much of a rabbit</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.780" end="02:13:18.530" style="s2">as you think and part of that is that<br />you help them grow some teeth so that</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.530" end="02:13:21.370" style="s2">they can go home and have that fight<br />with their husband that they should have</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.370" end="02:13:25.880" style="s2">had 25 years ago and it happens very<br />frequently with agra phobic clients that</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.880" end="02:13:30.140" style="s2">you get them so they can go on the damn<br />elevator and they can go on the subway</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.140" end="02:13:34.500" style="s2">and they can take a taxi<br />maybe they learn to drive Wow they get</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.500" end="02:13:37.949" style="s2">some autonomy and then they&#39;re a little<br />tougher and so then they can stand up</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.949" end="02:13:41.560" style="s2">from loot for themselves and they go<br />back and like their husband might not be</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.560" end="02:13:45.860" style="s2">very happy with any of this really it<br />depends on what sort of guy he is you</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.860" end="02:13:49.670" style="s2">know if he&#39;s a real tyrant he might be<br />just perfectly happy that he&#39;s married</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.670" end="02:13:53.100" style="s2">to someone who you know was afraid of<br />her own shadow because then she won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.100" end="02:13:58.760" style="s2">ever leave and so that&#39;s a nasty little<br />story and believe me it&#39;s not uncommon</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.760" end="02:14:02.990" style="s2">so she gets tougher by facing what she<br />fears and what she finds out is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.990" end="02:14:06.460" style="s2">a hell of a lot more to her than she<br />thought and that&#39;s really what happens</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.460" end="02:14:09.860" style="s2">when you do behavior therapy with<br />someone who&#39;s agoraphobic it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.860" end="02:14:13.450" style="s2">really that they get less afraid it&#39;s<br />that they get braver that&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.450" end="02:14:21.300" style="s2">different it&#39;s because brave is alert<br />and able to cope naive is there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.300" end="02:14:25.440" style="s2">danger it&#39;s like hell yeah right there&#39;s<br />no danger Jesus what a stupid theory</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.440" end="02:14:30.380" style="s2">that is so anyways that&#39;s what all this<br />is that&#39;s that&#39;s the story man and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.380" end="02:14:37.420" style="s2">a it&#39;s a major story it&#39;s the story of<br />human transformation and growth it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.420" end="02:14:41.510" style="s2">evolution of mankind it&#39;s like it&#39;s a<br />major story and we&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="02:14:41.510" end="02:14:48.900" style="s2">the damn thing for like god only knows<br />how long you know snakes and primates</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.900" end="02:14:54.131" style="s2">co-evolved and our vision are sharp<br />sharp sharp vision seems to have been an</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.131" end="02:15:00.530" style="s2">evolutionary adaptation forced on us by<br />the presence of predatory snakes and</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.530" end="02:15:04.950" style="s2">we&#39;re talking tens of millions of years<br />ago and human beings have unbelievably</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.950" end="02:15:09.360" style="s2">sharp eyesight the only thing that can<br />out see us is birds of prey and they</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.360" end="02:15:13.570" style="s2">have eyes like an eagle a bald eagle has<br />eyes as big as ours and it has two</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.570" end="02:15:18.140" style="s2">phobias that phobia is the central part<br />of the vision so an eagle is all eyes</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.140" end="02:15:22.340" style="s2">man and so but human beings we&#39;re kind<br />of like that too and like half our brain</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.340" end="02:15:27.630" style="s2">is devoted to visual processing we have<br />acute vision in Madagascar where there</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.630" end="02:15:31.090" style="s2">are primates with no predatory snakes<br />there are lemurs they can&#39;t see worth a</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.090" end="02:15:35.670" style="s2">damn and I&#39;m a anthropologist named Lynn<br />Isabelle did a comprehensive study</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.670" end="02:15:39.020" style="s2">worldwide trying to account for the<br />acuity of primate vision and what she</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.020" end="02:15:43.460" style="s2">found was that the more predatory snakes<br />in the vicinity the sharper the eyesight</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.460" end="02:15:47.530" style="s2">of the primates<br />and so we have a really sharp eyesight</p>
<p begin="02:15:47.530" end="02:15:51.200" style="s2">so that means a lot of us were eaten by<br />snakes and none of your ancestors</p>
<p begin="02:15:51.200" end="02:15:54.770" style="s2">fortunately because otherwise you<br />wouldn&#39;t be here but a lot of those who</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.770" end="02:16:01.199" style="s2">fell by the wayside were snake snack and<br />you know when you&#39;re little and living</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.199" end="02:16:05.280" style="s2">in a tree a snake is no damn joke and<br />even now lots of people get bitten by</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.280" end="02:16:09.980" style="s2">snakes and people are phobic of snakes<br />at quite a rate and some of that</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.980" end="02:16:14.030" style="s2">actually seems innate there&#39;s arguments<br />about cycle between psychologists about</p>
<p begin="02:16:14.030" end="02:16:17.730" style="s2">this but even the ones who don&#39;t accept<br />the fact that it&#39;s innate accept the</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.730" end="02:16:22.830" style="s2">fact that you can make someone afraid of<br />a snake by conditioning just like that</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.830" end="02:16:26.239" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make them afraid of a<br />flower by conditioning is really really</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.239" end="02:16:32.399" style="s2">hard so we&#39;re at least at minimum<br />prepared to be afraid of snakes minimum</p>
<p begin="02:16:32.399" end="02:16:36.109" style="s2">and I believe it&#39;s I don&#39;t I believe<br />this fear is actually an 8 although you</p>
<p begin="02:16:36.109" end="02:16:40.929" style="s2">can learn to control it<br />so anyways so that&#39;s that story and like</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.929" end="02:16:46.669" style="s2">what a story man it&#39;s an amazing amazing<br />story you see the the den of the dragon</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.669" end="02:16:50.019" style="s2">here is littered with skulls and bones<br />that&#39;s what that is so either thing is</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.019" end="02:16:54.550" style="s2">no joke it&#39;s like look the hell out and<br />that&#39;s this you know and look it up at</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.550" end="02:16:59.599" style="s2">the top right hand corner there you know<br />that&#39;s from Peter Pan right well you</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.599" end="02:17:03.270" style="s2">remember Captain Hook we talked about<br />him already he&#39;s a tyrant and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.270" end="02:17:07.710" style="s2">tyrant because he&#39;s afraid of death and<br />that&#39;s all he sees in life and so it</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.710" end="02:17:11.489" style="s2">makes him cruel and better and death has<br />already taken part of him right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.489" end="02:17:15.559" style="s2">why he has a hook and that damn<br />crocodiles chasing him tick tick all the</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.559" end="02:17:19.959" style="s2">time and of course that&#39;s the same<br />situation you&#39;re all in man there was a</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.959" end="02:17:23.989" style="s2">crocodile with a clock at its stomach<br />chasing you and it could easily turn you</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.989" end="02:17:28.500" style="s2">into a tyrant it can turn you into a<br />tyrant or a cowering victim or a hero</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.500" end="02:17:33.630" style="s2">those are the options fundamentally so<br />and that&#39;s the Gorgon looking at her own</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.630" end="02:17:37.269" style="s2">the Medusa looking at her own reflection<br />you know mother nature with a head full</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.269" end="02:17:41.080" style="s2">of snakes you know a terrifying vision<br />and that&#39;s actually to some degree an</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.080" end="02:17:45.139" style="s2">archetype that men get confused with<br />women and you know that&#39;s the witchy</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.139" end="02:17:49.079" style="s2">part of women and that&#39;s the part that&#39;s<br />attractive attractive attractive but</p>
<p begin="02:17:49.079" end="02:17:54.489" style="s2">rejecting rejecting rejecting it so many<br />men are petrified by women they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.489" end="02:17:57.529" style="s2">approach them at all they have no idea<br />how to talk to them they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.529" end="02:18:01.449" style="s2">petrified into<br />and that&#39;s way more common than you</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.449" end="02:18:06.169" style="s2">think and so that breeds resentment like<br />you wouldn&#39;t believe you know you hear</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.169" end="02:18:10.399" style="s2">the guy who shot up like Dawson College<br />it&#39;s like what the hell do you think</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.399" end="02:18:16.599" style="s2">motivated him it&#39;s like he that&#39;s what<br />he saw and and it was because well he</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.599" end="02:18:20.920" style="s2">was my opinion is he was too goddamn<br />useless to be attractive to anyone and</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.920" end="02:18:25.389" style="s2">so that&#39;s a hell of a place to be in<br />you know it&#39;s then that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.389" end="02:18:28.920" style="s2">too if you&#39;re chronically rejected by<br />people it&#39;s often because of your own</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.920" end="02:18:33.319" style="s2">insufficiencies you know whether that&#39;s<br />cowardice or lack of social skills or</p>
<p begin="02:18:33.319" end="02:18:37.320" style="s2">whatever it is it&#39;s like you can&#39;t just<br />brush it off as oh well you know no one</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.320" end="02:18:43.479" style="s2">likes me but really I&#39;m okay it&#39;s like<br />no no wrong if everyone rejects you</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.479" end="02:18:46.989" style="s2">there&#39;s probably something wrong and<br />it&#39;s probably deep and difficult and</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.989" end="02:18:52.050" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be horrible to fix and so<br />it&#39;s this isn&#39;t a trivial problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.050" end="02:18:56.729" style="s2">not a trivial problem at all and so you<br />know that&#39;s mother nature for man too</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.729" end="02:19:01.210" style="s2">because from from the sexual selection<br />point of view if they if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.210" end="02:19:09.080" style="s2">selected as a mate Nature has taken them<br />out of the game right and so you know</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.080" end="02:19:12.300" style="s2">people don&#39;t really like that they&#39;re<br />not that happy with that and so but</p>
<p begin="02:19:12.300" end="02:19:15.809" style="s2">getting all whiny about it and then<br />getting violent it&#39;s like that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.809" end="02:19:22.170" style="s2">not all not really very helpful although<br />it&#39;s very common so this is Lyndon</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.170" end="02:19:26.139" style="s2">Isabel an evolutionary arms race between<br />early snakes and mammals triggered the</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.139" end="02:19:30.279" style="s2">development of improved vision and large<br />brain in primates a radical new theory</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.279" end="02:19:35.569" style="s2">suggests these are old representations I<br />really like this one this is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.569" end="02:19:38.479" style="s2">remember<br />I think it&#39;s Greek but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.479" end="02:19:42.319" style="s2">exactly look Greek it might be older<br />it doesn&#39;t matter anyways you see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.319" end="02:19:46.989" style="s2">the same thing same ideas as Graham&#39;s<br />dream right it&#39;s like there&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.989" end="02:19:51.229" style="s2">that exists this this multi headed snake<br />and it&#39;s got this infinity problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.229" end="02:19:55.569" style="s2">everywhere that&#39;s that little circle<br />down there and the problem is well what</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.569" end="02:19:58.899" style="s2">do you do with it you cut off one head<br />seven more growth that&#39;s the eternal</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.899" end="02:20:05.239" style="s2">problem of life and the problem is there<br />there there is the category of problems</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.239" end="02:20:10.209" style="s2">in life and it ain&#39;t going anywhere and<br />so the question is can you deal with the</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.209" end="02:20:15.090" style="s2">whole category at the same time<br />that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s how to be in the</p>
<p begin="02:20:15.090" end="02:20:19.239" style="s2">world is to deal with that category all<br />at the same time and so how did how did</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.239" end="02:20:23.359" style="s2">human beings what did they come up with<br />as a solution and that&#39;s so cool too</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.359" end="02:20:27.040" style="s2">because the solution they come up with<br />not only was the heroism that allows you</p>
<p begin="02:20:27.040" end="02:20:31.060" style="s2">to approach what you&#39;re terrified by and<br />what you find offensive and to learn</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.060" end="02:20:35.619" style="s2">from it but also the idea of sacrifice<br />and and that was played out by cultures</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.619" end="02:20:39.390" style="s2">everywhere including human sacrifice and<br />you think what the hell was up with</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.390" end="02:20:43.470" style="s2">those crazy bastards so long ago they<br />were sacrificing two gods all the time</p>
<p begin="02:20:43.470" end="02:20:48.749" style="s2">what kind of clueless behavior was that<br />burned something and please God burn</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.749" end="02:20:53.479" style="s2">something valuable and please God it&#39;s<br />like what was with them what were they</p>
<p begin="02:20:53.479" end="02:20:58.390" style="s2">thinking well they weren&#39;t stupid those<br />people if they were stupid we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.390" end="02:21:02.100" style="s2">be here they were not stupid and believe<br />me they lived under a lot harsher</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.100" end="02:21:07.250" style="s2">conditions than we do so those were some<br />tough people man you know back then</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.250" end="02:21:11.590" style="s2">you&#39;d last about 15 minutes and so you<br />don&#39;t want to be thinking of your</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.590" end="02:21:15.439" style="s2">ancestors as stupid like there&#39;s no real<br />evidence that we&#39;re much different</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.439" end="02:21:18.430" style="s2">cognitively than we were a hundred and<br />fifty thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.430" end="02:21:25.229" style="s2">so anyways sacrifice what does that mean<br />sacrifice well it&#39;s a discovery man it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.229" end="02:21:29.880" style="s2">the discovery of the future it&#39;s like<br />the future is actually the place where</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.880" end="02:21:33.970" style="s2">there is threat and it&#39;s always gonna be<br />there so what do you do you make</p>
<p begin="02:21:33.970" end="02:21:40.290" style="s2">sacrifices in the present so that the<br />future is better right everyone does</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.290" end="02:21:43.149" style="s2">that that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing right now<br />that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.149" end="02:21:46.260" style="s2">what your parents are doing when they<br />pay money to send you to university they</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.260" end="02:21:52.390" style="s2">think you can bargain with reality it&#39;s<br />amazing you can bargain with reality you</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.390" end="02:21:59.390" style="s2">can forestall gratification now and<br />it&#39;ll pay off it at a place in time that</p>
<p begin="02:21:59.390" end="02:22:04.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even exist yet it&#39;s like who<br />would have believed that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.140" end="02:22:07.569" style="s2">that&#39;s a miracle that that occurs and<br />it&#39;s not like people just figured that</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.569" end="02:22:12.010" style="s2">overnight you know we were chimps for<br />Christ&#39;s sake like how are we gonna come</p>
<p begin="02:22:12.010" end="02:22:15.899" style="s2">up with an idea like that well it&#39;s like<br />well we thought about it for seven</p>
<p begin="02:22:15.899" end="02:22:20.949" style="s2">million years and you know we got to the<br />point where we could kind of act it out</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.949" end="02:22:25.319" style="s2">but we didn&#39;t know what we were doing<br />but it was a merge it&#39;s like a dream it</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.319" end="02:22:28.760" style="s2">was<br />so the terror of the future is a dream</p>
<p begin="02:22:28.760" end="02:22:32.850" style="s2">and the solution to the terror the dream<br />of the terror of the future is another</p>
<p begin="02:22:32.850" end="02:22:38.471" style="s2">dream and and it comes out in mythology<br />and in fantasy and in drama where you</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.471" end="02:22:43.529" style="s2">act out the sacrifice and then it&#39;s a<br />step on the way to full understanding so</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.529" end="02:22:47.450" style="s2">we can say sacrifice now instead of<br />doing it you know although we still do</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.450" end="02:22:53.200" style="s2">it it&#39;s just not concretize like it used<br />to be we do it abstractly and we all</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.200" end="02:22:57.819" style="s2">have faith that it will work you know<br />and we also set up our society so that</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.819" end="02:23:03.949" style="s2">it&#39;ll work and one thing about you know<br />I&#39;m not a fan of moral relativism for a</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.949" end="02:23:07.619" style="s2">variety of reasons partly because I<br />think it&#39;s an it&#39;s an extreme form of</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.619" end="02:23:13.699" style="s2">cowardice but anyways apart from that no<br />no no no there&#39;s minimal ways that you</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.699" end="02:23:18.439" style="s2">can set up a society that will work and<br />so one of them is is that the society</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.439" end="02:23:23.489" style="s2">has to be set up so that your sacrifices<br />will pay off or you won&#39;t work and then</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.489" end="02:23:27.659" style="s2">the society will die and so it has to<br />make promises people have to make</p>
<p begin="02:23:27.659" end="02:23:32.789" style="s2">promises to one another and that&#39;s what<br />money is money is a promise that your</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.789" end="02:23:36.689" style="s2">sacrifice will pay off in the future<br />that&#39;s what money is and so if the</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.689" end="02:23:42.890" style="s2">society is stable you can store up your<br />work right now you can sacrifice your</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.890" end="02:23:48.689" style="s2">impulses and you can work and you can<br />store up credit for the future and then</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.689" end="02:23:52.420" style="s2">you can make the future a better place<br />but Society has to be stable enough to</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.420" end="02:23:57.930" style="s2">allow for that hyperinflation will do<br />you in so the promise that&#39;s implicit in</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.930" end="02:24:01.619" style="s2">the currency is the promise that what<br />you&#39;re doing now will pay off in the</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.619" end="02:24:06.189" style="s2">future and if people don&#39;t have that<br />promise then well we know what they do</p>
<p begin="02:24:06.189" end="02:24:11.220" style="s2">because in in gangs for example and say<br />gangs in North America the time horizon</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.220" end="02:24:14.069" style="s2">of the gang members shrinks rapidly<br />because they don&#39;t really expect to be</p>
<p begin="02:24:14.069" end="02:24:18.520" style="s2">alive at much past 21 and so they get<br />really impulsive and violent and like</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.520" end="02:24:23.590" style="s2">why the hell not that&#39;s that&#39;s what you<br />do when when the future doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.590" end="02:24:27.919" style="s2">when it&#39;s not real you you default back<br />to living in the moment and you take</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.919" end="02:24:31.300" style="s2">what you can get right now and no wonder<br />because you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.300" end="02:24:36.199" style="s2">be around you know in a year and you get<br />whatever you can well you can bloody</p>
<p begin="02:24:36.199" end="02:24:39.660" style="s2">well get it and that&#39;s like anarchy that<br />state and so</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.660" end="02:24:42.109" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to live and some people<br />like to live in that state because</p>
<p begin="02:24:42.109" end="02:24:45.979" style="s2">they&#39;re really wired for that you know<br />and so they&#39;re they&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="02:24:45.979" end="02:24:50.649" style="s2">comfortable in those conditions there<br />they&#39;re kind of like warrior types I</p>
<p begin="02:24:50.649" end="02:24:56.140" style="s2">would say in some sense but you know for<br />most people that&#39;s just where that</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.140" end="02:25:03.770" style="s2">stress will just do you in you know the<br />stress of a life like that so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.770" end="02:25:07.209" style="s2">pretty horrible picture the one on the<br />right I think and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:25:07.209" end="02:25:10.789" style="s2">creepy picture and don&#39;t you think<br />doesn&#39;t it seems like a creepy picture</p>
<p begin="02:25:10.789" end="02:25:15.760" style="s2">to me yeah and so that&#39;s quetzel a codel<br />if I remember correctly who&#39;s me who is</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.760" end="02:25:21.310" style="s2">an Aztec dragon God and that&#39;s the Eye<br />of Horus by oh by the way this little</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.310" end="02:25:25.189" style="s2">thing here and that see the Egyptians<br />they worship the eye</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.189" end="02:25:30.319" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s cool because well why<br />did they worship the eye well wake the</p>
<p begin="02:25:30.319" end="02:25:33.989" style="s2">hell up and look at the world that&#39;s<br />your salvation to do that pay bloody</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.989" end="02:25:37.920" style="s2">attention especially to the things you<br />don&#39;t want to pay attention to and use</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.920" end="02:25:43.510" style="s2">your vision have some vision and you can<br />use your vision to see into the future</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.510" end="02:25:48.080" style="s2">and that is your that&#39;s your Redemption<br />and the Egyptians they didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="02:25:48.080" end="02:25:52.069" style="s2">to say that but they knew how to<br />represent it and that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.069" end="02:25:56.579" style="s2">represented it like the pupil on that is<br />completely open completely dilated and</p>
<p begin="02:25:56.579" end="02:26:00.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a God as far as the Egyptians<br />we&#39;re concerned it&#39;s Horus and I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="02:26:00.060" end="02:26:04.569" style="s2">you Horus a story at some point so early<br />primates developed a better eye for</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.569" end="02:26:08.090" style="s2">color detail and movement and the<br />ability to see in three dimensions</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.090" end="02:26:11.109" style="s2">traits that are important for detecting<br />threats at close range humans are</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.109" end="02:26:15.560" style="s2">descended from these same primates all<br />right</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.560" end="02:26:21.090" style="s2">so now the initiation when you go into<br />psychotherapy or when you make any</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.090" end="02:26:26.449" style="s2">supreme moral effort which is roughly<br />the same thing you have to confront that</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.449" end="02:26:31.419" style="s2">which you do not know now I mentioned<br />the called prima cosmogonic chaos and</p>
<p begin="02:26:31.419" end="02:26:34.739" style="s2">the idea that at the end of Jung&#39;s life<br />he sort of thought of the unconscious</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.739" end="02:26:38.159" style="s2">and the world as the same and you think<br />what the hell does that mean but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.159" end="02:26:42.130" style="s2">what it means so let&#39;s say you&#39;re in a<br />long-term intimate relationship and you</p>
<p begin="02:26:42.130" end="02:26:48.739" style="s2">get betrayed okay so what is it that you<br />see when you see your partner at the</p>
<p begin="02:26:48.739" end="02:26:53.239" style="s2">moment you know of the betrayal well you<br />see the pre</p>
<p begin="02:26:53.239" end="02:26:59.930" style="s2">maganda chaos and here&#39;s why well it<br />rattles your unconscious up because you</p>
<p begin="02:26:59.930" end="02:27:03.950" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything anymore you don&#39;t<br />know what the past was right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:27:03.950" end="02:27:07.310" style="s2">know what it was and it&#39;s supposed to be<br />real and all of a sudden you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.310" end="02:27:11.919" style="s2">what it was and so you come up with wild<br />ideas about what it might have been and</p>
<p begin="02:27:11.919" end="02:27:15.300" style="s2">what it represented and then you don&#39;t<br />know what the future is gonna be anymore</p>
<p begin="02:27:15.300" end="02:27:18.529" style="s2">so then your fantasy fills that space<br />and you don&#39;t know who the hell you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.529" end="02:27:22.560" style="s2">looking at that&#39;s for sure and you don&#39;t<br />know much about human beings and you</p>
<p begin="02:27:22.560" end="02:27:25.130" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t know anything about<br />yourself</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.130" end="02:27:29.499" style="s2">and so all of a sudden not only is<br />everything in chaos inside your mind but</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.499" end="02:27:33.630" style="s2">everything is in chaos<br />in your world and it actually is and</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.630" end="02:27:36.699" style="s2">there&#39;s no telling the difference<br />between those two things you know and so</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.699" end="02:27:41.560" style="s2">then they you&#39;re just shattered and so<br />then you go talk to a therapist for like</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.560" end="02:27:47.260" style="s2">two years and you think what happened<br />what was the reality and the reality is</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.260" end="02:27:51.200" style="s2">because who knows what the reality was<br />like but as far as you&#39;re concerned the</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.200" end="02:27:56.470" style="s2">reality is I better represent this<br />properly in my head I better figure out</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.470" end="02:28:01.669" style="s2">who I was who that person was what we<br />did together and what it meant because I</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.669" end="02:28:07.039" style="s2">do not want this to happen again and so<br />you&#39;re healed</p>
<p begin="02:28:07.039" end="02:28:11.800" style="s2">when you get to the point where you&#39;ve<br />grasped the bloody moral of the story</p>
<p begin="02:28:11.800" end="02:28:16.020" style="s2">what went wrong and how can I not have<br />that happen again</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.020" end="02:28:20.020" style="s2">because that&#39;s the purpose of learning<br />right that&#39;s the purpose of memory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.020" end="02:28:26.449" style="s2">to prepare you for the future and so you<br />have to pull out of that massive chaos a</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.449" end="02:28:31.340" style="s2">functional representation that increases<br />your wisdom so that you&#39;re not this</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.340" end="02:28:35.479" style="s2">naive target the next time you enter<br />into a relationship so at least you can</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.479" end="02:28:40.350" style="s2">have another relationship without being<br />so traumatized that you know you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.350" end="02:28:45.149" style="s2">done and you know it can take people<br />years to talk that through because this</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.149" end="02:28:49.779" style="s2">landscape of potential opens up when<br />when they&#39;re betrayed it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.779" end="02:28:55.029" style="s2">anything could have been the truth well<br />you to sort through that you have to</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.029" end="02:28:59.709" style="s2">wander through all that mess and it&#39;s<br />really painful and and emotional as well</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.709" end="02:29:04.729" style="s2">you have to sort through all that mess<br />to come out with the new you right there</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.729" end="02:29:10.439" style="s2">renewed you and so<br />well this is a representation of it this</p>
<p begin="02:29:10.439" end="02:29:14.930" style="s2">is how people act this out by but<br />whatever method he may have been</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.930" end="02:29:19.569" style="s2">designated the shaman is recognized as<br />such as only after having received two</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.569" end="02:29:24.229" style="s2">methods of instruction the first is<br />ecstatic dreams trances and visions the</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.229" end="02:29:27.939" style="s2">second is traditional shamanic<br />techniques names and functions of the</p>
<p begin="02:29:27.939" end="02:29:32.300" style="s2">spirit mythology and genealogy of the<br />clan and the secret language well one of</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.300" end="02:29:36.329" style="s2">the things that happens this happens to<br />you even if if you encounter something</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.329" end="02:29:41.020" style="s2">terrible like a betrayal what happens is<br />that you have to take a journey into the</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.020" end="02:29:46.551" style="s2">domain of morality essentially which is<br />how did I act and how did that person to</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.551" end="02:29:49.999" style="s2">act and how should have they acted and<br />how should have I acted and so and</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.999" end="02:29:54.060" style="s2">that&#39;s part of your cultural structure<br />and so that&#39;s the idea of rescuing the</p>
<p begin="02:29:54.060" end="02:29:57.760" style="s2">dead farther from the depths right and<br />that&#39;s what we&#39;ll show you some examples</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.760" end="02:30:05.619" style="s2">of that so this is a critical issue with<br />regards to the shamanic transformation</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.619" end="02:30:10.479" style="s2">is that people go through these terrible<br />terrible experiences often drug-induced</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.479" end="02:30:13.739" style="s2">by the way with regards to the shaman<br />they usually use psychedelic chemicals</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.739" end="02:30:17.300" style="s2">of one form another often mushrooms but<br />but they&#39;ve come up with some very</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.300" end="02:30:22.250" style="s2">strange concoctions like ayahuasca down<br />in the Amazon and ayahuasca is an</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.250" end="02:30:27.020" style="s2">amazing substance it&#39;s made out of the<br />bark of one thing and another plant</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.020" end="02:30:30.859" style="s2">whose name I don&#39;t remember that hardly<br />even grow in the same place and that</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.859" end="02:30:35.899" style="s2">have to be cooked together in a special<br />way and no one has any idea how the damn</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.899" end="02:30:39.680" style="s2">Amazonians figured that out it looks<br />impossible and if you ask them they say</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.680" end="02:30:43.540" style="s2">well the plants told us how to do it<br />which you know Western people don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.540" end="02:30:47.529" style="s2">very helpful but the shamans are<br />perfectly helped happy with that that</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.529" end="02:30:51.310" style="s2">description in ayahuasca takes them<br />apart and it does that in part because</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.310" end="02:30:56.950" style="s2">its effects the serotonergic system very<br />very powerfully like all psychedelics do</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.950" end="02:31:02.489" style="s2">and it transports them to another world<br />and that&#39;s how they interpret it and and</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.489" end="02:31:07.010" style="s2">and and what we know about psychedelics<br />you could put in a thimble and then</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.010" end="02:31:11.189" style="s2">throw the thimble away we know nothing<br />about psychedelics there&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="02:31:11.189" end="02:31:15.770" style="s2">experiments going on at Johns Hopkins<br />for example with psilocybin which is</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.770" end="02:31:19.800" style="s2">part of this active chemical in magic<br />mushrooms same structure basically as</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.800" end="02:31:22.899" style="s2">LSD and mescaline<br />all the real psychedelics have basically</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.899" end="02:31:27.069" style="s2">the same structure except the one that&#39;s<br />derived from Amanita muscaria which is</p>
<p begin="02:31:27.069" end="02:31:30.749" style="s2">called muscarinic acid and it&#39;s a it&#39;s<br />its own weird thing that no one knows</p>
<p begin="02:31:30.749" end="02:31:34.579" style="s2">anything about anyways they have<br />profound neuro chemical effects in very</p>
<p begin="02:31:34.579" end="02:31:40.789" style="s2">small doses and the research group at<br />Johns Hopkins has given psilocybin to</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.789" end="02:31:43.589" style="s2">research subjects<br />you know purified psilocybin because</p>
<p begin="02:31:43.589" end="02:31:47.239" style="s2">they started the new experimentation<br />with psychedelics and that&#39;s been banned</p>
<p begin="02:31:47.239" end="02:31:50.470" style="s2">for like 40 years<br />because psychedelics were so terrifying</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.470" end="02:31:53.999" style="s2">to our culture that we just put them<br />away it&#39;s like oh no we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.999" end="02:31:58.439" style="s2">there and so even from a research<br />perspective and even though some of the</p>
<p begin="02:31:58.439" end="02:32:02.529" style="s2">psychedelics look very promising for the<br />treatment of disorders like alcoholism</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.529" end="02:32:06.039" style="s2">they recently used psilocybin to help<br />people stop smoking down at Johns</p>
<p begin="02:32:06.039" end="02:32:10.270" style="s2">Hopkins and I think they had an 80%<br />success rate which is just like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:32:10.270" end="02:32:14.279" style="s2">just absolutely mind-boggling<br />and so but if you give people psilocybin</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.279" end="02:32:17.970" style="s2">and they have a mystical experience<br />which is very common among people who</p>
<p begin="02:32:17.970" end="02:32:23.319" style="s2">take these sorts of chemicals then their<br />personality transforms permanently such</p>
<p begin="02:32:23.319" end="02:32:27.859" style="s2">that one year later their one standard<br />deviation higher in openness and</p>
<p begin="02:32:27.859" end="02:32:31.609" style="s2">openness is the creativity dimension and<br />that seems to be a permanent</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.609" end="02:32:35.290" style="s2">transformation so that&#39;s really<br />remarkable and about 80 percent of the</p>
<p begin="02:32:35.290" end="02:32:39.979" style="s2">people who undergo the Johns Hopkins<br />experiments report that the experience</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.979" end="02:32:43.720" style="s2">is like one of the two or three most<br />important things they&#39;ve ever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.720" end="02:32:48.680" style="s2">never ever happened to them and so well<br />that&#39;s that&#39;s something you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:32:48.680" end="02:32:52.510" style="s2">like and then there&#39;s this guy named<br />Rick Strassman down at I think he was at</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.510" end="02:32:56.369" style="s2">the University of Texas and he did<br />experimentation with DMT and DMT</p>
<p begin="02:32:56.369" end="02:33:01.729" style="s2">dimethyltryptamine I remember I remember<br />correctly is the active ingredient in</p>
<p begin="02:33:01.729" end="02:33:05.350" style="s2">ayahuasca and you produce it in your<br />brain and it&#39;s in plants it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="02:33:05.350" end="02:33:10.050" style="s2">very common chemical but DMT is a weird<br />hallucinogen because it has an</p>
<p begin="02:33:10.050" end="02:33:14.359" style="s2">extraordinarily short mechanism of<br />action it&#39;s like and people who take it</p>
<p begin="02:33:14.359" end="02:33:19.609" style="s2">report that they&#39;re blasted out of their<br />body like out of a cannon and then they</p>
<p begin="02:33:19.609" end="02:33:25.850" style="s2">go out somewhere and encounter beings of<br />various sorts and then ten minutes later</p>
<p begin="02:33:25.850" end="02:33:29.899" style="s2">they&#39;re back and virtually everyone<br />reports that which is really strange and</p>
<p begin="02:33:29.899" end="02:33:34.669" style="s2">and so strassman was giving people DMT<br />intravenously so that the trip</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.669" end="02:33:39.619" style="s2">would last longer he this was all all<br />you know nih-funded</p>
<p begin="02:33:39.619" end="02:33:42.419" style="s2">experimentation all cleared with the<br />relevant ethics boards all conducted</p>
<p begin="02:33:42.419" end="02:33:46.630" style="s2">within the last 10 years and he<br />basically quit doing it because he was a</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.630" end="02:33:50.020" style="s2">pretty straight scientist you know he<br />was measuring heart rate and pulse and</p>
<p begin="02:33:50.020" end="02:33:53.749" style="s2">all that sort of thing trying to look at<br />the physiology and then the people he</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.749" end="02:33:57.709" style="s2">was giving these chemicals to kept<br />coming back and telling him these these</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.709" end="02:34:04.659" style="s2">crazy stories and well it just it was<br />too much for him you know and no wonder</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.659" end="02:34:07.680" style="s2">you know cuz they all said the same<br />thing and he&#39;d say well that was a dream</p>
<p begin="02:34:07.680" end="02:34:10.399" style="s2">and they&#39;d say no and it was the most<br />real thing that ever happened to me and</p>
<p begin="02:34:10.399" end="02:34:14.050" style="s2">he&#39;d say well you know it&#39;s an<br />archetypal experience and they&#39;d say no</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.050" end="02:34:17.670" style="s2">no no that was no archetypal experience<br />I went somewhere else and I saw things</p>
<p begin="02:34:17.670" end="02:34:21.489" style="s2">and I&#39;m back and like I don&#39;t care what<br />you think and like who the hell knows</p>
<p begin="02:34:21.489" end="02:34:25.279" style="s2">right because it&#39;s all subjective but<br />but the weird thing about it is that</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.279" end="02:34:29.350" style="s2">everyone&#39;s reporting the same thing how<br />the hell do you account for that and</p>
<p begin="02:34:29.350" end="02:34:32.529" style="s2">then the shaman you know when they take<br />these psychedelic chemicals they</p>
<p begin="02:34:32.529" end="02:34:36.630" style="s2">basically say the same thing they say<br />well first of all it more or less killed</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.630" end="02:34:43.959" style="s2">me that&#39;s this you know i dissolved two<br />skeleton and then I climbed the tree</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.959" end="02:34:47.760" style="s2">that unites heaven and earth and I went<br />into the realm of the gods and they gave</p>
<p begin="02:34:47.760" end="02:34:52.380" style="s2">me some information and I&#39;m back it&#39;s<br />like okay well you know we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="02:34:52.380" end="02:34:56.090" style="s2">know what to make of that and we and<br />certainly that&#39;s what Elia describes</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.090" end="02:35:00.180" style="s2">when he describes the shamanic the<br />shamanic procession not the shamanic</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.180" end="02:35:04.270" style="s2">initiation and you know there&#39;s<br />dissolution to a skeleton first and then</p>
<p begin="02:35:04.270" end="02:35:08.630" style="s2">like a death the symbolic death or<br />experienced as an actual death and then</p>
<p begin="02:35:08.630" end="02:35:13.850" style="s2">bang up into the realm of the gods and<br />then they come back there&#39;s a very old</p>
<p begin="02:35:13.850" end="02:35:17.479" style="s2">idea and that&#39;s a medieval<br />representation of the tunnel that people</p>
<p begin="02:35:17.479" end="02:35:21.260" style="s2">travel through at the end of their life<br />to you know to find the light which is a</p>
<p begin="02:35:21.260" end="02:35:25.159" style="s2">very common near-death experience report<br />and people don&#39;t have any idea what the</p>
<p begin="02:35:25.159" end="02:35:29.390" style="s2">hell to do with those reports except say<br />well it&#39;s the paroxysm zuv the dying</p>
<p begin="02:35:29.390" end="02:35:34.279" style="s2">brain which you&#39;d expect to be a hell of<br />a lot more random in my opinion and the</p>
<p begin="02:35:34.279" end="02:35:39.529" style="s2">idea is there&#39;s a rebirth after that and<br />you know here this is the Scandinavian</p>
<p begin="02:35:39.529" end="02:35:43.919" style="s2">representation of that tree that unites<br />earth with heaven and so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:35:43.919" end="02:35:48.200" style="s2">Scandinavian representation it has a<br />snake snakes down here eating it and</p>
<p begin="02:35:48.200" end="02:35:53.649" style="s2">and that&#39;s the amazonian representation<br />it&#39;s like how the hell he account for</p>
<p begin="02:35:53.649" end="02:35:58.550" style="s2">that I mean those those pictures are so<br />similar that it&#39;s just it&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="02:35:58.550" end="02:36:05.260" style="s2">belief well you know we lived in trees<br />for a long time a long long long long</p>
<p begin="02:36:05.260" end="02:36:10.029" style="s2">time millions of years and there were<br />lots of snakes around them and so the</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.029" end="02:36:14.189" style="s2">idea that reality is a tree that&#39;s<br />surrounded by a snake is that&#39;s in us</p>
<p begin="02:36:14.189" end="02:36:18.069" style="s2">man it&#39;s down there it&#39;s deep and<br />there&#39;s something about it that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.069" end="02:36:23.029" style="s2">now not true like we normally think of<br />truth a truth true in an entirely</p>
<p begin="02:36:23.029" end="02:36:28.449" style="s2">different manner so and all that&#39;s<br />pretty damn strange we&#39;ll stop with this</p>
<p begin="02:36:28.449" end="02:36:32.899" style="s2">my son drew this when he was seven years<br />old blew me away man I thought it was so</p>
<p begin="02:36:32.899" end="02:36:37.449" style="s2">cool so I had it laminated and so here<br />is what it is on the right hand side</p>
<p begin="02:36:37.449" end="02:36:42.810" style="s2">that&#39;s ordered it&#39;s like the yin-yang<br />thing that&#39;s order left-side chaos right</p>
<p begin="02:36:42.810" end="02:36:47.689" style="s2">and those are all mushroom houses which<br />I thought was amazing and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:36:47.689" end="02:36:51.630" style="s2">this river that runs right down the<br />middle like the line for order and chaos</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.630" end="02:36:55.489" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this tree that goes up<br />to heaven and that&#39;s heaven up there</p>
<p begin="02:36:55.489" end="02:36:58.949" style="s2">it&#39;s like there st. Peter there&#39;s the<br />pearly gates there&#39;s the clouds it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:36:58.949" end="02:37:03.789" style="s2">like it&#39;s he never went to church you<br />know it&#39;s like what the hell and then</p>
<p begin="02:37:03.789" end="02:37:08.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bug there that goes up<br />and down from heaven to earth and that</p>
<p begin="02:37:08.369" end="02:37:13.199" style="s2">was him and I thought he had a very<br />organized psyche that kid he was a very</p>
<p begin="02:37:13.199" end="02:37:17.659" style="s2">very stable kid and still is and I he<br />drew that and I thought Jesus that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:37:17.659" end="02:37:22.189" style="s2">just bloody will unbelievable and I<br />still think that when I look at it and</p>
<p begin="02:37:22.189" end="02:37:26.939" style="s2">that&#39;s a great example of an archetype<br />and so we&#39;ll see you Tuesday</p>
<p begin="02:37:26.939" end="02:37:27.119" style="s2">you</p>
