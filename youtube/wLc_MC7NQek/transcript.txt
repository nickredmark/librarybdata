[Music]all right so I suggested to you last
class that human beings world as a placeof action through the lens of their
social cognitive biological substructure and I made that argument on
the basis of the supposition that ourprimary environment was actually other
people and I mentioned to you I believethat those other people are arranged in
hierarchies of influence and authorityor power or dominance which is often how
its construed and that the dominancehierarchy as a structure is at least 300
million years oldwhich makes it older than trees and it's
for that reason that you share the sameneural biology to govern your
observations of your position in thehierarchy as lobsters do which is a
remarkable fact you know it's aremarkable that the lobster uses
serotonin as the mechanism to adjudicateits status position and that modifying
the serotonin function in the lobstercan produce changes in its behavior can
can / help the logs to overcome defeatfor example which is very much
equivalent to what happens to a humanbeing when they take antidepressants you
know it's it's it's a good example ofthe conservation of biological structure
by evolution and another a goodillustration of the continuity of life
on Earth it's really amazing but theother thing it is a testament to is the
ancient nature of the social structurenow we tend to think of the social
structure as something other than natureright because society is I suppose
mythologically opposed it's opposed in anarrative way cultures opposed to nature
it's the town in the forest but the townhas been around a long time so to speak
and the structure of the town is alsopart of nature in that the dominance
hierarchy is part ofand because it's so ancient you have to
consider it as part of the mechanismthat has played the role of selection in
the process of natural selection and soroughly seem what seems to happen is
that there is a plethora of dominancehierarchies especially in complex human
communities and many of them aremasculine in structure in that their
dominance are keys that primarily mencompete in or that has been the
historical norm and that some men riseto the top based on whatever the
dominance hierarchy is based on and theymake their preferential mates and it's a
good strategy for women to engage inbecause why and many sorts of female
animals do precisely this is they letthe male's battle it out and then pick
from the top and or often the dominantmales there's no choice on the part of
the females it's the dominant males justchasing away the subordinate males but
with humans it's usually the case thatthe females have the opportunity to do
at least some choosing and so we have ifyou think about that what that implies
is that we have evolved to climb updominance hierarchies and then I would
say it's not exactly that even becausethere are many different dominance
hierarchies and so the skills that youmight use to climb up one might not be
necessarily the same skills that youwould use to climb up another and so
then I would say what we have allevolved for instead and I'm still
speaking mostly on the masculine edge ofthings historically speaking is the
ability to climb up the set of allpossible dominance hierarchies right and
that's that's a whole different ideait's like the averaged hierarchy across
vast spans of time and I think it's forthat reason that we among others that we
evolve general intelligence becausegeneral intelligence is a general
problem-solving mechanism and it seemsto be situation in depend
so to speak and of course there's beenan arms race for the development of
intelligence between men and womenbecause each gender has to keep up with
the other and women have their owndominance hierarchies there's certainly
no doubt about thatand of course now men and women more
increasingly compete within the samehierarchies and we don't exactly know
how to sort that out yet because it's anextraordinarily new phenomena but in any
case because of the the permanence ofthe dominance hierarchy it has come to
be represented in fundamental narrativesbecause human beings and this is
something that we share everywhere it'sthe thing the Wall Street bankers shares
with with the kalahari Kung Bushmen whoare among the genetically speaking they
seem to be very close to what theoriginal most original human beings were
like in Africa before the Diaspora aboutfifty thousand years ago but you know
both of those peopledespite their vast differences live in
communities that have a hierarchicalstructure that are composed of
individuals that are embedded in anatural world you know the world outside
of the dominant Sarki and so that's thestandard human environment I would say
and so stories that rely on therepresentations of those environments
and their interactions are what youmight describe as universal stories and
that's why people can understand themand I would say further and this is
drawing substantially on say derivationof the work of Carl Jung because I think
he delved into this more deeply thananyone else so a lot of this stuff is
quite Union in its in its origins we thecommonality between human beings so you
know you have to have commonalities inorder to communicate right axiomatic
commonalities because otherwise you haveto explain everything and so there's
many things that human beings don't haveto explain to one another we don't have
to explain anger we dohave to explain jealousy we don't have
to explain fear we don't have to explainpain we don't have to explain joy we
don't have to explain love etc those arebuilt into us and so there are
predicates of being human and you couldsay that those human predicates and the
standard human environment producestandard narratives and then you could
say even further and this is more of aleap I would say is that those who act
out the role of the victor in thosestandard narratives are precisely the
people who attain victory in life and Iwould say biologically defined in that
they make more attractive partners butalso I believe that there's an alignment
between human well-being which is a veryweak word and participation in these
meta narratives that drive successbecause well do you want to be a failure
or a success well you know it's hard tobe a success you have to adopt a lot of
responsibility and so you might bewilling to take your chances as a
failure but I can't exactly I'm notgoing to make the presumption that
that's going to put you in a situationother than one where you experienced a
lot of frustration anger disappointmentdepression pain and anxiety at the
bottom of the heap and so generallythat's not what people are aiming for
although under certain circumstances ifpeople don't like responsibility and are
willing to take their chances they mighttake the irresponsibility and it's
apparent freedoms over the necessity ofthinking things through the medium and
long run anyways we stop here Isuggested to you that one of the primary
narrative representations was the knownor culture or order I think those or the
explored territory or the dominance arcI think those things are basically
interchangeable from from arepresentational perspective and you
know in the movie The Lion King that'srepresented by Pride Rock which is the
central place of orientation founded onRaw
which is the sort of thing that peopleembed their memories in that's why we
make sculptures and gravestones and thatsort of things rock stands for permanent
and to have rock under your feet as tobe on a solid foundation and that's a
pyramid in some sense in that movie andthe pyramid has topped by you know the
king and queen and they're theiroffspring so that's that's the divine
couple that's one way of thinking aboutit and Simba of course is the newborn
hero and you know you extend that eventhough it's lions and drawings of lions
at that and animals are acting it outit's completely irrelevant to you that
those characters happen to be animatedand that what you're watching is a
fiction so and I would say to you withregards to fiction you know you might
say well is fiction true or not and theanswer to that is yes and no it's not
true in that the events portrayed infiction occurred in the world they
didn't but they're fiction is true thesame way numbers are true I would say
like you know if you have one apple andone orange and one banana the common
analogy between all of those three isone and you might say well is one as
real as one fruit is the abstraction oneas real as one fruit and I would say it
depends on what you mean by real butrepresenting things mathematically and
abstractly gives you incredible powerand you could make the case that the
abstraction is actually more real thanthe phenomena that it represents and
certainly mathematicians would make thatcase they would say that mathematics is
in some sense more real than thephenomenal world and you know you don't
have to believe that mostly it's amatter of choice in some sense but you
can't deny the fact that an abstractionhas enough reality so that if you're
proficient in using it you can reallyyou can change the world and in and in
insanely powerful ways you know I meanall the computational equipment you
people are using or dependingon the abstractions one and zero
essentially and I mean look at whatemerges from that and so I would say
with regards to fiction if you takesomeone like Dostoyevsky oh I think it's
a favorite of mine by the way I wouldhighly recommend that you read all five
of his great novels because they areunparalleled in their psychological
depth and so if you're interested inpsychology Dostoyevsky's the person for
youTolstoy is more of a sociologist but
Dostoyevsky man he gets right down intothe bottom of the questions and messes
around transformative reading anywaysDostoyevsky's characters this character
named her skull in the Cobb is acharacter in crime and punishment and
Raskolnikov is a materialist rationalistI would say which was a rather new type
of person back in the 1880s and he wassort of taken by the idea that God was
dead and took and convinced himself thatthe only reason that he that anyone
acted in a moral way in a traditionalway was because of cowardice they were
unable to remove from them therestrictions of mere convention and act
in the manner of someone who rose abovethe norm and so he's tortured by these
ideas he's half starving he's a lawstudent he doesn't have enough to eat he
doesn't have much money and so you knowhe's not thinking all that clearly
either and he's got a lot of familyproblems his mother's sick and she can't
spend him send a much money and hissister is planning to engage in a
marriage that's loveless to someonewho's rather tyrannical who he hopes
will provide the family with enoughmoney so that he can continue in law
school and they write him brave letterstelling him that she's very much in love
with this guy but he is smart enough toread between the lines and realizes that
his sister is just planning toprostitute herself in you know in an
altruistic manner he's not very happywith that and then at the same time as
all this is happening he becomes awareof this pawnbroker who he's you know
pawning his last possessions to andshe's a horrible
person and not only by his estimationshe pawns a lot of things for the
neighborhood and people really don'tlike her she's grasping and cruel and
deceitful and and resentful and like andshe has this niece who's not very bright
intellectually impaired whom shebasically treats as a slave and beats
all the time and so Raskolnikov you knowinvolved in this mess and half starved
and a bit delirious and possessed ofthese strange new nihilistic ideas
decides that the best way out of thissituation would be just to kill the land
let the pawnbroker take her wealth whichhe all she does is keep it in a chest
free the niece so that seems like a goodidea so remove one apparently horrible
and useless person from the world freehis sister from the necessity of this
loveless marriage and allow him to go tolaw school where he can become educated
and do some good for the world you knowso one of the things that's lovely about
Dostoyevsky is that he you know whensometimes when one person is arguing
against another or when they're havingan argument in their head they make
their opponent into a straw man which isbasically they take their opponent and
curricular their perspective and try tomake it as weak as possible and and
laugh about it and and then they come upwith their argument and destroy this
straw man and feel that they've obtainedvictory but it's a very pathetic way of
thinking it's not thinking at all whatthinking is is when you adopt the
opposite position from your suppositionsand you make that argument as strong as
you can possibly make itand then you pit your perspective
against that that strong iron man notthe straw man and you argue it out you
battle it out and that's what Dostoevskydoes in his novels I mean he's the
people who stand for the antithesis ofwhat dust is dust is he actually
believes are often the strongestsmartest and sometimes most admirable
people in the book and sotakes great moral courage to do that and
you know in risk Olenick oov what hewanted to do was set up a character who
had every reason to commit murder everyreasonable reason philosophically
practically ethically even well so riskOlenick off goes and he kills the old
lady with an axe and it doesn't go theway he expects it will because what he
finds out is that post murderRaskolnikov and pre murder Raskolnikov
are not the same people at all they'renot even close to the same people he's
entered an entirely different universeand Dostoevsky does a lovely job of
describing that universe of horror andchaos and and and deception and and and
suffering and terror and all of that andhe doesn't even use the money he just
buries it in a and an alley as fast ashe can and then doesn't want anything to
do with it again and anyways the reasonI'm telling you all this is potentially
to entice you into reading the bookbecause it is an amazing amazing book
but also because you might say well hisrisk is what happened to Raskolnikov
true are the stories in that book trueand the answer to that is well from a
factual perspective clearly they'reuntrue but then if you think of
Raskolnikov as the embodiment of aparticular type of person who lived at
that time and the embodiment of acertain kind of ideology which had swept
across Europe and really invaded Russiaand which was actually a precursor a
philosophical precursor to the RussianRevolution then Raskolnikov is more real
than any one person he's like acomposite person he's like a person
who's irrelevant sees have beeneliminated for the purpose of relating
something about the structure of theworld and so I like to think of those
things as sort of meta real meta realthey're more real than real and of
course that's what you expect people todo when they tell you about their own
lives about their own day you don't wanta factual description of
every muscle twitch you want them todistill their experiences down into the
gist which is the significance of theexperience and the significance of the
experience is roughly what you canderive from listening to the experience
that will change the way that you lookat the world and act in the world so
it's valuable information and they cantell you a terrible story and then that
can be valuable because that can tellyou how not to look in the world look at
the world and act in it or they can tellyou a positive story you can derive
benefit either way which is why we alsolike to go watch stories about horrible
psychopathic thugs you know and andhopefully we're learning not to be like
them although there are additionaladvantages in that you know someone you
might be some say that someone who isincapable of cruelty is a higher moral
being than someone who is capable ofcruelty and I would say and this follows
young as well that that's incorrect andit's dangerously incorrect because if
you are not capable of cruelty you areabsolutely a victim to anyone who is and
so part of the reason that people gowatch anti heroes and villains is
because there's a part of them cryingout for the incorporation of the monster
within them which is what gives themstrength of character and self-respect
because it's impossible to respectyourself until you grow teeth and if you
grow teeth and you realize that you'resomewhat dangerous and let or maybe
somewhat seriously dangerous and thenyou might be more willing to demand that
you treat yourself with respect andother people do the same thing and so
that doesn't mean that being cruel isbetter than not being cruel what it
means is that being able to be cruel andthen not being cruel is better than not
being able to be cruel because in thefirst case you're nothing but weak and
naive and in the second case you'redangerous but you have it under control
and you know a lot of martial artsconcentrate on exactly that as part of
their philosophy of training it's likewe're not training you
to fight we're training you to bepeaceful and awake and avoid fights but
if you happen to have to get in one andthen I guess the philosophy also is is
that if you're competent at fightingthat actually decreases the probability
that you're going to have to fightbecause when someone pushes you you'll
be able to respond with confidence andwith any luck and this is certainly the
case with bullies with any lock areasonable show of confidence which is
very much equivalent to the show ofdominance is going to be enough to make
the bully back off and so the strengththat you develop in your monstrousness
is actually the best guarantee of peaceand that's partly why Jung believed that
it was necessary for people to integratetheir shadow and he said that was a
terrible thing for people to attemptbecause the human shadow mmm which is
all those things about yourself that youdon't want to realize reaches all the
way to hell and what he meant by thatwas it's through an analysis of your own
shadow that you can come to understandwhy other people are capable and you as
well of the sorts of terrible atrocitiesthat characterize let's say the 20th
century and without that understandingthere's no possibility of bringing it
under control when you study NaziGermany for example or you study the
Soviet Union particularly under Stalinand you're asking yourself well what are
these perpetrators like forget about thevictims let's talk about the
perpetrators the answer is they're justlike you and if you don't know that that
just means that you don't know anythingabout people including yourself and then
it also means that you have to discoverwhy they're just like you and believe me
that's no picnic so that's enough totraumatize people and that's partly why
they don't do it and it's also partlywhy the path to enlightenment and wisdom
is seldom trod upon because if it wasall a matter of following your bliss and
doing what made you happy then everyonein the world would be a paragon of
wisdom but it's not that at all it's theit's a matter of facing the thing you
least want to face and everyone has thatold there's this old story in King
Arthur wherethe night's go off to look for the Holy
Grail which is either the cup thatChrist drank out of it the Last Supper
or the cup into which the blood thatgushed from his side was poured when he
was crucified the stories vary but it'sit's basically a holy object like the
Phoenix in some sense that'srepresentation a representation of
transformation so it's a it's an idealand so King Arthur's knights who sit at
a round table because they're allroughly equal go off to find the most
valuable thing and they and where do youlook for the most valuable thing when
you don't know where it is well each ofthe knights looks at the forest
surrounding the castle and enters theforest at the point that looks darkest
to him and that's a good thing tounderstand because the gateway to wisdom
and the gateway to the development ofpersonality which is exactly the same
thing is precisely through the portholeportal that you do not want to climb
through and the reason for that'sactually quite technical this is a union
presupposition - is that well there's abunch of things about you that are
underdeveloped and a lot of those thingsare because there's things you've
avoided looking at because you don'twant to look at them and there's parts
of you you've avoided developing becauseit's hard for you to develop those parts
and so it's by virtual necessity thatwhat you need is where you don't want to
look because that's where you've kept itand so and that's why there's you know
an idiosyncratic element of it foreveryone your particular place of
enlightenment and terror is not going tobe the same as yours except that they're
both places of enlightenment and terrorso they're equivalent at one level of
analysis and and different than anotherso anyways back to the fiction and and
and and what it does if it distillstruth and it produces characters that
are composites and the more they becomecomposites the more they approximate a
mythological character and so theybecome more and more universally true
and more and more approximatingreligious deities but the problem with
that is they become more and moredistant from individual experience and
so withliterature there's this very tight line
where you need to make the charactermore than merely human but not so much
of a God that you know one of the thingsthat happened to Superman in the 1980s
Superman started out he's got a heavenlyset a parents by the way in an earthly
set of parents and he's an orphan likeHarry Potter very common theme is that
when Superman first emerged he couldonly jump out of her buildings you know
and maybe he could stop a locomotive butby the time the 1980s rolled around like
he could juggle planets and you knowswallow hydrogen bombs and you know he
could do anything well people stoppedbuying the Superman comics because how
interesting is that it's like somethinghorrible happens and Superman deals with
it and something else horrible happensand Superman deals with it and it's like
that's dull he turned into such anarchetype he was basically the
omniscient omnipresent omnipotent Godand that's no fun it's like God wins and
then God wins again and then again Godwins and you know so then they had to
weaken him in different ways withkryptonite you know so green kryptonite
kind of made him sick and red kryptoniteI think kind of mutated him if I
remember correctly and anyways they hadto introduce flaws into his characters
so that there could be some damn plotand that's something to think about you
know there's a deep existential lessonin that in that your being is limited
and flawed and fragile you're like thegenie which is genius in the little tiny
in the little tiny lampyou know this immense potential but
constrained in this tiny little livingspace as Robin Williams said when he
played the genie in Aladdin but the factthat you have limitations means that the
plot of your life is the overcoming ofthose limitations and that if you didn't
have limitations well there wouldn't bea plot and maybe there would be no life
and so that's part of the reason whyperhaps you have to accept the fact that
you're flawed and insufficient and andlive with it and consider it a
precondition for being it's at least areasonable
it's a reasonable idea so anyways one ofthe main characters is the country the
known the explored territory we wentover that a bit and it always has two
elements I mean your country is yourgreatest friend and your worst enemy you
know because it squashes you intoconformity and demands that you act in a
certain manner and reduces yourindividuality to that element that's
tolerated by everyone else and it itconstrains your potential in a single
direction and so it's really tyrannicalbut at the same time it provides you
with a place to be and all of thebenefits that have accrued as a result
of the actions of your ancestors and allthe other people that you're associated
with so there's the good tyrant or thebad tyrant and the good King and those
are archetypal figures and that'sbecause they're always true and they're
always true simultaneously you knowwhich is partly why I object to the
notion of the patriarchy because it's amyth the law the it's the what do you
call that it's the apprehension of amythological trope which is that of the
evil tyrant without any appreciation forthe fact that the archetype actually has
two parts and the other part is the wiseking and you know you can tell an evil
tyrant story about culture no problembut it's one-sided and that's very
dangerous because you don't want toforget all the good things that you have
while you're criticizing all the waysthat things are in error that's a lack
of gratitude and it's a lack of wisdomand it's it's founded in resentment and
it's it's very dangerous both personallyand socially I told you that Captain
Hook is a tyrant because he's got thiscrocodile chasing him in the crocodile
has a clock in its stomach and that'sdeath it's like obviously right tick
tick tick tick and it's a crocodile andit's under the water and it's already
got a taste of him so he's being chasedaround by death and that makes him
terrified and resentful and and crueland bitter
so he's a tyrant and he wants to wreakhavoc everywhere and then Peter Pan of
course looks at Captain Hook and thinkswhy the hell should I grow up and to be
a tyrant and sacrifice all the potentialof childhood and the answer to that is
the potential sacrifices itself if youdon't utilize it as you mature and you
just end up a 40 year old lost boy whichis a horrifying thing to behold it's
almost as if you're the corpse of achild the living corpse of a child
because who the hell wants asix-year-old 40 year old you're a little
on the stale side by that point and notthe world's happiest individual so you
know your potential is going todisappear because you aged anyways and
so you might as well shape thatpotential in a particular direction and
at least become something no matter howlimited rather than nothing so you know
Peter Pan that's a great story it's agreat mythological story so well so
let's talk about tyrants well not onlyare they mythological figures but they
exist and they tend to be deified I meanStalin was for all intents and purposes
God the Father in Soviet Russia althoughhe was pretty much only the worst
elements of Old Testament God who wasyou know constantly smiting people and
and wiping out populations and doing allsorts of things that seem to be quite
nasty but nonetheless you know peopleworshipped him in many ways and and he's
a representation of just exactly whatgoes wrong when things really go wrong
when people stop paying attention andwhen they all lie because one of the
things that characterized the communiststate was that no one ever got to say
anything they actually believed ever andthat was partly because one out of three
people was an informer which meant ifyou had a family of six people two of
them were informing on the governmentabout you and that included your own
children and you and if you were aninformer you were often amply rewarded
by the state so that if you lived in anovercrowded apartment building with
three families in the sameflat and you informed on you know the
woman down the hall that you didn't likeshe got shift shipped off to the old
concentration camp and you got herapartment and so that was a lovely
society and it only killed about thirtymillion people between 1919 and nineteen
fifty-nine so that's what happens whenthe archetypal structure gets tilted
badly when people forget that they havea responsibility to fulfill as citizens
as awake citizens who are capable ofstating the truth and the archetype
shift so there's nothing left of theGreat Father except the tyrant and let's
not have that happen I mean the one onthe right is really interesting because
consciously or unconsciously you knowthere's Stalin surrounded by what is for
all intents and purposes fire you knowhe looks like he looks like Maleficent
in Sleeping Beauty when she shows up atAurora's christening you know she puts
her arms up in the air and green firesurrounds her it's like it's like he's
surrounded by fire and there's Leninabove him who's like king of the fiery
realm and that's for sureso I mean all the terrors that happened
in the Soviet Union didn't start understell and they started under Lenin and
Lenin was or Stalin was definitelyLenin's legitimate son let's put it that
way so you know this is another exampleof the tyrannical element of the Great
Father and the sorts of things that canhappen I mean I kind of got a an evil
kick out of this bad that was quite oldyou know
it's kitschy in some sense and and youknow it shows I don't think that's
something you'd ever see at a magazinetoday
10 unusual stamps showing evil dictatoryou know well fair enough I mean that's
what he was and that's the consequenceand that's just a tiny bit of the
consequence because the Nazis wiped outa very large number of people often
using compassion as a as a as aas a justification so when they went
after the mentally ill and theterminally ill and those who whose
intelligence was compromised forbiological reasons and and those who
were too oldthey basically justified it by saying
that the enforced euthanasia wasmerciful and that you were actually
being a good person by complying withthe requirements and so something to
think aboutmore mythological representations I like
these quite a bit so there's theirHitler as you know Knight of the faith
essentially with I suppose that's arecreation of the Christian holy spirit
dove you know except it's an eagle whichis a bird of prey and and a prayer and
uh what do you call those things ascavenger right so that's kind of
interesting but that's Hitler as nightof the of the blood roughly speaking and
there this is an allied war posteressentially that assimilates the Nazis
to poisonous snakes and you know wedon't like poisonous snakes very much
and and it's probably because they'vebeen preying on us for approximately
twenty million years because snakes andprimates humans in particular co-evolved
and so the snake is a representation ofthat which lies outside the comfortable
domain and that can be you know a snakeobviously or it can be an abstract snake
and the abstract snake is your enemy oran even more abstract snake is the evil
in your own heart and this is going tobe a bit of a leap for you but there's
this ancient idea that developed in whatin the West over thousands of years far
predating Christianity that at least itsorigins that the snake in the Garden of
Eden was also Satan which is like ofwhat the hell it's a very strange idea
but the reason for that as far as I cantell is that you know we have this
circuitry that detects predators and apredator
representation of a predator is a snakeor a monster that incorporates
snake-like features like a dragon orsomething like that or a dinosaur with
lots of teeth or a shark that livesunder the water and will pull you down
you know because I suspect a lot of ourancestors met a nasty death at the hands
of Nile crocodiles while they were inthe African veldt going down to get some
nice water so you know that's the thingthat jumps up and pulls you under and
you know that happens in your own lifebecause things jump up and pull you
under you know and use the samecircuitry we use the same circuitry to
process unknown things that upset us aswe once used to detect predators who
were likely to invade our space and soand and human beings are capable of
abstraction and so you know you couldthink about the real predator that might
invade your space and maybe that's asnake or a wolf or or some kind of
monster you know and that's prettyconcrete and biological chimps have that
you know chimps don't like snakes and soif you a chimp comes across a snake in
the wild then like a big let's say Idon't know what live with chimps I don't
know if they're pythons but they haveconstrictors there anyways so you know
maybe there's like a 20 foot constrictorand this and the chimp like stays a good
distance away from it but it won't leaveand then it has this particular cry that
it uh ters that's called a snake rah WRAa and so it makes this noise which means
something like holy shit that's a bigsnake and I actually mean that because
the circuits that primates use to utterdistress calls are the same circuits
that we use to curse just so you knowthat's why people with Tourette's
syndrome swear because like what what'sup with that how can you have a
neurological condition that makes youswear well it turns out that guttural
effect Laden curses are mediated by adifferent speech circuit and that's the
speech circuit we share with thepredator alarms of other primates so
that's pretty cool so anyways this chimpstands there and makes this snake noise
and then all bunch of other chimps comerunning and you know some of them stay a
fair ways from the snakecan some of them get pretty close but
they'll stand there and watch that snakefor like 24 hours you know so they're
fascinated by it and you know if you'vehandled snakes you can understand that
fascination because they're fascinatingyou know and they're numinous I would
say that that's the right way of puttingit at numinous is a word that means
intrinsically meaningful like a fire youknow you can't look away from fire you
know if you're sitting in front of afireplace it's like you're staring at it
and that's because you're all descendedfrom the first mad chimpanzee who had
some weird genetic mutation that made itimpossible for him to stay away from
fire it was like the first chimparsonist you know and and he figured it
out and well hey now he was a chimp witha stick with fire on it like that's a
mega chimp man and so you know we havethat mutation in spades and no wonder so
anyways so they they make this you knowthey have this reaction to snakes and
chimps that have never seen a snake ifthey're in a cage and you throw a rubber
snake in there it's like bang they hitthe roof but then they look at the snake
you know it's so it's like it'sterrifying and fascinating at the same
time and you should look at the snakebecause you want to know what it does
but you should stay away from it becauseit's a snake so you you're kind of
screwed in terms of your motivationsright one is get the hell away and the
other is well don't don't let that thingdo anything that you're not watching and
so that's really the reaction we have tothe unknown it's terrifying but we watch
it and then you know the meta story isthat not only do we watch it but we go
explore it and so you might think wellback in the Garden of Eden so to speak
when we were living in trees the snakesused to come and eat us and and our
offspring more likely and you know weweren't very happy about that and then
we figured out how to maybe maybe byaccident draw up a stay a stick on a
snake and that was a good thing becausethe snake didn't like that and then
maybe the next thing we learned a littlelater was to like actually take a stick
and likeock the snake with it and you can
believe that the first primate whofigured out that was just as popular as
the guy who mastered fire and so we'repretty good at whacking state snakes
with sticks which is why Springfield hasa snake
whacking day it's devoted to nothing butthat right I don't know if you know that
Simpsons episode but it's quite comicalso well so then you think about the
snake as a predator and it's the thingthat invades the garden always because
you just can't keep snakes out of thedamn garden no matter how hard you try
and then you think of snakes and maybeyou think of meta snakes and like a meta
snake would be also a predator but maybethat's the predator that represents the
the destructive spirit of the othertribe because chimpanzees for example
are quite tribal and they definitely goto war with one another and so you think
you abstract out the idea of thepredator to represent malevolence as
such and then you take that one stepfurther and you realize that the worst
of all evil predators is the humancapacity for evil and then at that point
you know you're starting to I would saypsychologize or spiritual eyes the idea
of danger and making it make it intosomething that's conceptual and
something that's psychological andsomething that you can you can face sort
of on mas I mean one of the thingspeople had to figure out was how do you
deal with danger and so you feel figureout how you deal with a specific danger
but then because human beings are deathso damn smart they thought well what if
we considered the class of all dangerousthings and then what have we considered
a a mode of being that was the best modeof being in the face of the class of all
dangerous things well that's a lotbetter you get you know you could solve
all the dangerous problems all at onceinstead of having to conjure up a
different solution for every dangerousthing and that's basically as far as I
can tell where the hero's story camefrom and the hero's story is basically
you know there's a community it'sthreatened by the emergence of some old
eviloften represented by a dragon that's
sort of typical say of the Lord of theRings stories there's a hero often a
humble guy but not always sometimes aknight decides he'll go out there you
know and chase down the snake maybe evenor the serpent or the dragon maybe even
in its lair and he'll have a bunch ofadventures on the way that transform him
from you know useless naive Hobbit intoyou know sword wielding hero and he
confronts the dragon and gets the goldand frees the people that it had
enslaved and then comes back transformedto share what he's learned with the
community it's like well that's thehuman story fundamentally and that's
that's our basic instinctive pattern andit's represented in narratives
constantly and that's partly what thissee this has meaning you know what this
meanswhy why do you know well you know
because it draws on symbolicrepresentations that you already
understand you understand that a mess oftooth snakes is not a good thing and
that may be the sensible thing to do isstomp them and it's not like you need an
instruction manual to figure out whatthe poster means and so you know that's
two different representations of Hitlerthat's sort of the pro-hitler
representation and I would say that'sthe anti-hitler representation and you
know that's the real Hitler who at thispoint does not look like a very happy
clam so so that's the known that'sculture that's order and what's
eternally juxtaposed to culture and theknown and the explored and order is the
unknown and the unknown is a strangeplace the unknown is actually it's a
physical place like the unknown is theplace that when you're camping and
you're around a fire the unknown iseverything outside the circle of the
light and you remember in the Lion Kingyou may not remember when when when
Mufasa that's the king right goes andtakes Simba up to show him his territory
he says he is the king of everythingthat the light touches
and that's a very old idea and you guyshad no problem with you know that was
fine that made sense and that I would beon the light was the darkness and that
was the elephant graveyard that wasdeath that was the place of death and
danger that's where the hyenas hung outand you weren't supposed to go there and
so of course Simba because he's a rulebreaking hero just like Harry Potter
immediately goes there and so you knowthat's like the forbidden fruit it's the
same sort of idea if you want someone todo something the best thing to do is
tell them that they shouldn't and notexplain why you know so for example if I
said to you at the beginning of thisclass look I've got one rule here don't
sit in that chair no matter what you'dbe thinking the whole year especially if
I reminded you well just what's up withthat chair like let's chair as magical
all of a sudden you some of you mighteven well you probably wouldn't because
this is a ridiculous example but maybeyou know you come to class early and sit
in that chair just to see what wouldhappen you know and people are very
curious and that's exactly what we'relike and that's a very old story too
right it's like opening Pandora's boxdon't open that box you'll be sorry it's
like oh huh you know all the horrors ofthe world fly out and believe me you
will open Pandora's box many times inyour life because you know with your
family or maybe your mate or maybe yourchildren you'll have this idea that they
have a box with things in it that youwant to know about and you'll say well
I'm kind of curious about thisparticular event so why don't you tell
me about it and they say well no weprobably really shouldn't open that box
and you keep bugging them and then theyopen it and then all sorts of things fly
out that you didn't expect and thenmaybe you think hey it would have been
better if I would have just left thatdamn box closed but and you can do the
same thing to yourself believe meand so the Pandora's box idea the
forbidden fruit idea that's that's amajor-league idea and part of the reason
in the judeo-christian tradition whypeople are saddled with the notion of
original sin is because hyper corticallydeveloped chimpanzees without much sense
cankeep their hands off things and so they
keep exploring even when they knowbetter and every time they do that they
learn something that is that destroysthe paradise that they currently inhabit
right because there's plenty Unni and Inever learned anything in your life
that's of importance without it having apretty damn destabilizing effect on you
at the moment of realisation right youlearn something happy it's like whatever
you know that all that means is that Iwas doing things right like it's nice
and everything but it's not informativeyou do something and all hell breaks
loose that'll make you think that's forsure you might never stop thinking for
the rest of your life so anyways theunknown the unknown is that which
surrounds the known it's an unexploredterritory it's usually represented as
female I think for a variety of reasonsand not not as female exactly it's not
the right way to think about it asfeminine and that's not the same thing
because feminine is a symbolic categorywhereas female is like an actual female
and so you don't want to confuse themetaphor with with the with the
actuality because we have these socialcognitive categories built-in you know
you might say masculine feminine andoffspring something like that we had to
use what we could to represent what wewere attempting to figure out and we
kind of mapped them onto the externalrealities of being the best we could
using what we could and so you knownature is benevolent and it's fruitful
you know all things come from nature andall things come from the unknown right
because the known is already there it'sthe unknown that manifests the new right
and so that's part of the reason for thecharacterization of the unknown as
feminine and then there's also the casethat women play a massive role in sexual
selection among human beings so that mmmfrom an evolutionary perspective you're
twice as likely to be a failure ifyou're a man then you
or if you're a woman in that you havetwice as many female ancestors as male
ancestors and you think well that'simpossible but it's not all you have to
do is imagine that every woman has onechild half the men have two and the
other half have zero and so end ofproblem and that's basically how it
works out so women are more choosymater's than men by a substantial margin
there was a funny study done by the guywho established it's one of the big
dating sites and he looked at how womenrated men and they rated the 50th
percentile man at the 15th percentile so85% of men were below average according
to women's ratings now men had theirsame arbitrary choices because of course
they preferred younger women to olderwomen and and they were more swayed I
would say by by attractiveness but thatdidn't have set nearly as big an effect
on their actually actually writing ofwomen so anyway so you know from from a
Darwinian perspective nature is thatwhich selects so that's all it is and so
sexual selection plays a massive role inhuman evolution you know the fact that
we have these massive brains is verylikely a consequence of a positive
feedback loop and sexual selectionyou know because otherwise that's the
only time you can get really rapidchanges in evolutionary space where you
know you get a process going thatreinforces itself so there's a little
preference for intelligence and thenthat produces more intelligent men and
women and then there's a little morepreference for intelligence and you know
maybe then that turns into the abilityto speak and or to master fire and then
there's way more selection forintelligence and the brain just goes
like this you know and women have paid apretty big price for that because your
hips are basically so wide that you canbarely run and if they were any wider
than you couldn't and of course thepelvic passageway through which the baby
travels is too small so it'sreally painful and dangerous and the
baby's head has to compress quite a lotI mean they come out cone-shaped often
and then they're born really young soyou have to take care of them forever
like what the hell you know a deer isborn a fawn is born and it's like two
seconds later it's standing and thenit's running from a lion it's like you
know it's like 15 minutes later and ababy it's like you just lies there and
you know utters plaintive noises that'sall it can do and that does that for
like ten months before it could skitteraway from a sloth if it was predatory
you know so you really got to take careof those creatures and so that's a big
price to pay that's a big price to payfor our cortical evolution so anyways
here is some of the symbolic representsrepresentatives of the unknown the
unconscious Dionysian force of the it'dthat sort of Freud's representation of
the unknown the terrors of the darknessthat's the unknown the monsters that
lurk they're the source and the restingplace of all things the great mother the
Queen the matrix which means matterwhich means mother
the matriarch matter mother thecontainer the cornucopia the object to
be fertilized the source of all thingsthe fecund
the pregnant the strange the emotionalthe foreigner the place of return and
rest the deep the valley the cleft thecave hell death and the grave because
it's beyond the moon ruler of the nightand mysterious dark and matter and the
earth then you know all this becausewhen you watch a movie that's rife with
symbolic representations it draws onthose underlying metaphors and they're
natural I mean where does a witch livewell in a swamp for God's sake she
doesn't live in the penthouse of a NewYork Tower she lives in a swamp and it's
dark there and if the moon's up that's abetter and maybe it could be a crescent
moon or maybe it could be a full moonbut you know witches live in the right
place if you're going to understand itand you all you understand all of that
and it's part of the structure of yourimagination you could say
and so it's part of the unspokenfantastical imagination that unites all
of us and it makes us specifically humanthere's a good representation of the
underworld and the place oftransformation so that's Hell in Isis in
Egypt was queen of the underworld andthe underworld generally has a queen and
she usually shows up when order fallsapart and so you go to the underworld
when your life falls apart that's whatit means and so when you see these
stories of the hero you know journeyingto unknown lands of terror and danger
that's that's what happens to you ithappens to you all the time you know
you're you're in this little safe spacelike The Hobbit in the Shire and then
you know there's a great evil brewingsomewhere and you can no longer ignore
it so off you go into the land of terrorand uncertainty and better to go on
purpose then accidentally that's forsure because at least you can be
prepared and we also know that if you'regoing to face a threat if you face it
voluntarily what happens is your bodyactivates itself for exploration and
mastery but if you face it involuntarilysame size threat then you you you you
revert to pray pray mode and you'refrozen and that's way way way more
stressful it's way harder on your bodyand so it's better to keep your eye open
and watch for emergent threats becauseyou all know you know what you're not
doing quite right and where your life islikely to unravel you all have a sense
of that and the best thing to do is tonot ignore that to pay attention to it
to watch it and to take correctiveaction early and then you know you stay
on top of things and things your littletrip to the underworld might be a few
minutes long instead of a catastrophethat produces post-traumatic stress
disorder knocks you out for four or fiveyears and maybe you never recover so and
that's right you know that's what thesekind of symbolic representations mean
it's those are states of being that thatthat indicate being devoured and you can
be devouredyour own unconscious Jesus that happens
all the time what does that mean wellyou know and it's an autonomous thing in
some sense you know like if you if youget depressed or if you get really
anxious you don't have any control overthat it's like it sweeps up over you and
pulls you down why down well down iswhere you go when you're sad you don't
go up man I'm up today oh that's too badno it's man I'm down today and well
that's partly this and it's partlybecause this is subordinate and it's
partly because down is closer to theground and farther from the sky like
there's all sorts of reasons you'refeeling down rather than up up is where
you're aiming right yeh MUP you don'taim down well there the reason those
phrases make sense is because they'relocked deeply into this underlying
structure of imagination and well thoseare the architect or the archetypal
structures according to Jung and I Ithink that he's far as I can tell he's
dead accurate and I think we understandthe biology of such things much better
than we did so there is morerepresentations she's she's quite the
friendly creature that's KellyI like this representation better those
are heads by the way in hands so shesort of represents well very complex
things she represents death sherepresents transformation in this I
already like this representation I thinkit's brilliant so imagine that what the
people were doing who formulated theserepresentations what they were trying to
do was to make a representation of thedomain of threat itself right so that
they could deal with the idea thatbecause we can say threat well what is
that what the hell does that mean wellthreat is the category of all
threatening things and so then you canthink about threat and you can think
about threat across all those individualinstances and maybe you can figure out
how to deal with threat right how what'sthe best way to be in the world so that
you most effectively deal with threatwell that's sort of like apart from how
do you deal with pain that's sort oflike the ultimate
question of human beings you want to beterrified No
so you want to be in danger No so likeyou better figure out how to deal with
threat so first of all you have toconceptualize it so we'll take a look at
this representation so that's Kellyshear
her hair is on fire well fire you knowthat's that's a numinous phenomena
dangerous but transformative she'swearing a headdress of skulls she has a
weapon in this hand and and she has atiger's tongue she often has a snake
around her waist need none of these dobut she often does but in this case this
then that's because you know it it's asnake we've already covered that well
these things that look like snakes herearen't you notice how her belly is
concave well it's because she's justgiven birth to this unfortunate person
that she happens to be standing on andshe's eating him intestines first and
that's a fire ring which he is in andthen it's got skulls on the inside of it
it's like what's that supposed to dowell partly it's supposed to represent
that which terrifies you it's like yeahfair enough man because I don't imagine
you saw those things in there before Iexplained them but someone who was
familiar with that image would know whatit meant it's like some poor artist was
sitting there thinking well how do Irepresent destruction it's like bang
whoa okay well put that down and then wewon't look at it again so and then what
do you do with this you make sacrificesto it and you think well that's kind of
primitive you know first of all wellthat doesn't really exist well it does
if it's an amalgam of threat symbols Ican tell you that it exists that's for
sure so it exists as an abstraction ifnothing else do you offer it sacrifices
well what the hell do you think you dowhat are you doing in class why aren't
you like drinking vodka and snortingcocaine you know because you could be
doing that instead here you arelistening to me you know slaving away in
university you're young it's like reallyyou've got nothing better to do than sit
there you know well what you're willingto forego today
pleasure for tomorrow's advantage andthat's what sacrifice is and human
beings discovered that dramaticallyfirst you know like we were we were apes
for God's sake we didn't just leap upand think oh we better save for tomorrow
you know we it took thousands of yearsfor that idea to emerge and it emerged
in dramatic form and it was sort of likewell society is sort of like a god know
what they weren't thinking this throughis like if you're gonna represent
society well it's like thismasculine God that's always judging the
hell out of you that's everywhere all atthe same time it's like yeah yeah that's
true absolutely and what do you have todo with it well you have to give it what
it wants why why do you have to give itwhat it wants because it'll crush you if
you don't and that's exactly rightand if you're lucky and you give it the
right sacrifice then it'll smile on youand you get to have a good life and that
was like that was the major discovery ofmankind man that was a killer discovery
it was like the discovery of the futureyou know we discovered the future as a
place and it was a place that you couldbargain with you can bargain with the
future wow that's just what an idea thatis you know it's it's so unlikely well
how do you bargain with the future wellyou give it what it wants and you know
some of that you maintain your socialrelationship and you know you make
yourself useful to other people and youshape yourself so that you can cooperate
with people and you you don't actimpulsively and maybe you squirrel
something away for the next harvest evenif you're hungry and you know and then
the future isn't hell and you make theproper sacrifices and so if you
sacrifice to Kelly then she turns intoher opposite and showers benevolence on
you and that's Mother Nature right it'slike look out for Mother Nature man you
know two weeks out in the bush right nowand you're dead and it's not pleasant
and then if it's the spring you lastlonger huh but the bugs eat you and so
that's not very fun eitherso nature you know it's bent on your
destruction but if you treat it properlyand carefully and make the right
sacrifices then maybe one of her treeswill offer you some fruit and that would
be okay and so believe me lots of peopledied trying to figure that out
so here's another way of looking at itso I said you know order and chaos known
unknown explored territory unexploredterritory I love this this is the Taoist
symbol it's a symbol of being and beingisn't reality as you would conceptualize
it as a scientist it's more like realityas it manifests itself to you as a
living thing which is completelydifferent you know science extracts out
all the subjectivity all it is there isan array of our objective facts of
equivalent value and that's part of itsmethod but that's not the world in which
you live the world in which you live isfull of motivation and emotion it's full
of terror and pain and joy andfrustration and and other people that's
for sure and so that's the real worldand so well that's what this is it's
it's the real world and what is it madeout of well it's made out of all those
things you know that can get out of handyou know because the explored territory
and the known can get so damn tight thatit's nothing but a tyrant and then it's
all those things you don't know andthat's pretty exciting because you know
you want to go find out some things youdon't know and that adds a lot of spice
to life you want a little adventure youdon't want to go out with someone who's
so predictable that you know everythingabout them in a week you know unless
you're hyper conservative you want to goout with someone who's got they're a
little erratic like not too erraticlet's say they're a little dangerous
perhaps not too dangerous but some ofthat at least you want predictability
with a bit of unpredictability in therewell that's exactly what this means it's
like that's predictability with a littleunpredictability in it and what that
also means is that what you know can beturned into what you don't know just
like that and that's going to happen toyou lots of times in your life man when
someone close to you dies suddenly it'slike poof
order turns into chaos and now you're inchaos and what the hell are you gonna do
there and that's a good questionbecause you need to know what to do
there cuz you're gonna be there and ithappens to you when your dreams fall
apart you know I mean your dreams foryour life or you know when you discover
something awful about yourself that youdidn't know or you know it flips on you
all the time and in small ways sometimesyou know you have a fight with a friend
or in big ways that that wipe you outfor well indefinitely sometimes because
you can fall into chaos and never getout you know that's the people who are
trapped in the belly of the beast itisn't necessary that when you descend
into chaos that you learn something andyou get back out you could just be stuck
there suffering until you die and that'syou know I wouldn't recommend that you
know it's something to avoid but ithappens to people all the time all the
time you see them wandering around youknow shattered on the streets of Toronto
you know they're done they're in chaosand there's so much chaos around them
that you won't even go near them thechaos spreads like eight feet around
them and so when you see someone likethat you're like well first we're not
going to look too closely and peoplelike that often don't like you to look
at them because that also helps themremember where they are and that's no
Pleasant thing and you're gonna juststay away from that maybe you'll cross
the street maybe you'll keep your headdown whatever you're not going anywhere
near that chaos and no bloody wonder youknow and and you don't think about it
much after you pass it because it's ahell of a thing to think about and what
are you gonna do about it anyway so youdon't know what to do about it you might
just make it worse well so chaos youknow that's the other half of life and
it can turn into order sometimes betterorder that's actually what you do when
you explore right you explore you findout something new not too new not to
Pandora boxy you know you bite off asmuch as you can chew but no more and so
that rearranges the way you look at theworld but you're doing it voluntarily so
you can kind of tolerate there therecalibration and you strength
and the order right because now youbecome more competent and I would say
that you're trying to live on the edgebetween order and chaos and I and I mean
that's a real place that's an actualit's a meta place but it's more real
than places because it's so old it'ssuch an old place it really exists and
your nervous system knows that it seesthe world this way in fact the right
hemisphere is roughly specialized forchaos and the left hemisphere is roughly
specialized for order which is why theleft hemisphere tends to have the
linguistic elements and and why peopleare right-handed and the right
hemisphere has a more diffuse structureit's more associated with negative
emotion and imagination and the twocommunicate between each other through
the corpus callosum and the righthemisphere appears to update the less
left hemisphere kind of slowly often indreams and so if you were hurt if your
right hemisphere is hurt for exampleback here in the parietal lobe then you
lose the left part of your body youcan't move it anymore
but you also lose the idea that you havea left part of your body so it's like
blindness it's a blindness to the leftand so if someone comes along and says
you know you're not moving your left armyou're gonna say yeah well my arthritis
is bothering me 2d have moved it for sixmonths MA my arthritis is bothering
today or you know you don't move in yourleft foot it's like well you know uh I'm
too tired well what's happened is theleft hemisphere has a representation of
the body and it's not being updatedbecause the part of the brain that would
notice that the left is gone because ofa stroke it isn't there anymore and so
the left already has a model and it'snot gonna change just it's hard to
change your model of yourself you knowhave a tooth pulled what happens it's
like your damn tongue is in that holefor the next six months fiddling around
constantly and that's because you'rerebuilding your neurological model of
your body it's like try it out with yourwhole left side and see how well you do
you know so this guy named Ramachandranwas experimenting with people like this
and one of the things he did was kind ofhe was checking their balance and you
can do that byirrigating the ear with cold water and
that makes people go like this makestheir eyes move back and forth because
it upsets the vestibular system and whathe found was that if he if he poured
cold water in the left ear of someonewith right per aisle damage who had left
neglect that they'd all of a sudden sortof wake up catastrophic ly they'd have a
terrible reaction to the fact that theywere paralyzed on the left and they
would know that it had happened and cryand you know amid all sorts of distress
and no wonderand then like 20 minutes later they'd
snap back into their damaged mode ofbeing and they would not deny because
that isn't really what it is is thatthey couldn't update the model they just
didn't have the neurology for it anymoreso they were back to not noticing that
it was gone and coming up with storiesabout it and so well so that's a good
example of how the right and lefthemispheres worked together and how
they're kind of mapped onto this weirdlyenough so you know we're map were
adapted to the meta reality and so whatthat would be is we're adapted to that
which remains constant across thelongest spans of time and that's not the
same things that you see flitting aroundyou day to day those are just they just
like clouds they're just evaporating youknow there's things underneath that that
are more fundamental that are morefundamental realities like the dominance
hierarchy like the tribe like the dangeroutside of society like the threat that
other people pose to you and that youpose to yourself
those are eternal realities and we'readapted to those that's our world and
that's why we express that in storiesand so then you might say well how do
you adapt yourself to this world and theanswer to that isn't I believe this is a
neurological answer I believe this thatyour brain can tell you when you're
optimally situated between chaos andorder and the way it tells you that is
by producing the sense of engagement andmeaning so let's say there's a place in
the environment you should be okay whatshould that place be
well you don't want to be terrified outof your skull like what good is that and
you know you don't want to be socomfortable that you might as well sleep
you want to be somewhere where you knowyou're kind of on firm ground here but
over here you're kind of testing out newterritory and some of you who are
exploratory and emotionally stable youknow you're gonna go pretty far out into
the unexplored territory withoutdestabilizing yourself and other people
are gonna just put a toe in the chaosand you know that's neuroticism
basically that's that your sensitivityto threat that's calibrated differently
in different people and more some peopleare more exploratory than others that's
kind of extraversion and opennessworking together and and intelligence so
some people are going to tolerate alarger admixture of chaos in their order
those are liberals by the way and I meanthat technically liberals are more
interested in novel chaos andconservatives are more interested in the
stabilization of the structures thatalready exist and who's right well it
depends on the situation and that's whyconservatives and liberals have to talk
to each other because one of them isn'tright and the other wrong sometimes the
conservatives are right and sometimesthe liberals are right because the
environments go in like this you can'tpredict the damn thing so that's why you
have to communicate and that's what ademocracy does it allows people of
different temperamental types tocommunicate and to calibrate the damn
societies so anyways so let's say you'reoptimally balanced between chaos and
order so what does that mean well you'restable enough but you're interested
right because a little novelty heightensyour anxiety that wakes you up a bit
that's the adventure part of it but italso focuses the part of your brain that
does exploratory activity and that'sactually associated with pleasure
that's the dopamine circuit and so ifyou're optimally balanced and you know
that you know you're there when you'relistening to an interesting conversation
or you're engaged in one it's a realconversation you know you're saying some
things you know and the other person issaying some things they know
but the both of what you know ischanging it's like wow that's so
interesting you'll have a conversationlike that forever or maybe you're
reading a book like that or you'relistening to a piece of music that
models that because what music does isprovide you with predictable forms
multi-level predictable forms thattransform
just the right amount and so music is avery representational art form it says
this is what the universe is like youknow there's a dancing element to it
repetitive and then cute littlevariations that sort of surprise and
delight you and and you think wow that'sso cool and it doesn't matter how
nihilistic you are you know music stillinfuses you with a sense of meaning and
that's because it models meaning that'swhat it does that's why we love it and
you know you can dance to it and thatsort of symbolizes you putting yourself
in harmony with these multiple layers ofreality and positioning yourself
properly and you like that too you knowyou'll pay for it oh boy I get to go
dancing you know oh boy I get to listento music it's like what the hell are you
doing listening to music what good isthat well you think that's a stupid
question I don't care about your dopeycriticism I'm going to listen to some
music right it did there's no rationalthere's no rational argument against
music it's like you just don't eventhink about it you just walk away from
someone who's stupid enough to ask thatquestion it's like some things are
obviouswell why okay so that's pretty fun so
what mediates between these two domainswell that's what consciousness does far
as I can tell and that's sort of theindividual and that's the hero that's
another way of thinking about it it'sthe logos that's another way of thinking
about it it's the word that generatesorder out of chaos at the beginning of
time it's the consciousness thatinteracting with the matter of the world
produces being that's basically itthat's basically you for all intents and
purposeshow do you do that well the unconscious
does it to some degree you know becauseit's with our fantasy that we first meet
the unknown right well look say you'regoing out with a new person it's like
what do you do you project a fantasy onthem and then you fall in love with the
fantasy and aren't you stupid becauseyou're gonna find out that the match
between your damn fantasy and the actualperson is tenuous at best and so young
would call that a projection of eitherthe anima or the animus you know the
anima is what a man projects onto awoman he finds desirable it's like oh
she's the perfect womanit's like well how do you know that
you've like seen her for four secondsyou know but it grips you and the same
thing happens in the opposite directionand it's an action of instinct you know
it's like you fall in love with theimage and but interestingly enough what
you do in a relationship that works isthat you actually I think that what you
seeit's a rough approximation when you
project the ideal and fall in love withit you see what could be it could be
that but it's going to take you a hellof a lot of work because like you got no
shortage of flaws and the other personhas no shortage of flaws and so you're
bringing your flaws together and that'sgoing to produce a lot of friction and
you're gonna have to engage in a lot ofdialogue before you approach that level
of perfection again but maybe you can doit then you get to live happily ever
afterwell would not be nice well so the
unconscious meets the unknown and it itmeets it with imagination and fantasy
and dream and art that's how you take soyou don't just go from what you don't
know to fully articulated knowledge inone bloody leap you can't do that you
have to extend pseudo pods of fantasyand imagination into the unknown that's
kind of what theorizing is like righteven scientifically you know you don't
know something scientifically yougenerate a theory well it's an
imaginative representation that yourunconscious is helping you generate and
so you meet the unknown with fantasythat's what the unconscious is for from
the psychoanalytic perspective that'swhat
rheems do and you can see why you dreamabout the future you know it's like well
what's the future gonna be like well youhave a little imaginative story going on
and it's like you don't really create itit's sort of you watch it unfold you
know maybe you could tweak it here andthere but it sort of comes to you from
wherever the hell things like that comefrom you know the unconscious that's the
psychoanalytic answer it's not reallymuch of an answer because it's more like
a representation of a place that wedon't understand but that's where
creativity comes from and I mean somepeople are really creative right down to
the bloody core so in my clinicalpractice I often see people who are high
in openness because they're attracted tome because they watch my lectures and
you have to kind of be high in opennessto like my lectures so because well you
do because they go everywhere you knowand and they're not necessarily very
orderly so so anyways lots of my clientsare really high in openness and they're
funny people often especially if they'resmart because sometimes they have the
most nihilistic intelligence you canimagine it's just self-critical and
nihilistic and brutally brutal man andsmart and so they just criticize
themselves out of existence and so oftenI have to just try to get them to quit
listening to their chattering rightself-critical rationality and go out and
create something you know with theirmassive creativity and as long as
they're doing that they're engaged inthe world and happy as hell but as soon
as that self-critical rationality comesin and shuts down the creativity they're
just they're just like walking corpsesyou know and it's because if you're
really open like that's your a tree andit has some trunks and you know your
your most prominent trait is the mostlively trunk and if you're a creative
person and you're not engaging in acreative enterprise
you're just you're like a tree that thathas been that has had its vitality
amputated and so this is not trivialthis stuff is this is deeply deeply
deeply rooted in your biology and andthose are people often who have like
dream lives you just can't believe Ihave one client
he has like four spectaculardreams a week and most of the time we
just spend discussing them I mean God heand I had another client who could be
lucid in her dreams which is more commonamong women she could ask the damn
characters what they represented andthey would tell her it was like okay
that was pretty weird and like a lot ofthe things they told her were really
helpful and they were not things thatshe wanted to hear she she basically one
of them told her she if she was gonnalive she'd have to go visit a
slaughterhouse and the reason for thatwas because she was raised as a little
princess and protected from horriblemother nature until she hit puberty in
which time she turned into an evilvillain because that's how the family
worked perfect childevil teenager overnight and then well
that was hard on her and she wasn'tprepared because she thought the world
was princess world and you know shecouldn't go through a butcher store
without having a fit and no wonder youknow like really Jesus you know it's no
wonder but you do it but she couldn't sowe used to go to butcher stores and that
would make her cry and and that she wasa vegetarian that would make her cry and
you know bemoan the cruelty of the worldand it's like yeah fair enough man those
are bloody slabs of meat it's like Idon't know why everyone isn't screaming
when they walk through the butcher storebut but you got to get used to it man
because you can't live in the worldotherwise and so the dream character who
was a gypsy told her that she had to govisit a slaughterhouse which seemed
rather impractical and so I asked her ifshe could think of anything else to do
and she saw it well why don't we govisit a funeral home and and watch an
embalming and I thought oh how good thatsounds that sounds like a fun way to
spend a day and so I phoned up a funeralparlor and I said I had a client it was
terrified of death yeah and I was thetherapist who was also a little shaky on
the concept myself and so they they hadno problem with that they deal with
death all the time which is reallysomething to think about right a human
being can actually have an occupationwhere they do nothing but deal with
death and they don't go stark raving madit's like what the hell's up
with that it's like working in apalliative care ward where your your
clients that you you know have arelationship all they're gonna do is die
this week next week the week afterpeople do that it's like those people
are tough man they're tough so anywayswe went and watched this embalming which
was I have a rather high level ofdisgust sensitivity so it was a little
on the rough side for me but she satthere and first while she was not we
were outside this little room she wasnot looking at that man no way and she
kind of go like this and you know thatwas pretty good and then she'd go like
this and then she go like this and thenand she watched it and then she asked if
she could go in and she put on the gloveand she touched the body and she didn't
have a fit she didn't have a panicattack and so she walked away from there
learning that there was a hell of a lotmore to her than she thought there was
and that she could see things that shedidn't think she could see and live and
after that she sort of had a touchstoneit's like well I'm kind of afraid of
this well is it as bad as going to seethe embalming
no it's not that bad well I guess I cando it it's like an initiation right she
had an initiation and so did I you knowand I learned a lot from doing that I
learned that one of the things you needto do if you're going to be a human
being is to prepare yourself to beuseful in the face of death and so when
you have a parent that dies which youknow shatters people's ideas often they
can't even think about it if you can'teven think about that man you've got
some thinking to do because you need tobe able to at least think about that
because otherwise you're just gonna be awasteland when it happens and you never
know you could even have a higherambition maybe you could even be useful
when it happens instead of being part ofthe heap of destroyed people who also
have to be taken care of you know andthat's brutal you have to be brutal to
be useful in the aftermath of yourparents death you know you don't get to
crumble and fall apart and no you haveevery reason to so you got to be kind of
some tough monster to manage that butyou want to be useful in the face of
tragedy or do you want to bewell you make your choice so out of the
unconscious you get ritual you getdreams you get drama you get stories you
get art you get music and that sort ofbuffers us we have our little domain of
competence and we're buffered by thedomain of fantasy and culture and that's
really what you learn about when youcome to university if you're lucky and
and the professors are smart enough toactually teach you something about
culture instead of constantly tellingyou that it's completely reprehensible
and should be destroyed it's like whyyou would prefer chaos to order is
beyond me and the only possible reasonis that you haven't read enough history
to understand exactly what chaos meansand believe me if you understood what it
means you'd be pretty goddamn carefulabout tearing down the temple that you
live in unless you want to be a denizenof chaos and some people do you know
because that's when the impulses thatyou Harbor can really come out and shine
and so a little gratitude is in orderand that makes you appreciative of the
wise King well being smart enough toknow that he's also an evil tyrant it's
like that's that's a total conception ofthe world it's balanced it's like yeah
we should preserve nature but good godit is trying to kill us and you know
yes our culture is tyrannical andoppressive people but it is protecting
us from dying that's helpful you knowand yes we're reasonably good people but
like don't take that theory too faruntil you've tested yourself and you
know that's wisdom at least in part andthat's what these stories try to teach
youthere's a nice mythological
representation I love this one it's likethe Dome of the known and the seeker
looking outside you know that's a that'sa metaphysical representation you know
and then that is the world as it looksto us right you go out in a field and it
looks like there's a dome covering itit's a circle a big circle with a dome
over it and you know what's outside thedome well the unknown right that's where
heaven is theoreticallyyou know it's a projection obviously
heaven is in the unknown well it waslocalized in space
I suppose that's partly because whenpeople looked up in the sky they were
overwhelmed with all so it's areasonable conclusion you know it it's a
projection of an unconsciouspresupposition it's a projection of
fantasy you know heaven is a fantasy andand I'm not denigrating fantasy by the
way and it's projected imaginativelyonto the sky and that's part of the way
you discover what's in your fantasy wellthis is us man we mediate between chaos
and order and you know those are the twoarchetypal representations fundamentally
you know and I think they apply to bothgenders you know like women can act as
the individual who holds the world onhis or her shoulders and males men can
play a maternal role you know meetfemale human beings are quite masculine
and male human beings are quite feminineand so you know maybe maybe this
archetype dominates among men and thatarchetype dominates among women which I
would say is that is the case as far asI'm concerned although there in our
individual conceptions and of coursethose two things have to work in
conjunction but that's you the eternalmediator between chaos and order which
also has its enemy so that's that'sHorace there and that Seth who's
eventually turns into Satan as though asthe West progresses so to speak and
that's represented there as well thetemptations of I would say resentment
and hatred which everyone has to fightwith all the time all right
initiations so this is cool this is astandard hero story and initiate
initiative rights are a part of humanheritage and so let's take a look this
is from el yadaI would like even now to stress the fact
that the psychopathology of the shamanicvocation is not profaned
it does not belong to ordinarysymptomatology it's not mental illness
it has an int initiatory structure andsignification
short it reproduces a traditionalmystical pattern the total crisis of the
future shaman sometimes leading tocomplete disintegration of the
personality and to madness can bevaluated not only as an initiatory death
but also as a symbolic returned to thepre cosmogonic chaos to the amorphous
and indescribable state that precedesany comes Morgan II well what he means
by that is that I suppose themythological view of the emergence of
order that's a cosmogony is that there'sa state of potential and chaos out of
which order emerges and you know here'shere's how it is that you think that way
because you do think that way so youknow imagine what you're facing when
you're facing the future right well youmight say well the future is full of
potential right it's full of potentialwhat the hell does that mean you know
you act as if that you act as if thatpotential is really a real thing and
you're confronting it all the time I'mconfronting the potential of the future
well it doesn't exist yet so did whatyou're confronting doesn't even really
exist what you're conceptualizingdoesn't really exist and in some sense
you bring it into being by plotting yourpath through it well the pre cosmogonic
chaos is the same as the potential ofthe future it's exactly the same idea
it's the realm of possibility from whichactuality emerges and you participate in
turning that possibility into actualitythat's what you're doing all the time
now can I explain that well no I have noidea how consciousness and the substrate
of the world interacti I can only say that that's how it
looks that's how it feelsyou know that's how people act and
they'll get into trouble if they don'tmanifest their potential whatever that
is that's all those things you could bethat you're not well where are those
it's just potential well that's thechaos this is a that's the I would say
that's the the cosmos that's the cosmosthat you live in all the time it's a
little story it's the thing that youextract out of the chaos it's
- consists of your conception of whereyou are now and your conception of where
you want to be at some point could beten minutes could be three years if you
can slide it and then you have a littleplan about how you should move your body
to do transform one in into the otherthat's your action powder and that's a
little story and when you ask someone tosay what they were up to you they'll
tell you a little story like that youknow I was at some place and I went
somewhere else and here's how I did itthen they might tell you more
interesting story which is I wassomeplace and something happened that I
really didn't expect and it knocked mefor a loop you know and that's a good
divorce story I came home one night andmy wife was gone it's like yeah chaos
and probably a bit of willful blindnesspreceding it we might suspect
anyways down into chaos and then wellmaybe you learn something down there and
maybe you don't but hopefully you do andyou put yourself together if you're
lucky and then pop bang you pop up intoanother little structure of order and
that's an initiatory process it's likeyou're some more stable falls apart or
maybe you break it apart on purpose youdo it voluntarily you know people do
that all the time you know they do thatfor example when they experiment with
drugs and they do that when they go onwild adventures and you know when they
break themselves out of their normalroutine and throw themselves somewhere
they don't understand and hope thatthat's going to produce a transformation
of personality that's the basic storythat's the initiatory story now this is
William James who was the one of theestablishes of modern psychology and a
kind of an odd guy he was an earlyexperimenter with psychedelics of course
they'll never tell you that but he wasand he is his drug of choice was nitrous
oxide which is an inhalant gas whichseems to be inert no one really knows
why it works but it produces quiteintense hallucinogenic experience
mystical experience although if youbreathe too much of it then you die
because it doesn't it doesn't have anyoxygen in it so so don't do that and and
he wrote some really bad hippie poetryback
in the 1880s well he was you knowexperimenting with with nitrous oxide
I'll read a little bit of that to youpure experience is the name which I give
to the original flux of life before areflection has categorized it only
newborn babes in persons in semi comafrom sleep drugs illnesses or blows can
have an experience pure in the literalsense of that which is not yet any
definite what though ready to be anysorts of what's both full both of
oneness and of many 'no specs that don'tappear changing throughout yet so
confusedly that its phasesinterpenetrate and no points either of
distinction or of identity can be caught1905 William James Journal of philosophy
you know a lot of these old guys thatestablished what we regard is you know
fairly stable bodies of knowledge we'rejust as crazy as you could possibly
imagine they're just the most peculiardamn people and they get sanitized you
know as they are represented in historyand that's no fun you know I mean it's
much more interesting to know what theywere like they were just so bloody
peculiar and and strange and involved inall sorts of weird things that's a lot
more fun to know that here's his poemWow
it's like right from 1968 no verbiagecan give it because the verbiage is
other incoherent coherent same and itfades and it's infinite and it's
infinite don't you see the differencedon't you see the identity constantly
opposites United the same me telling youto write and not to write extreme
extreme extreme something and other thanthat thing intoxication and other nest
and intoxication every attempt atbetterment every attempt at other menthe
is a it fades forever and forever as wemove it's like it's just about as
incoherent as post modernist philosophyso we know for archaic and traditional
cultures that a symbolic return to chaosis equivalent to preparing a new
creation it follows that we mayinterpret the psychic chaos of the
future shaman as assignedthe profane man is being dissolved and a
new personality being prepared for birthtransformation here's a way of thinking
about it paradiseParadise Lost redemption classic story
of mankind always it was a great pastwe're in a state of chaos we're heading
towards a better future everyone thinksthat way the stories are based on that
well that's that now Ellen Burch a whowrote a lot about the psychoanalysts
believed that Freud and Jung inparticular had a creative illness which
he regarded as a sort of spontaneousshamanic transformation and he said a
creative illness has these elements itfollow succeeds a period of intense
preoccupation with an idea and searchfor certain truth it's a polymorphous
condition that can take the shape ofdepression neurosis psychosomatic
ailments or even psychosis Jung was inthat state when he wrote this book
called the red book which was justreleased last year which is full of
visionary illustrations and hands verystrange poetry and it contains the the
communications he had with imaginativebeings that he conjured up when when
practicing doing exactly that hepracticed that for years and he had
these autonomous beings manifestthemselves in his fantasy it had long
conversations with them it just you knowwhile he was working as a doctor and
having a sane normal life and well it'skind of well it's really something
whatever the symptoms they're felt ispainful while he thought maybe he was
going mad and some people think he didif not agonizing by the subject with
alternating periods of alleviation andworsening throughout the illness the
subject never loses the thread of hisdominating preoccupation it's often
compatible with normal professionalactivity and family life but even if he
keeps to his social activitieshe's almost entirely absorbed with
himself he suffers from feelings ofutter isolation even when he has a
mentor who guides him through the ordeallike the shaman apprentice with his
master the termination is often rapidand marked by a phase of exhilaration
the subject emerges from his ordealwith a permanent Tran
formation in his personality and aconviction that he has discovered a
great truth or a new spiritual worldmany of the 19th and 20th century
figures regarded universally as greatNietzsche Darwin Dostoyevsky Tolstoy
Freud Jung were all additionallycharacterized by lengthy periods of
profound psychological unrest anduncertainty
well you don't generate a new theorywithout some birth pangs right because
your old theory has to bite the dustfirst and when your old theory bites the
dust it's like where are you you don'tknow do you know if you're gonna come up
with a new one no here's a cool thingthis is my daughter she was five years
at this pointshe was playing prince or in princess
with Julie and her three-year-old shesaid dad if we killed a dragon we could
use his skin as armorwouldn't that be a good idea I thought
hey yeah that's that's a hell of an ideakid you know you go right after the
thing that frightens you the most andyou develop something that protects you
from doing that it's like where did sheget that idea
well good work kiddo she had plenty ofdragons in her life so the following
dream was described by my daughterMikayla three years nine months old
about my son Julian one year Julian wasin the process of toilet training and
rapid speech development was having sometrouble controlling his emotions Mikayla
liked to call him babywe had several discussions about the
fact that he wasn't really a babyanymore she told me this story while I
was at the computer so I was able to getit for Batum she wasn't very happy with
the idea that he wasn't a baby anymorebecause she kind of liked the baby she
took care of that baby a lot and herlittle brain was having a hard time with
the notion that whatever that thing isnow it isn't a baby it's like well
where's my baby and believe me plenty ofmothers go through the same thing then
they attempt to keep their childrenbabies for the rest of their lives so
this is what Mikayla said the dreamJulian's eyes fell out and then he
falled into pieces I said what sort ofpieces she said Julian pieces and the
bones fall doubt too then a hole got himand there was water in it and when he
came out he was big mom Julian isn't ababy anymore no he
a big boy and a bug with legs got himout cuz bugs can swim and the whole was
in the park and it moved into thebackyard and he fall into it a tree
burned and left the hole I thought wowthat's so amazing it's like it was a it
was a shamanic transformation dream itwas like the tree that's The Tree of
Life had burnt and left a hole the kidfell into it it dissolved him right down
to his bones this little bug which wouldbe a union representation of the self
like Jiminy Cricket by the way inPinocchio the bug was the thing that was
alive that helped him through thetransformation he stepped out and now he
was big it's like that was her littlebrain conjuring up the notion of radical
transformation so this is cool I hopethis works
this is a dream that my my nephew haddid someone animated Jordan Peterson is
a clinical psychologist from theUniversity of Toronto Maya do disagree
with some of his fundamental ideas buthis thoughts and facing problems merge
with my stoic values within one of hismaps of meaning lectures he tells a true
story about a four year old boy hisnephew who for months was suffering from
terrible night terrors terrors that werewaking him up screaming this boy by the
way did have some areas of instabilityin his family life Jordan visited the
young boy's house and the boy wasrunning around dressed as an eight with
a sword a shield and a helmet at nightaim he would take a sword and shield to
bed so Jordan got speaking to him andthe boy described his dream and the
dream he's standing surrounded byknee-high Dwarfs these dwarves had beaks
and every time you would try to move thedwarfs would jump up and bait him a very
fretting scenario for a young boy and ifyou look behind all the dwarfs away in
the background there was a dragon andevery time this dragon would puff out
fire and smoke more dwarfs would becreated so there's no point fighting off
the dwarfs because more would just be meit
so Jordan tapped him and asked whatcould you do about that so the kid says
he could jump up on the Dragons head hecould poke out his eyes with a sword so
he couldn't see then they could go godown the throat to the box where the
fire came from carve a piece out of thatbox thereby destroying it and use that
piece as a sheet its shamed beforeJordan arrived was already a keynote in
life what he knew he had to do and afterthat conversation he had no more Nate
pears this is what Marcus really ismeant when he said the impediment to
action advances action what stands inthe way becomes the way he was tell not
us that we must not shy away fromproblems or shown or personal
responsibility we must be willing tosacrifice her comfort Goethe source of
her problems to solve them and then takesomething away well there you go so yeah
he was waking up screaming at night forfour weeks
that's night terrorist he couldn'treally remember what hell was going on
and there was instability and his familyhis parents got divorced soon after and
he was off to kindergarten and that waskind of destabilizing him too and so it
was fun to watch him zip around as aknight it's like you know where'd he get
that idea well you know he watched TVwatch movies see his little imagination
was aggregating the picture of the heroand then he was trying to act it out
that's what he was doing pretendingright I'm pretending to be the thing
that takes on the unknown and then hehas this amazing dream it's like it's
mind-boggling it's so sophisticated it'slike well here I am
and there's troubles everywhere andthey're biting me they're jumping up on
me and it's like a Hydra you know in theHydra you cut off a hydras head and
seven more heads grow it's like that'slife man solve one problem seven more
appear right so also that that was theDragons at the background chaos itself
and chaos kept breeding these are theevil little Dwarfs which is what it does
it's like it's one damn trouble afteranother we fight this one off fight this
one off it's like who cares the dragonthe dwarf generating machine is still
working in the background so heI asked him and that was purposeful what
could you dosee that's a leading question that
implies that there's something that hecould do he said well I take my dad that
was missing in the animation and we gowell poke the dragon's eyes out go right
down to the source of the problemextinguish it make a shield right so
that meant that he would havestrengthened his character by the
encounter so brilliant and then and Italked to his mom for months afterwards
done no more night terrors what hadhappened he identified with the
mythological hero he did identified withst. George and the dragon he identified
with that little bloody tree dwellingprimate who 20 million years ago was the
first one to drop a stick on a snake headopted the classic human mode of being
in the face of uncertainty and construedhimself as that which could prevail end
of terrors well I guess we're done E sowe're gonna do something a little
different than the syllabus todaybecause you know we got this one hour to
our problem and I really can't coverconstructionism reasonably in two hours
or one hour that was supposed to betoday
so what I'm going to do is instead iscontinue on the line that I've been
pursuing but I'm going to expand it upmore into Union psychology which is the
what we're going after afterconstructivism anyways and so I can
weave the constructivism and the depthpsychology together and it's nice to do
that because it gives you a kind of acoherent view so just so you know we're
one lecture ahead at the moment roughlyspeaking and I'll do constructivism on
Tuesday for two hours so all right so Ishowed you that anime animation I told
you about my nephew's dream which is aremarkable dream you know really it's
just amazing amazing dream and it's it'sgot this archetypal pattern you know and
the pattern is that there's a threat andworse than not that there's there are
threatsand at the back of it there is the the
fact of threat itself you see so humanbeings were so smart hey so this is so
amazing that we figured this out so youimagine well human beings are the only
creatures that can really conceive ofthe class of all threatening things
right and that's kind of why we can bepermanently anxious there's so it's sort
of annoying so you know here you are andit's safe there's no Lions here or or
anything that might prey on you but youcan think of something to be anxious
about no problem you know I'm certainyou've got some little skeleton rattling
around in your closet somewhere that'slike eating away at you and so I think
part of the reason we're so damn awakehuman beings is because we're always
anxious like and you have to be awakewhen you're anxious and the the anxiety
system actually activates your reticularactivating system and that that that
actually produces its the substrate forconsciousness if you snap a few fibers
in the back of your brain that are partof the reticulating activate reticular
activating system in a car accident orsomething you'll go into a coma and
that'll be that here you're not gettingout of it doesn't take much of an injury
either in the right place so anyways sohuman beings have been struggling with
this problem of threat foreverreally for as long as there's been life
or at least as long as there's been lifewith a nervous system and you know
that's several hundred million yearsit's a long time and of course it's easy
to you know to respond to a particularthreat think about zebras they're out
there on the veldt and there's lionseverywhere right but the zebras are like
they're calmed because there's lions aresleeping and so the zebras don't think
apparently oh my god what was going tohappen with those Lions wake up because
they don't think that way you know andthey're not going to be happy if the
lion goes into a hunting Crouch andstarts its hunting approach obviously
but it's not like the zebras arefreaking out non-stop because there are
Lions around you know so they can reactto specific threats but human beings
partly because we discovered the futurewhich was a big mistake was a big
mistakebecause the future is an uncertain place
we realized that well there isn't anythreat right now but there might well be
some tomorrow and if there isn't sometomorrow well maybe next week or next
month or next year like it's coming andso there's danger so it's the category
of danger you know and out of thecategory of danger emerged specific
threats and the dragon seems to be asymbol of it is a symbol I believe of
the ever-present fact of predatoryslightly predatory threat but our
nervous systems as they've becomecapable of abstraction have used that
underlying architecture to representmore abstract categories so it's not
it's not a predator like a dragon is nota predator because there are no dragons
but maybe a dragon is a snake and a anda crocodile and maybe a leopard and
maybe a predatory bird all mangled intoone monster because a monster is
actually technically something that'smade out of disparate parts and so it's
a good symbolic representation for theunknown as such that which lies beyond
the campfire let's say and what lurksout there and so the eternal problem is
what the hell do you do with the dragonand that also explains why the dragon
typically is a treasure garter rightbecause it's even more the problem is
even worse out therein no-man's land out there in potential
there's threat and and and like mortalthreat but there's also endless
opportunity and riches and wealth andand and the possibility of attracting
someone and all of that and so well thedragon
you can't just be afraid of it you juststay in your burrow the whole time and
lots of animals more or less do that isyou know especially the nocturnal ones
they just hide away but that is whathuman beings alight because we're not
only prey animals right we're alsopredators and then of course we're crazy
we're absolutely insane chimpanzeesright we're crazy and so we're always
out there mucking about with things andwith our you know fingers and and our
thumbs and and taking the world apartand putting it back together and we're
crazily exploratory and and introublemaking and so we don't just run
from dragons we go hunt them down and soand so there's a story here there's the
oldest story that mankind knows andliterally it is the oldest story that we
know is this stories in this storybasically is there's a bounded space a
walled garden a walled city you know onall the original cities were walled
because if they weren't barbarians wouldswoop in and they'd just steal all your
stuff and so you know that was kind ofpointless so you know you wanted to have
some major-league walls surrounding yourterritory and so that's inhabited space
and inside that is here little dominancehierarchy and so all you primates knew
exactly who was who inside that space soyou didn't have to fight with each other
and you could predict each other'sbehavior because you believed the same
things and saw the world roughly thesame way and acted the same way and so
you were sort of secure but then theproblem is is that that can always be
breached there's always somethingoutside of it that's a danger and so
that's signified by this this littlecreature here this is dragon and that
that twirl in its tail is very commonamong dragons actually it's actually a
symbol because you imagistic languagesimagistic symbols have an ancient
language and it it's referring tosomething that's basically eternal and
so it lives down here in this in thiscave because it's an underground thing
it's an underground thing and you cankind of imagine what that's like and
sometimes this happens in initiationrituals among archaic people they're
gonna when they're gonna initiateusually the young men because nature
initiates women know by itself usuallythe young men maybe they'll put them in
a cave and leave them there you know forlike well who know who knows how long
and Sagada think what's in a cave thatcaves are dark man I don't know if
you've ever been in one but like they'redark and they're really dark and so not
only is there whatever there is in thecave and you don't know what the hell's
in the cave there's whatever youimagined might be in the cave and so
when you're in that cave and you'realone you you're confronting the devils
and demons and monsters of your ownimagination you know and so then you
have a chance to perhaps deal with thatand overcome it and that's perhaps part
of the initiation ceremony you know andthat's part of growing up because you
have to learn how to face the thingsthat terrify and upset you and
and we cast them and put them backtogether we talked a little bit about
this idea of the pre cosmogonic chaosthat that Iliad it refers to and and
that's this stuff out of which order isproduced at the beginning of time and
it's also the stuff out of which youconstantly reproduce order and the young
unions the psychoanalysts especially thereally deep psychoanalysts like young
Freud was a more surface psychoanalystand that's not an insult there's some
things that Freud figured out they'reabsolutely amazing he was a precursor to
Jung for sure for Jung the hero'sjourney was the journey inside the
unconscious and that would be perhaps insome sense that the the willingness to
face everything terrible that's happenedto you and to think it through and to
articulate it and and to come to gripsperhaps with your own capacity for
malevolence that was a really importantpart of Union ideas that the first step
towards individuation which is themanifestation of your full self let's
say was the discovery of your shadow andyour shadow is the part of you that will
do terrible things under the rightcircumstances and maybe even without
that much provocation and you know andit's a terrifying part of you to come
into contact with because it's sort ofit's sort of the way that you're
specifically attached to the archetypeof evil that's a that's a good way of
thinking about it and you know modernpeople they don't really think much
about think much about the idea of goodand evil but that's because the most of
them are so they I'm naive you can justbarely even comprehend it you know if
you read any history if you really readit like and you and you don't come away
with the idea that evil exists it's likeyou're just reading the wrong kind of
history you know it's just unbelievablewhat people can do to each other and
we're so imaginative you know and one ofthe things I figured out about people
the reason that we're we have theknowledge of good and evil let's say is
that because we're self conscious and weknow about ourselves we know about our
own vulnerability right you know whathurts you you really know what hurts you
way more than an animal knows and sowhen you're all so creative and so once
you know what hurts you man you canreally hurt someone else and you can do
it in such a creative way you can drawit out you can
make it excruciating you can take peopleapart physically and psychologically and
you can keep them say even right on theedge of death so that you can keep doing
that endlessly and you know that happenshell of a lot more than you think it
happens it happens a lot and so well andyou think well you know that doesn't
involve me it's like oh yes it does manthat's the problem because you know
you're human and that's the sort ofthings that human beings are capable of
and I'm not saying you're all it's allprobable that you do that ever or or
that but I'm saying that you know yougot to take that into account when
you're looking at the world and youthink about all the perpetrators out
there it's like it's not like there'sperpetrators and there's victims that
isn't how it works it doesn't work thatway at all and so the horrors of
humanity as well as the noble elementsof humanity are all elements of your
central being and for you and this isthe terrible thing for young the pathway
to higher wisdom was through theterrible portal of well you could say
hell for that matter really in and sowho wants to do that man it's like no
you know like maybe you're resentfulabout something well you probably are
because like everybody's resentful aboutsomething you know and resentment is
just vicious emotion it's really usefulit's really useful because if you're
resentful about something it eithermeans that you should grow the hell up
and accept the responsibility and quitsniveling around and whining or it means
that someone actually is oppressing youand and pushing on you too hard and
bullying you and demeaning you and youhave something to say or do that you're
not saying or doing and no wonder you'renot saying or doing it because you know
it can be really dangerous to say thingsor do them to free yourself from from
being oppressed you can get in a lot oftrouble in the short term for doing it
so it's easier just to not say anythingsort of day after day in the short term
you protect yourself but just crushesyou and then the the resentment comes up
and resentment and that can just get soout of hand you know it starts with
resentment and then it starts it goes tothe desire for revenge
you know because you'll play nastylittle tricks on the person that's
opressing youat any chance you'll talk about them
behind their back and if they want youto do something you'll do it badly or
you'll do it grudgingly or you'll do ahalf rate job and you'll set up little
traps and you know so it puts you in apoisonous space and then if that if you
really start to dwell on that say inyour basement for three or four years
about just exactly how terrible theworld is and how that's focused on you
and how everyone's rejected you and howyou get to this point where you're
thinking that you know existence itselfis a kind of poisonous endeavor and that
the best thing for you to do is go outthere and do as much you know create as
much mayhem as you possibly can and ifyou really get to a dark place you think
I'm going to create as much mayhem as Ipossibly can by targeting the most
innocent thing I can possibly imagineand then you end up shooting kids in
Connecticut and that's how you get thereand so that's a bad road man there's
dark things down there but you can gothere and people do and they go through
the hole of resentment and so resentmentcan tell you you've got something to say
you bloody well better say it you've gota free yourself from what's oppressing
you you have to stand up for thatbecause otherwise you become oppressed
and then once you're oppressed that'sjust not so good and so like in your
marriage and your relationships you gotto tell people what you're thinking you
don't have to assume you're right that'sa whole different story because you're
not cuz you're you know ignorant andyou're biased and you know so you're not
right but you can stumble towards yourthis the expression of yourself and then
you can listen to the other person andhope that they tell you some way that
you're stupid that's useful so you canbe a little less stupid in the future
because that wouldn't that be good andso you know you go after the unknown you
don't protect what you know you alreadyknow what you know you go after what you
don't know that's why you have to talkto people you don't agree with that's
where you have to talk to your enemiesbecause they're gonna tell you things
you don't know you could even listen tothem it's possible they know a thing or
two you don't know but people don't likethat you know they just talk to people
who think the same way and then theyjust stay stupid and so that's and
that's notbecause if you're not wise the world
will wallop you it'll flatten you andand far more than it has to and then
you'll be better and resentful andyou'll be part of that force that
Wallops instead of the force that fightsagainst that so well so you go after the
dragon and that's what that's what thisguy is doing he's going after the dragon
it's it's threatening the societybecause it always does chaos what's
outside of order always threatens orderalways always and so you have to step
forward you know in this mannervoluntarily and and and go after that
when it's still manageable right andthat's the case in your own life too so
you know if you're if you've had aproclivity to be bullied in the past you
know and you want to get out of thatwhat you have to do is you have to make
yourself awake to the to the Maite tothe to the what would you say to the to
the initial stages of that sort ofbullying emerging in your life again
that sort of domination and you have tostep forward against it when it's still
in its developing stages because maybeyou can just not have it happen that
would be better and so you have to beready to speak what you have to say more
or less at a moment's notice you can'tbe impulsive about it you know like if
you and I are talking and you make amistake or I make a mistake
even if it's bothers one or the other ofus we should just write it off because
it's like one encounter what the hellyou you know maybe we had a bad night's
sleep or something you know you gotta bea little forgiving and what if it
happens twice then you know you shouldbe a little awake and you should
remember both times and then if ithappens a third time it's like that's
when you that's when you act and you saylook we talked and this happened and I
thought yeah whatever and but then youdid it again
and then you just did it again well thenthe person is basically like what are
they gonna do you know no well maybethey might argue with you but you kind
of got them and you're generally if youjust point that out to people just like
that just that you noticed and they'rewilling to say something about it
they'll back the hell off they'll oftenapologize and sometimes you even make
them a little more conscious which islike hey that's
not such a bad idea that's what all thismeans and so this caught this chaos idea
it's so for young it was the unconsciousright it was the contents of your
unconscious and so that might be theunknown past the threatening past that
you have never dealt with there might bethe threatening future it might be the
threatening present but you realized ashis as he got older that that the
unconscious was also the world and youthink and so the chaos is not only your
unconscious mind which meets the unknownbut it's actually the unknown itself
mingled together you think what the helldoes that that's why the dragon is a
land creature and an air creature it'smatter and spirit at the same time and
this sort of gets us into constructivismbecause the constructivist think that
basically what happens is that youencounter those elements of the world
that don't fit into your theory and outof those new elements you make the world
through your perceptions and you makeyourself by incorporating the
information and transforming yourselfand that's how Piaget explains the
development of a child if the childstarts out with some reflexes basic
reflexes and manifesting the reflexesproduces results in the world and then
the child has to reorganize itsperceptions to take into account the
transformations and so then it it gets alittle more sophisticated and then it
can do a few more things and then it canmanifest more changes in the world and
then it martyr it attracts them andmodifies its perceptions and actions to
account for them and it just keeps doingthat that's how the child boots itself
up like a computer does it's a very coolidea and so from from the Piaget Gian
stance so it's constructive the stanceyou could think of the world as a latent
pool of information it's something likethat with a structure obviously that you
can interact with with your littlefingers in your body and your mind and
your eyes and your mouth and you makechanges happen and you track them and
you model them and you build your skillsand as you continue to do that in the
safety of your house initially under thecare of your parents who who fill in
where you're ignorant you you you justemerge more and more competent and
confident and ready to move ahead sothat's that's how the constructivist
idea works and so so there's kind of achaos idea at the bottom of that which
is that out of which you emerge and theworld emerges at the same time because
you know you don't see reality not atall you see almost like an animated
version of reality you know like when Ilook at you I just see the front of you
I just see the outside of you I see youat this height I don't see any of your
internal structure I don't see the theback part of you at all I don't see your
family I don't see your history I don'tsee your future you know I just see this
slice of you you're so complicated Ijust see this little like oversimplified
slice of you right now and I thinkthat's the reality that's it's it's sort
of the reality the way that the Simpsonsa Simpsons character is you it's like
it's sort of like you and it's enough sothat you can watch the story but the
real you man god only knows what that isand that's a union idea you know that
the real you is something that radicallytranscends your perception of yourself
or your conception of yourself and thatyou get to that higher you at least in
part by going into the darkest place andso it's a hell of an idea man it's
really but it's the old idea ofinitiation it's as old as time that idea
and and there's something to it and wedefinitely recreate it in psychotherapy
like this isn't an airy theory it'squite the contrary because what you do
and as a psychologist always always abehaviorist say that the most the most
logical clinical type of psychologists abehaviorist is it an initiatory shaman
even though he or she doesn't know itbecause what they do is they say okay
well let's take a look at your life likeokay you got a bunch of problems and
they're like massive dragons and you'rejust like you're not going anywhere with
those problems you're just cowering inthe corner and what the behavioral
therapist does is cut them cut thatdragon into those little Dwarfs until
the dwarfs are small enough so that youcan really kick the hell out of them and
so and that by the way they do that isthey they take the problem and they
decompose it into elements that aresmall enough that you have a reasonable
probability of mastering them so youtake that problem apart into into its
micro problems careful carefulprocess and then you think okay well how
could we progress a little bit this weekand some of that is to face to practice
facing things you're afraid of so likeif you're a graphic and you can't get on
an elevator you can't get on a taxi andyou can't stand up to your husband and
I'm saying husband because mostagoraphobic sar women most of them are
middle-aged women and most of them weretoo dependent for most of their life so
that's a monsterit's like society husband elevator taxi
subway it's a monster and it's thatplace you will not go and that's because
you feel this high and everything elselooks this big and so and partly that's
because you've run away and when you runaway from something it grows and chases
you which is well it's exactly whathappens to a prey animal man if you go
in the woods and you find a bearespecially a grizzly well you're in real
trouble if it's a grizzly but if it's ablack bear you know generally speaking
if you stand your ground and make a hellof a lot of noise that thing will leave
you alone but if you run well what's itsupposed to think it eats things that
run from it so that's exactly where thatidea came to come from you turn tail and
run and then the thing that you'reafraid of is really a monster and it's
gonna like get you and eat you it's likewell that's true psychologically as well
and and the same circuits that we use towhen we were you know out in the forest
even even in trees the same circuitsthat we used to parse up the world then
into safe territory and place where thepredators loom is the way we parse up
the world now which is safe territoryand the place where the predators loom
it's just become abstracted way upabstracted way up so but it's the same
damn circuits it's we know this like thesame circuits you used to forage for
informationit's a dopaminergic circuit is the
circuit that squirrels use to forage fornuts and you think well why well it's
because there's no difference betweeninformation and food like you trade
information for food all the time that'swhat you're doing when you're working
especially if you're working on acomputer so the idea that there's
there's an equation between informationand food it's like well obviously
obviously there's an equation betweenthem so of course you'd use the same
and I mean the damn squirrel has toremember where the nuts are and so for
him information is food even so whenwhat happened to human beings is that we
started thinking hey maybe it's betterto go after information than it is to go
after food because going afterinformation produces more food than just
going after food and so that was apretty damn smart idea so we're still
doing that so anyways this is whatyou're supposed to be doing and so and
this is what behavior therapists do theydecompose your problems what are you
afraid of well okay you're afraid ofeverything well let's get something
specific you're afraid ofwell I'm afraid of an elevator okay an
elevator so I have a client she's afraidof elevators the elevator door open she
goes that's a tomb and I thought oh wowI thought it was an elevator but for you
it's not a bloody elevatorit's death and so that's what you're
afraid of it's worse than that you'reafraid of being trapped inside there in
the dark alone alone not knowing ifanyone is going to rescue you stuck
there with your damn imaginationfreaking out it's like and if that's not
and then maybe you have a heart attacksbecause you're so terrified and you die
it's like you know so that's theelevator
well it's no bloody wonder there noone's gonna get into something like that
and then maybe underneath that is yourdistrust in the mechanisms of society
right because you know a normal personthose weird creatures they'll get an
elevator what the hell they don't careand partly it's because they have an
implicit belief even if the thing stopssomebody will come along and rescue them
and usually you don't even think aboutit right it's like no what the hell it's
an elevator it's like the danger isinvisible to you and it's partly because
you implicitly trust the structure andso maybe you go into the unconscious
presuppositions of the person who isterrified of the elevator in the subways
and you find out they have a realproblem with trusting Authority that's
partly why they don't get along withtheir husband why they've never been
able to stand up for themselves so thenyou say okay well you're afraid of the
damn elevator but it's not an elevatorit's a tomb and the tomb is partly you
and partly it's partly the elevator andpartly your unconscious mind and so well
what can you handle can you go look atan elevator from
and feet away it's like yes okay howabout 9 feet away yes 5 feet yes 4 feet
no okay no problem four and a half feetwe're gonna go from that elevator we're
gonna look at the damn thing untilyou're bored of it because that's what
we're trying to you should be bored ofthe elevator because then you're not
afraid of it obviously it's like it's anelevator you just don't notice it right
all these things around here that youdon't notice I take you out of here and
ask you what color the walls are youhaven't got any idea you know yeah I
suspect for most of you there's not achance you'd be able to identify the
gender of the person who's sitting nextto you unless you know them it's like
you just don't remember anything and whyshould you everything works like you
don't have to pay attention to it it'slike is that staying up yeah it's still
up yeah still up still up if it's likereally no you know you get bored of that
real quick and so then you just ignoreit and but the agoraphobic has had that
veil of ignorance torn away and whatthey see behind it is mortal threat and
so that's really what you're helpingthem deal with and so this week there
are four and a half feet from theelevator next week they're a foot from
the elevator and the week after that thehorrible gates of Hell open and they
look inside and they don't run and sohey they're tougher than they thought
they were and that's what you'reteaching them actually you're not
teaching them that the world isn'tdangerous because that's a stupid thing
to teach someone bloody right the worldis dangerous it's terrifying and
sometimes people under they realize thatand the veil lifts and they see horror
everywhere they see that and then theythink well I'm just a little rabbit I'm
over here in the cornerI can't move I'm petrified and then they
can't move they hide it home they cowerat home because everything has become a
predatory domain and so what you teachthem is you're not as much of a rabbit
as you think and part of that is thatyou help them grow some teeth so that
they can go home and have that fightwith their husband that they should have
had 25 years ago and it happens veryfrequently with agra phobic clients that
you get them so they can go on the damnelevator and they can go on the subway
and they can take a taximaybe they learn to drive Wow they get
some autonomy and then they're a littletougher and so then they can stand up
from loot for themselves and they goback and like their husband might not be
very happy with any of this really itdepends on what sort of guy he is you
know if he's a real tyrant he might bejust perfectly happy that he's married
to someone who you know was afraid ofher own shadow because then she won't
ever leave and so that's a nasty littlestory and believe me it's not uncommon
so she gets tougher by facing what shefears and what she finds out is there's
a hell of a lot more to her than shethought and that's really what happens
when you do behavior therapy withsomeone who's agoraphobic it isn't
really that they get less afraid it'sthat they get braver that's way
different it's because brave is alertand able to cope naive is there's no
danger it's like hell yeah right there'sno danger Jesus what a stupid theory
that is so anyways that's what all thisis that's that's the story man and it's
a it's a major story it's the story ofhuman transformation and growth it's the
evolution of mankind it's like it's amajor story and we've been working on
the damn thing for like god only knowshow long you know snakes and primates
co-evolved and our vision are sharpsharp sharp vision seems to have been an
evolutionary adaptation forced on us bythe presence of predatory snakes and
we're talking tens of millions of yearsago and human beings have unbelievably
sharp eyesight the only thing that canout see us is birds of prey and they
have eyes like an eagle a bald eagle haseyes as big as ours and it has two
phobias that phobia is the central partof the vision so an eagle is all eyes
man and so but human beings we're kindof like that too and like half our brain
is devoted to visual processing we haveacute vision in Madagascar where there
are primates with no predatory snakesthere are lemurs they can't see worth a
damn and I'm a anthropologist named LynnIsabelle did a comprehensive study
worldwide trying to account for theacuity of primate vision and what she
found was that the more predatory snakesin the vicinity the sharper the eyesight
of the primatesand so we have a really sharp eyesight
so that means a lot of us were eaten bysnakes and none of your ancestors
fortunately because otherwise youwouldn't be here but a lot of those who
fell by the wayside were snake snack andyou know when you're little and living
in a tree a snake is no damn joke andeven now lots of people get bitten by
snakes and people are phobic of snakesat quite a rate and some of that
actually seems innate there's argumentsabout cycle between psychologists about
this but even the ones who don't acceptthe fact that it's innate accept the
fact that you can make someone afraid ofa snake by conditioning just like that
we're trying to make them afraid of aflower by conditioning is really really
hard so we're at least at minimumprepared to be afraid of snakes minimum
and I believe it's I don't I believethis fear is actually an 8 although you
can learn to control itso anyways so that's that story and like
what a story man it's an amazing amazingstory you see the the den of the dragon
here is littered with skulls and bonesthat's what that is so either thing is
no joke it's like look the hell out andthat's this you know and look it up at
the top right hand corner there you knowthat's from Peter Pan right well you
remember Captain Hook we talked abouthim already he's a tyrant and he's a
tyrant because he's afraid of death andthat's all he sees in life and so it
makes him cruel and better and death hasalready taken part of him right that's
why he has a hook and that damncrocodiles chasing him tick tick all the
time and of course that's the samesituation you're all in man there was a
crocodile with a clock at its stomachchasing you and it could easily turn you
into a tyrant it can turn you into atyrant or a cowering victim or a hero
those are the options fundamentally soand that's the Gorgon looking at her own
the Medusa looking at her own reflectionyou know mother nature with a head full
of snakes you know a terrifying visionand that's actually to some degree an
archetype that men get confused withwomen and you know that's the witchy
part of women and that's the part that'sattractive attractive attractive but
rejecting rejecting rejecting it so manymen are petrified by women they won't
approach them at all they have no ideahow to talk to them they're just
petrified intoand that's way more common than you
think and so that breeds resentment likeyou wouldn't believe you know you hear
the guy who shot up like Dawson Collegeit's like what the hell do you think
motivated him it's like he that's whathe saw and and it was because well he
was my opinion is he was too goddamnuseless to be attractive to anyone and
so that's a hell of a place to be inyou know it's then that's the problem
too if you're chronically rejected bypeople it's often because of your own
insufficiencies you know whether that'scowardice or lack of social skills or
whatever it is it's like you can't justbrush it off as oh well you know no one
likes me but really I'm okay it's likeno no wrong if everyone rejects you
there's probably something wrong andit's probably deep and difficult and
it's going to be horrible to fix and soit's this isn't a trivial problem it's
not a trivial problem at all and so youknow that's mother nature for man too
because from from the sexual selectionpoint of view if they if they're not
selected as a mate Nature has taken themout of the game right and so you know
people don't really like that they'renot that happy with that and so but
getting all whiny about it and thengetting violent it's like that's just
not all not really very helpful althoughit's very common so this is Lyndon
Isabel an evolutionary arms race betweenearly snakes and mammals triggered the
development of improved vision and largebrain in primates a radical new theory
suggests these are old representations Ireally like this one this is I don't
rememberI think it's Greek but it doesn't
exactly look Greek it might be olderit doesn't matter anyways you see it's
the same thing same ideas as Graham'sdream right it's like there's this thing
that exists this this multi headed snakeand it's got this infinity problem it's
everywhere that's that little circledown there and the problem is well what
do you do with it you cut off one headseven more growth that's the eternal
problem of life and the problem is therethere there is the category of problems
in life and it ain't going anywhere andso the question is can you deal with the
whole category at the same timethat's the thing that's how to be in the
world is to deal with that category allat the same time and so how did how did
human beings what did they come up withas a solution and that's so cool too
because the solution they come up withnot only was the heroism that allows you
to approach what you're terrified by andwhat you find offensive and to learn
from it but also the idea of sacrificeand and that was played out by cultures
everywhere including human sacrifice andyou think what the hell was up with
those crazy bastards so long ago theywere sacrificing two gods all the time
what kind of clueless behavior was thatburned something and please God burn
something valuable and please God it'slike what was with them what were they
thinking well they weren't stupid thosepeople if they were stupid we wouldn't
be here they were not stupid and believeme they lived under a lot harsher
conditions than we do so those were sometough people man you know back then
you'd last about 15 minutes and so youdon't want to be thinking of your
ancestors as stupid like there's no realevidence that we're much different
cognitively than we were a hundred andfifty thousand years ago
so anyways sacrifice what does that meansacrifice well it's a discovery man it's
the discovery of the future it's likethe future is actually the place where
there is threat and it's always gonna bethere so what do you do you make
sacrifices in the present so that thefuture is better right everyone does
that that's what you're doing right nowthat's what you're doing here that's
what your parents are doing when theypay money to send you to university they
think you can bargain with reality it'samazing you can bargain with reality you
can forestall gratification now andit'll pay off it at a place in time that
doesn't even exist yet it's like whowould have believed that it's like
that's a miracle that that occurs andit's not like people just figured that
overnight you know we were chimps forChrist's sake like how are we gonna come
up with an idea like that well it's likewell we thought about it for seven
million years and you know we got to thepoint where we could kind of act it out
but we didn't know what we were doingbut it was a merge it's like a dream it
wasso the terror of the future is a dream
and the solution to the terror the dreamof the terror of the future is another
dream and and it comes out in mythologyand in fantasy and in drama where you
act out the sacrifice and then it's astep on the way to full understanding so
we can say sacrifice now instead ofdoing it you know although we still do
it it's just not concretize like it usedto be we do it abstractly and we all
have faith that it will work you knowand we also set up our society so that
it'll work and one thing about you knowI'm not a fan of moral relativism for a
variety of reasons partly because Ithink it's an it's an extreme form of
cowardice but anyways apart from that nono no no there's minimal ways that you
can set up a society that will work andso one of them is is that the society
has to be set up so that your sacrificeswill pay off or you won't work and then
the society will die and so it has tomake promises people have to make
promises to one another and that's whatmoney is money is a promise that your
sacrifice will pay off in the futurethat's what money is and so if the
society is stable you can store up yourwork right now you can sacrifice your
impulses and you can work and you canstore up credit for the future and then
you can make the future a better placebut Society has to be stable enough to
allow for that hyperinflation will doyou in so the promise that's implicit in
the currency is the promise that whatyou're doing now will pay off in the
future and if people don't have thatpromise then well we know what they do
because in in gangs for example and saygangs in North America the time horizon
of the gang members shrinks rapidlybecause they don't really expect to be
alive at much past 21 and so they getreally impulsive and violent and like
why the hell not that's that's what youdo when when the future doesn't matter
when it's not real you you default backto living in the moment and you take
what you can get right now and no wonderbecause you don't know if you're gonna
be around you know in a year and you getwhatever you can well you can bloody
well get it and that's like anarchy thatstate and so
you don't want to live and some peoplelike to live in that state because
they're really wired for that you knowand so they're they're much more
comfortable in those conditions therethey're kind of like warrior types I
would say in some sense but you know formost people that's just where that
stress will just do you in you know thestress of a life like that so that's a
pretty horrible picture the one on theright I think and you know it's it's a
creepy picture and don't you thinkdoesn't it seems like a creepy picture
to me yeah and so that's quetzel a codelif I remember correctly who's me who is
an Aztec dragon God and that's the Eyeof Horus by oh by the way this little
thing here and that see the Egyptiansthey worship the eye
yeah well that's cool because well whydid they worship the eye well wake the
hell up and look at the world that'syour salvation to do that pay bloody
attention especially to the things youdon't want to pay attention to and use
your vision have some vision and you canuse your vision to see into the future
and that is your that's your Redemptionand the Egyptians they didn't know how
to say that but they knew how torepresent it and that's how they
represented it like the pupil on that iscompletely open completely dilated and
that's a God as far as the Egyptianswe're concerned it's Horus and I'll tell
you Horus a story at some point so earlyprimates developed a better eye for
color detail and movement and theability to see in three dimensions
traits that are important for detectingthreats at close range humans are
descended from these same primates allright
so now the initiation when you go intopsychotherapy or when you make any
supreme moral effort which is roughlythe same thing you have to confront that
which you do not know now I mentionedthe called prima cosmogonic chaos and
the idea that at the end of Jung's lifehe sort of thought of the unconscious
and the world as the same and you thinkwhat the hell does that mean but here's
what it means so let's say you're in along-term intimate relationship and you
get betrayed okay so what is it that yousee when you see your partner at the
moment you know of the betrayal well yousee the pre
maganda chaos and here's why well itrattles your unconscious up because you
don't know anything anymore you don'tknow what the past was right you don't
know what it was and it's supposed to bereal and all of a sudden you don't know
what it was and so you come up with wildideas about what it might have been and
what it represented and then you don'tknow what the future is gonna be anymore
so then your fantasy fills that spaceand you don't know who the hell you're
looking at that's for sure and you don'tknow much about human beings and you
certainly don't know anything aboutyourself
and so all of a sudden not only iseverything in chaos inside your mind but
everything is in chaosin your world and it actually is and
there's no telling the differencebetween those two things you know and so
then they you're just shattered and sothen you go talk to a therapist for like
two years and you think what happenedwhat was the reality and the reality is
because who knows what the reality waslike but as far as you're concerned the
reality is I better represent thisproperly in my head I better figure out
who I was who that person was what wedid together and what it meant because I
do not want this to happen again and soyou're healed
when you get to the point where you'vegrasped the bloody moral of the story
what went wrong and how can I not havethat happen again
because that's the purpose of learningright that's the purpose of memory it's
to prepare you for the future and so youhave to pull out of that massive chaos a
functional representation that increasesyour wisdom so that you're not this
naive target the next time you enterinto a relationship so at least you can
have another relationship without beingso traumatized that you know you you're
done and you know it can take peopleyears to talk that through because this
landscape of potential opens up whenwhen they're betrayed it's like well
anything could have been the truth wellyou to sort through that you have to
wander through all that mess and it'sreally painful and and emotional as well
you have to sort through all that messto come out with the new you right there
renewed you and sowell this is a representation of it this
is how people act this out by butwhatever method he may have been
designated the shaman is recognized assuch as only after having received two
methods of instruction the first isecstatic dreams trances and visions the
second is traditional shamanictechniques names and functions of the
spirit mythology and genealogy of theclan and the secret language well one of
the things that happens this happens toyou even if if you encounter something
terrible like a betrayal what happens isthat you have to take a journey into the
domain of morality essentially which ishow did I act and how did that person to
act and how should have they acted andhow should have I acted and so and
that's part of your cultural structureand so that's the idea of rescuing the
dead farther from the depths right andthat's what we'll show you some examples
of that so this is a critical issue withregards to the shamanic transformation
is that people go through these terribleterrible experiences often drug-induced
by the way with regards to the shamanthey usually use psychedelic chemicals
of one form another often mushrooms butbut they've come up with some very
strange concoctions like ayahuasca downin the Amazon and ayahuasca is an
amazing substance it's made out of thebark of one thing and another plant
whose name I don't remember that hardlyeven grow in the same place and that
have to be cooked together in a specialway and no one has any idea how the damn
Amazonians figured that out it looksimpossible and if you ask them they say
well the plants told us how to do itwhich you know Western people don't find
very helpful but the shamans areperfectly helped happy with that that
description in ayahuasca takes themapart and it does that in part because
its effects the serotonergic system veryvery powerfully like all psychedelics do
and it transports them to another worldand that's how they interpret it and and
and and what we know about psychedelicsyou could put in a thimble and then
throw the thimble away we know nothingabout psychedelics there's new
experiments going on at Johns Hopkinsfor example with psilocybin which is
part of this active chemical in magicmushrooms same structure basically as
LSD and mescalineall the real psychedelics have basically
the same structure except the one that'sderived from Amanita muscaria which is
called muscarinic acid and it's a it'sits own weird thing that no one knows
anything about anyways they haveprofound neuro chemical effects in very
small doses and the research group atJohns Hopkins has given psilocybin to
research subjectsyou know purified psilocybin because
they started the new experimentationwith psychedelics and that's been banned
for like 40 yearsbecause psychedelics were so terrifying
to our culture that we just put themaway it's like oh no we're not going
there and so even from a researchperspective and even though some of the
psychedelics look very promising for thetreatment of disorders like alcoholism
they recently used psilocybin to helppeople stop smoking down at Johns
Hopkins and I think they had an 80%success rate which is just like that's
just absolutely mind-bogglingand so but if you give people psilocybin
and they have a mystical experiencewhich is very common among people who
take these sorts of chemicals then theirpersonality transforms permanently such
that one year later their one standarddeviation higher in openness and
openness is the creativity dimension andthat seems to be a permanent
transformation so that's reallyremarkable and about 80 percent of the
people who undergo the Johns Hopkinsexperiments report that the experience
is like one of the two or three mostimportant things they've ever that's
never ever happened to them and so wellthat's that's something you know it's
like and then there's this guy namedRick Strassman down at I think he was at
the University of Texas and he didexperimentation with DMT and DMT
dimethyltryptamine I remember I remembercorrectly is the active ingredient in
ayahuasca and you produce it in yourbrain and it's in plants it's like a
very common chemical but DMT is a weirdhallucinogen because it has an
extraordinarily short mechanism ofaction it's like and people who take it
report that they're blasted out of theirbody like out of a cannon and then they
go out somewhere and encounter beings ofvarious sorts and then ten minutes later
they're back and virtually everyonereports that which is really strange and
and so strassman was giving people DMTintravenously so that the trip
would last longer he this was all allyou know nih-funded
experimentation all cleared with therelevant ethics boards all conducted
within the last 10 years and hebasically quit doing it because he was a
pretty straight scientist you know hewas measuring heart rate and pulse and
all that sort of thing trying to look atthe physiology and then the people he
was giving these chemicals to keptcoming back and telling him these these
crazy stories and well it just it wastoo much for him you know and no wonder
you know cuz they all said the samething and he'd say well that was a dream
and they'd say no and it was the mostreal thing that ever happened to me and
he'd say well you know it's anarchetypal experience and they'd say no
no no that was no archetypal experienceI went somewhere else and I saw things
and I'm back and like I don't care whatyou think and like who the hell knows
right because it's all subjective butbut the weird thing about it is that
everyone's reporting the same thing howthe hell do you account for that and
then the shaman you know when they takethese psychedelic chemicals they
basically say the same thing they saywell first of all it more or less killed
me that's this you know i dissolved twoskeleton and then I climbed the tree
that unites heaven and earth and I wentinto the realm of the gods and they gave
me some information and I'm back it'slike okay well you know we don't really
know what to make of that and we andcertainly that's what Elia describes
when he describes the shamanic theshamanic procession not the shamanic
initiation and you know there'sdissolution to a skeleton first and then
like a death the symbolic death orexperienced as an actual death and then
bang up into the realm of the gods andthen they come back there's a very old
idea and that's a medievalrepresentation of the tunnel that people
travel through at the end of their lifeto you know to find the light which is a
very common near-death experience reportand people don't have any idea what the
hell to do with those reports except saywell it's the paroxysm zuv the dying
brain which you'd expect to be a hell ofa lot more random in my opinion and the
idea is there's a rebirth after that andyou know here this is the Scandinavian
representation of that tree that unitesearth with heaven and so there's the
Scandinavian representation it has asnake snakes down here eating it and
and that's the amazonian representationit's like how the hell he account for
that I mean those those pictures are sosimilar that it's just it's beyond
belief well you know we lived in treesfor a long time a long long long long
time millions of years and there werelots of snakes around them and so the
idea that reality is a tree that'ssurrounded by a snake is that's in us
man it's down there it's deep andthere's something about it that's true
now not true like we normally think oftruth a truth true in an entirely
different manner so and all that'spretty damn strange we'll stop with this
my son drew this when he was seven yearsold blew me away man I thought it was so
cool so I had it laminated and so hereis what it is on the right hand side
that's ordered it's like the yin-yangthing that's order left-side chaos right
and those are all mushroom houses whichI thought was amazing and then there's
this river that runs right down themiddle like the line for order and chaos
and then there's this tree that goes upto heaven and that's heaven up there
it's like there st. Peter there's thepearly gates there's the clouds it's
like it's he never went to church youknow it's like what the hell and then
there's a little bug there that goes upand down from heaven to earth and that
was him and I thought he had a veryorganized psyche that kid he was a very
very stable kid and still is and I hedrew that and I thought Jesus that's
just bloody will unbelievable and Istill think that when I look at it and
that's a great example of an archetypeand so we'll see you Tuesday
you
