<p begin="00:00:04.790" end="00:00:09.450" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to tell you today about a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.740" end="00:00:11.940" style="s2">way of looking at the world that I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:14.630" style="s2">is substantially different from the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.940" end="00:00:17.490" style="s2">that most people look at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.630" end="00:00:19.650" style="s2">the way I want to tell you about looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">at the world today is I think more</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.650" end="00:00:22.980" style="s2">inclusive than a standard sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:24.510" style="s2">materialist view of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.980" end="00:00:27.210" style="s2">scientific view of the world of course</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.510" end="00:00:29.310" style="s2">is that it&#39;s made up of familiar objects</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.210" end="00:00:32.690" style="s2">and if the world is in essence a</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.310" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">material place but there&#39;s some very</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.690" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">potent limitations of that viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">despite the fact that it&#39;s given us</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:45.770" style="s2">tremendous power and the limitations are</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">essentially as follows the essential</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.770" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">materialist view can&#39;t tell us anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:53.899" style="s2">about consciousness which is probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">the primary fact of experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.899" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">neuroscientists in recent years mostly</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">in the last decade of being trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">crack the problem of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:05.880" style="s2">they have absolutely made no progress</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:07.950" style="s2">they&#39;ve tried to associate consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:09.869" style="s2">with neuronal activity but that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.950" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">be an incomplete answer because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.869" end="00:01:12.840" style="s2">many forms of neuronal activity in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">brain that aren&#39;t accompanied by</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.840" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">consciousness at all not only do</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">neuroscientists understand virtually</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">nothing about consciousness they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">even really figure out what its function</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">is they can&#39;t understand why our brains</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">would go to so much effort to make us</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">aware of things when it isn&#39;t clear at</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">all that awareness is necessary for life</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">especially given that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">life forms on the planet that don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">to be aware at all the standard</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">materialist view is also insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">many other ways it&#39;s insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">philosophically I think as you probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">all know because a conception that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:50.030" style="s2">portrays the world is made up of objects</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">is in some really fundamental way dead</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.030" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">alright it doesn&#39;t seem to have a place</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.140" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">in it for human beings or replacing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:01:58.229" style="s2">for meaning or a mode whereby you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">be able to conceptualize the real</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.229" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">existence of something like an emotion</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">or a dream or a motivation all phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">which are just as mysterious to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">neuroscientists and to scientists in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">general as consciousness now the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">with this seems to be mostly</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">oriental if you have to ask people what</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:20.550" style="s2">they know more than anything else they</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:23.489" style="s2">know number one that they&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.550" end="00:02:26.190" style="s2">they know number two that their internal</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.489" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">experience of life is composed of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.190" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">emotions and motivational states which</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:33.270" style="s2">although not rational and essential</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:35.069" style="s2">structure are so real and relevant that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.270" end="00:02:37.470" style="s2">virtually everything that people do is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.069" end="00:02:38.900" style="s2">predicated on them so our current</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.470" end="00:02:41.580" style="s2">viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.900" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">despite its ability to give us</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.580" end="00:02:47.100" style="s2">tremendous technological power seems to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.980" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">eradicate from formal consideration many</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.100" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">many essential experiences that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">vital to life in fact even perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">primary nope</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">I&#39;m going to suggest to you today that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">there&#39;s an alternative viewpoint and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">think also it&#39;s one that although you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:03.780" style="s2">may be hearing about it formally for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:08.069" style="s2">first time is also something that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.780" end="00:03:08.910" style="s2">know unbelievably deeply how thousands</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.910" end="00:03:14.040" style="s2">Plato proposed that all knowledge was</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:15.569" style="s2">remembering of course we don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.040" end="00:03:17.340" style="s2">that today because we believe we gather</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.569" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">knowledge as a consequence of contact</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.340" end="00:03:20.700" style="s2">with the world but you&#39;ll see today that</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:22.799" style="s2">the knowledge that I&#39;m going to share</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.700" end="00:03:24.299" style="s2">with you will strike a deep chord of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.799" end="00:03:25.859" style="s2">remembering and it&#39;s because everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.299" end="00:03:28.380" style="s2">that you&#39;ve done throughout your life is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.859" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">in one way or another predicated on what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.380" end="00:03:32.609" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you today I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">demonstrate this in a peculiar way I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.609" end="00:03:36.450" style="s2">think because I&#39;m going to start by</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">telling you a story and the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.450" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">going to do that is because models of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:42.750" style="s2">the world that include phenomena like</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:44.549" style="s2">consciousness and emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">motivations and actions and interactions</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.549" end="00:03:50.700" style="s2">are generally portrayed formally in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:53.220" style="s2">stories and not in scientific theories</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.700" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">and it does turn out to be that stories</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.220" end="00:03:57.209" style="s2">themselves have an identifiable</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:04:00.030" style="s2">structure even a grammar that makes them</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.209" end="00:04:01.950" style="s2">comprehensible furthermore it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.030" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">that even the simplest stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.950" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re elegantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2">constructed have an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:10.769" style="s2">profound underlying meaning and you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">frequently see this most particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.769" end="00:04:15.329" style="s2">children&#39;s stories so I remember I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:17.850" style="s2">showed my son when he was four years old</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.329" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">the Disney movie Pinocchio which on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.850" end="00:04:22.770" style="s2">surface of it is a very strange tale</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s a wooden puppet who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.770" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">become real so he has to rescue his</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:29.170" style="s2">father</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:31.240" style="s2">in the belly of a whale a structure that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.170" end="00:04:33.880" style="s2">could by no means be considered rational</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.240" end="00:04:35.650" style="s2">that is in fact so surprising and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.880" end="00:04:37.270" style="s2">unexpected that it&#39;s remarkable to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.650" end="00:04:40.030" style="s2">imagine that grown men and women</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.270" end="00:04:42.220" style="s2">including children can sit in a movie</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.030" end="00:04:44.230" style="s2">theater and watch a story like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.220" end="00:04:46.540" style="s2">unfold without ever thinking for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.230" end="00:04:48.760" style="s2">second that it&#39;s absolutely peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.540" end="00:04:52.950" style="s2">that they can be taken in by such a tale</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">and regard it experientially as real</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.950" end="00:04:57.700" style="s2">Pinocchio is a deep deep story it has</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:04:59.080" style="s2">echoes that go back three or four</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.700" end="00:05:00.760" style="s2">thousand years to the earliest stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.080" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">that we know and it&#39;s so rich with</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.760" end="00:05:05.590" style="s2">information that a child can watch it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:08.500" style="s2">over and over and over and over I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.590" end="00:05:11.380" style="s2">my son wants Pinocchio thirty times why</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.500" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">well it&#39;s either because a child can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.380" end="00:05:15.880" style="s2">tell the difference between fantasy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">reality or it&#39;s because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.880" end="00:05:19.540" style="s2">something to those stories that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:21.370" style="s2">more potent than we actually consciously</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.540" end="00:05:24.040" style="s2">understand it&#39;s kind of interesting too</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.370" end="00:05:27.190" style="s2">you know if you go to a sort of video</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.040" end="00:05:29.139" style="s2">rental establishment you&#39;ll find that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.190" end="00:05:31.540" style="s2">the top ten highest grossing movies of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.139" end="00:05:33.580" style="s2">all time are for Disney movies that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.540" end="00:05:35.650" style="s2">animated fairy tales essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.580" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">retelling of mythological stories they</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.650" end="00:05:42.280" style="s2">strike a deep chord why all Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:45.160" style="s2">was of course a great literary figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.280" end="00:05:47.140" style="s2">said it perhaps better than anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.160" end="00:05:48.910" style="s2">has which is not surprising because he</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.140" end="00:05:51.100" style="s2">said many things better than anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.910" end="00:05:52.570" style="s2">has he said all the world&#39;s a stage and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.100" end="00:05:54.250" style="s2">all the men and women merely players</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.570" end="00:05:56.350" style="s2">they have their exits and their</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.550" end="00:06:02.380" style="s2">and so following from that you can</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.030" end="00:06:35.349" style="s2">story written for children of about four</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:37.870" style="s2">years of age but it&#39;s very very elegant</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:51.070" style="s2">remember once my daughter had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.500" end="00:10:52.270" style="s2">nightmare she&#39;s about four this was at</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.070" end="00:10:54.760" style="s2">the time when she first started to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.270" end="00:10:56.380" style="s2">notice graffiti and litter and both</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.760" end="00:10:57.670" style="s2">graffiti and Leonard bothered her she</p>

<p begin="00:10:57.670" end="00:11:01.150" style="s2">behind the graffiti artist and she</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.500" end="00:11:03.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t like the fact that there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.150" end="00:11:05.470" style="s2">litter cluttering up the world&#39;s order</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.460" end="00:11:07.990" style="s2">and the reason she got sensitive to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.470" end="00:11:09.730" style="s2">as a child was because children are</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.990" end="00:11:11.050" style="s2">really really dependent on order right I</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.730" end="00:11:12.850" style="s2">mean and the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.050" end="00:11:15.010" style="s2">their realm of competence is rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.850" end="00:11:17.020" style="s2">restricted so they&#39;d like to see things</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.010" end="00:11:19.690" style="s2">Mac messed up so little kids for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.020" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not happy with you if you play a</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.690" end="00:11:22.089" style="s2">game with them and then mess around with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">the rules of the game they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.089" end="00:11:26.380" style="s2">that at all they think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">immoral activity to shake up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.380" end="00:11:31.540" style="s2">structure of the game well anyways well</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">she was pondering all this she came into</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.540" end="00:11:35.380" style="s2">our bedroom one night and said dad I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:37.300" style="s2">a nightmare now we all know right</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.300" end="00:11:40.899" style="s2">dreams aren&#39;t real of course which</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.370" end="00:11:42.850" style="s2">raises the question of why in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.899" end="00:11:44.860" style="s2">you&#39;d bother having them six or seven</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.850" end="00:11:47.170" style="s2">hours a night every single day of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.860" end="00:11:49.149" style="s2">life and why they&#39;re a recognized</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.230" end="00:12:00.130" style="s2">sorts of garbage and it scared me and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.149" end="00:12:03.130" style="s2">bothered me so much I woke up so I told</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.130" end="00:12:05.800" style="s2">her look close your eyes and imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.130" end="00:12:07.930" style="s2">stream it&#39;s full of garbage what should</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.800" end="00:12:09.339" style="s2">you do about it she said well I should</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.930" end="00:12:11.560" style="s2">take the garbage out of the stream I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.339" end="00:12:13.450" style="s2">said alright so picture the stream</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.560" end="00:12:16.029" style="s2">picture yourself cleaning the garbage</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.450" end="00:12:18.070" style="s2">out of it she calmed down and went back</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.029" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">to sleep why well because dreams</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.070" end="00:12:22.360" style="s2">concentrate on threat we know that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:23.709" style="s2">present threats to you threats you</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.360" end="00:12:25.630" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to deal with well</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.709" end="00:12:28.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of your brain that tracks</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.630" end="00:12:30.310" style="s2">threats and it&#39;s not really all that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.180" end="00:12:33.250" style="s2">smart in some ways all it does is say</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.310" end="00:12:34.600" style="s2">look here&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s waiting</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.250" end="00:12:36.430" style="s2">for the rest of your brain to conjure up</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.600" end="00:12:38.410" style="s2">some solution that problem and if it</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.430" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t conjure up a solution then it</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.410" end="00:12:42.940" style="s2">just presents the problem over and over</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:44.829" style="s2">and over and over and over so people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.940" end="00:12:46.810" style="s2">have post-traumatic stress disorder for</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.829" end="00:12:48.550" style="s2">example who&#39;ve been really upset by</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.810" end="00:12:51.190" style="s2">their contact with something unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.550" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">dream about the same tragedy forever</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.190" end="00:12:58.890" style="s2">until they solve it and they solve it by</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:13:01.329" style="s2">facing it and living it over and over</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.890" end="00:13:02.740" style="s2">voluntarily so you might think right off</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.329" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">the bat from listening to that little</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.740" end="00:13:06.310" style="s2">story that suggesting to your</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:08.350" style="s2">four-year-old daughter who&#39;s just had a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.310" end="00:13:10.029" style="s2">nightmare that her fears aren&#39;t real and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.350" end="00:13:11.890" style="s2">that the dream representation of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.029" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t real because it&#39;s not tangible</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.890" end="00:13:15.880" style="s2">like a table might not really be the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">best approach to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.880" end="00:13:21.630" style="s2">so you see Billy he&#39;s pretty much got it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">right right off the bat right</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.630" end="00:13:26.340" style="s2">the dragon wagged his tail happily when</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.290" style="s2">Billy patted its head Billy went</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.340" end="00:13:30.690" style="s2">downstairs to tell his mother there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.290" end="00:13:34.250" style="s2">such thing as a dragon said Billy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.690" end="00:13:37.140" style="s2">mother and she said it like she meant it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.250" end="00:13:39.090" style="s2">so there&#39;s a dragon in this house now</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.140" end="00:13:40.980" style="s2">the next thing he might wonder is how</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.090" end="00:13:43.500" style="s2">often have you actually gone into a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.980" end="00:13:45.570" style="s2">house where there&#39;s a dragon my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.500" end="00:13:47.670" style="s2">if you don&#39;t take this particularly</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.570" end="00:13:49.050" style="s2">specifically and allow yourself to use</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.670" end="00:13:50.910" style="s2">your imagination and to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.050" end="00:13:53.220" style="s2">metaphorically for a moment you&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.910" end="00:13:55.290" style="s2">encountered dozens of houses that were</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.220" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">filled right to the rafters with various</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.290" end="00:13:58.860" style="s2">dragons all of which were being</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:02.790" style="s2">studiously ignored by the people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.860" end="00:14:04.740" style="s2">inhabited the house Billy went back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.790" end="00:14:06.780" style="s2">his room and began to dress the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.740" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">came close to Billy in a friendly manner</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.780" end="00:14:10.680" style="s2">and wagged its tail but Billy didn&#39;t Pat</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:14.030" style="s2">it if there&#39;s no such thing as something</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.680" end="00:14:14.030" style="s2">it&#39;s silly to Pat it on the head</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.660" end="00:14:19.320" style="s2">Billy washed his face and hands and went</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.280" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">down to breakfast the dragon went along</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.320" end="00:14:28.680" style="s2">it was bigger now almost the size of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:31.830" style="s2">dog Billy sat down at the table</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.680" end="00:14:33.390" style="s2">the dragon sat down on the table this</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.830" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">sort of thing was not usually permitted</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.390" end="00:14:36.630" style="s2">but there wasn&#39;t much Billy&#39;s mother</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:38.910" style="s2">could do about it she&#39;d already said</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.630" end="00:14:41.070" style="s2">there was no such thing as a dragon and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.910" end="00:14:48.150" style="s2">if there&#39;s no such thing you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.070" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">it to get down off the table sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.150" end="00:14:53.100" style="s2">sit with friends of mine who have very</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:55.620" style="s2">young children to eat say and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.100" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">children two or three years old don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.620" end="00:14:59.820" style="s2">sit at the table they sit on the table</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:01.470" style="s2">or they run around the table or they run</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.820" end="00:15:03.420" style="s2">around the table and pull things off the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.470" end="00:15:05.070" style="s2">table or they run around the house and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.420" end="00:15:07.890" style="s2">pull things off all the shelves in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.070" end="00:15:09.480" style="s2">house and keep their parents so busy</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.890" end="00:15:11.190" style="s2">chasing them around that they have no</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.480" end="00:15:13.620" style="s2">time whatsoever to interact as adults</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.190" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">well you have to wonder under those</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.620" end="00:15:18.810" style="s2">circumstances whether you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:21.330" style="s2">with a child or a dragon so to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.810" end="00:15:25.740" style="s2">you also might wonder whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.330" end="00:15:27.390" style="s2">dragon is large and unruly precisely</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.740" end="00:15:28.770" style="s2">because the parents are completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.390" end="00:15:31.550" style="s2">unwilling to admit that it actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.770" end="00:15:31.550" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.690" end="00:15:39.300" style="s2">mother made some pancakes for Billy but</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.530" end="00:15:41.880" style="s2">the dragon ate them all mother made some</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.300" end="00:15:43.530" style="s2">more but the dragon ate those too mother</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.880" end="00:15:46.020" style="s2">kept making pancakes until she ran out</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.530" end="00:15:47.340" style="s2">of batter Billy only got one of them but</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.020" end="00:15:54.630" style="s2">he said that&#39;s all he really wanted</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.340" end="00:15:57.420" style="s2">anyway one time an acquaintance of ours</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.630" end="00:16:00.120" style="s2">in Boston brought their son over to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:02.100" style="s2">babysat at our house and his nanny had</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.120" end="00:16:03.630" style="s2">just been in a car accident so he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.100" end="00:16:06.300" style="s2">being shunted from house to house while</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.630" end="00:16:07.770" style="s2">his parents went off to work and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.300" end="00:16:14.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t have very good reputation this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.770" end="00:16:15.930" style="s2">kid he&#39;s about 4 and he came over to our</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.100" end="00:16:18.260" style="s2">house and with his mother in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.930" end="00:16:20.550" style="s2">and she dropped him off and she said</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.260" end="00:16:21.180" style="s2">well he probably won&#39;t eat all day but</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.550" end="00:16:26.490" style="s2">that&#39;s all right</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.180" end="00:16:30.360" style="s2">and I thought no he&#39;s 4 if he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.490" end="00:16:31.860" style="s2">eat all day ah that&#39;s not alright right</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.360" end="00:16:33.870" style="s2">because kids if they don&#39;t eat they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.860" end="00:16:34.770" style="s2">basically horrible right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.870" end="00:16:36.630" style="s2">sleep but they don&#39;t eat they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.770" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">horrible so it isn&#39;t alright that he</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.630" end="00:16:40.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t eat so then you think well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:41.850" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of dragon associated</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.470" end="00:16:43.890" style="s2">with this child that happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.850" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">interfering perhaps with his ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.890" end="00:16:48.390" style="s2">eat so I came back at noon my wife had</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:51.480" style="s2">taken care of the children that day and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.390" end="00:16:52.860" style="s2">I walked in the house and the other four</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.480" end="00:16:54.360" style="s2">or five kids that we had in the house</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:16:56.700" style="s2">were off playing and this little kid was</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.360" end="00:16:59.850" style="s2">standing in the corner like really</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.700" end="00:17:01.590" style="s2">isolated and looking you know upset</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.850" end="00:17:03.360" style="s2">fundamentally so I went over and I poked</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.590" end="00:17:04.950" style="s2">him a bunch because generally if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.360" end="00:17:06.750" style="s2">poke a kid a little bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.950" end="00:17:08.940" style="s2">well they&#39;ll go like this you know they</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.750" end="00:17:10.560" style="s2">sort of back off but sooner or later you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.940" end="00:17:11.880" style="s2">can crack them and they&#39;ll smile and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.560" end="00:17:13.110" style="s2">then they&#39;ll play not this kid boy</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.880" end="00:17:14.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no bloody way he&#39;s going to play</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.110" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">with me and that was act like he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.940" end="00:17:19.589" style="s2">already learned that adults should</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:21.690" style="s2">either be ignored or that they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.589" end="00:17:24.150" style="s2">trouble and he wasn&#39;t going to let any</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.690" end="00:17:26.280" style="s2">adult into his little world so there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.150" end="00:17:27.780" style="s2">absolutely a dragon associated with that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.280" end="00:17:33.000" style="s2">little boy and it was eating all his</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.780" end="00:17:34.620" style="s2">pancakes Billy went upstairs to brush</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.000" end="00:17:37.080" style="s2">his teeth mothers started clearing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.620" end="00:17:38.190" style="s2">table the dragon who was quite as big as</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.080" end="00:17:39.780" style="s2">mother by this time made himself</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.190" end="00:17:41.930" style="s2">comfortable in the hall rug and went to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.780" end="00:17:41.930" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.049" end="00:17:46.820" style="s2">I really like this one by the time Billy</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.320" end="00:17:49.100" style="s2">came back downstairs the dragon had</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.820" end="00:17:50.659" style="s2">grown so much he filled the hall Billy</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.100" end="00:17:52.450" style="s2">had to go around by way of the living</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.659" end="00:17:55.070" style="s2">room to get to where his mother was I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:57.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t know dragons grew so fast said</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.070" end="00:18:02.539" style="s2">Billy there&#39;s no such thing as a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.110" end="00:18:05.769" style="s2">said mother firmly cleaning the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.539" end="00:18:07.879" style="s2">downstairs took mother all morning</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.769" end="00:18:09.559" style="s2">what with the dragon in the way and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.879" end="00:18:12.769" style="s2">having to climb in and out of windows to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.559" end="00:18:14.330" style="s2">get from room to room so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.769" end="00:18:15.649" style="s2">think back in your own experience when</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.330" end="00:18:17.749" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone to a house where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.649" end="00:18:19.549" style="s2">dragon hiding underneath the living room</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.749" end="00:18:22.129" style="s2">rug and nobody&#39;s saying anything about</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.549" end="00:18:24.619" style="s2">it and then you think how long does it</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.129" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">take to get something absolutely simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.619" end="00:18:29.860" style="s2">done in a house that&#39;s absolutely jammed</p>

<p begin="00:18:34.279" end="00:18:38.210" style="s2">as simple as go out for breakfast in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.259" end="00:18:41.990" style="s2">morning or even perhaps to make a meal</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.210" end="00:18:44.210" style="s2">is virtually impossible why well because</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.990" end="00:18:46.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on in the</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.440" end="00:18:58.220" style="s2">and has grown so large as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.080" end="00:19:01.009" style="s2">that it occupies the whole domain by</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.220" end="00:19:02.629" style="s2">noon the dragon filled the house its</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.009" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">head hung out the front door its tail</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.629" end="00:19:05.899" style="s2">hung out the back door and there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:09.190" style="s2">a room in the house that didn&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.340" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">when the dragon awoke from his nap he</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.600" end="00:19:21.010" style="s2">was hungry the bakery truck went by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">smell of fresh bread was more than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.010" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">Dragon could resist he ran down the</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:38.020" style="s2">went along of course like the shell on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.890" end="00:19:40.059" style="s2">snail the mailman was just coming up the</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.059" end="00:19:44.710" style="s2">their house rushed past him and headed</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.090" end="00:19:46.600" style="s2">down the street he chased the Bixby&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.710" end="00:19:51.610" style="s2">house for a few blocks but he but he</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.600" end="00:19:52.510" style="s2">couldn&#39;t catch it when mr. bixby came</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.610" end="00:19:54.340" style="s2">home for lunch</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.510" end="00:19:57.790" style="s2">the first thing he noticed was that his</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.340" end="00:19:59.140" style="s2">house was gone luckily one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.790" end="00:20:02.380" style="s2">neighbors was able to tell them which</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.140" end="00:20:03.970" style="s2">way it went you know that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.380" end="00:20:06.100" style="s2">happens to people not infrequently -</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.970" end="00:20:08.620" style="s2">right hey they&#39;re not really looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.100" end="00:20:10.690" style="s2">around much at what&#39;s going on and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.620" end="00:20:12.460" style="s2">come home from work one day and their</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.690" end="00:20:15.850" style="s2">house is gone and what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.460" end="00:20:17.740" style="s2">well maybe their children have become</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.850" end="00:20:20.710" style="s2">completely alienated from them or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.740" end="00:20:25.420" style="s2">their wife has decided suddenly but of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.710" end="00:20:26.920" style="s2">course not so suddenly to leave why well</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.420" end="00:20:29.170" style="s2">according to this story it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.920" end="00:20:34.059" style="s2">something ignored was growing in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.170" end="00:20:35.710" style="s2">house mr. bixby got in his car and went</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.059" end="00:20:37.780" style="s2">looking for the house he studied all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.710" end="00:20:38.860" style="s2">houses as he drove along finally he saw</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.780" end="00:20:40.900" style="s2">one that looked familiar</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.860" end="00:20:50.860" style="s2">Millie and mrs. Bixby were waving from</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.900" end="00:20:52.740" style="s2">an upstairs window you know in the 1890s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.860" end="00:20:56.710" style="s2">in India when a house was being built</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.740" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">the local priest equivalent to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.710" end="00:21:00.460" style="s2">priest would come by to set the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.260" style="s2">foundation stone and when he set the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.460" end="00:21:04.990" style="s2">foundation stone he&#39;d take a big spike</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.260" end="00:21:06.340" style="s2">and drove it into the ground and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.990" end="00:21:08.200" style="s2">reason he drove it into the ground at</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.340" end="00:21:10.179" style="s2">the place where the foundation was going</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.200" end="00:21:12.160" style="s2">to be laid was to keep the great dragon</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.179" end="00:21:15.010" style="s2">that is underneath the earth firmly</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.160" end="00:21:17.710" style="s2">pinned down by its head so it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.010" end="00:21:20.230" style="s2">move and shake the house to bits what</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.710" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">does that mean well it means the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.230" end="00:21:23.110" style="s2">thing that&#39;s meant in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:23.980" style="s2">when you&#39;re told not to build your house</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.110" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">on a foundation</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.980" end="00:21:28.900" style="s2">of sound right doesn&#39;t matter how good</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:30.910" style="s2">the house is or how well-constructed it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.900" end="00:21:33.130" style="s2">is or how rich it is if the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.910" end="00:21:35.380" style="s2">is made out of sand or if it rests on</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.130" end="00:21:36.669" style="s2">top of the dragon there&#39;s nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.380" end="00:21:38.740" style="s2">that household that&#39;s ever going to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.669" end="00:21:41.410" style="s2">accomplished that&#39;s positive and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.740" end="00:21:46.630" style="s2">wealth the display that the house might</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.410" end="00:21:48.309" style="s2">consist of is nothing but a sham mr.</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.630" end="00:21:49.960" style="s2">bixby climbed over the dragon&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.309" end="00:21:53.980" style="s2">onto the porch roof and through the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.960" end="00:21:58.210" style="s2">upstairs window how did this happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.980" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">mr. bixby asked it was the dragon said</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.210" end="00:22:03.400" style="s2">Billy there&#39;s no such thing mother</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:06.370" style="s2">started to say there is a dragon Billy</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.400" end="00:22:12.730" style="s2">insisted a very big dragon and Billy</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.370" end="00:22:15.700" style="s2">patted the dragon on the head the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.730" end="00:22:17.710" style="s2">wagged its tail happily then even faster</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.700" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">than it had grown the dragon started</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.710" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">getting smaller</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.710" end="00:22:32.940" style="s2">soon it was kitten sized again how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.230" end="00:22:32.940" style="s2">wine dragons this size said mother</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.670" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">why did it have to grow so big I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.520" end="00:22:51.050" style="s2">sure said Billy but I think it just</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:52.340" style="s2">wanted to be noticed so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.050" end="00:22:54.410" style="s2">you might think about is just what</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.340" end="00:22:56.690" style="s2">happens if you don&#39;t pay a bill like</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.410" end="00:22:58.340" style="s2">really don&#39;t pay it right I mean when it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.690" end="00:23:00.470" style="s2">first comes in it&#39;s only the size of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.340" end="00:23:02.150" style="s2">kitten but if you leave it alone for two</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.470" end="00:23:05.510" style="s2">or three years it pretty much grows into</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.150" end="00:23:07.880" style="s2">a full-fledged dragon why well because</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.510" end="00:23:10.550" style="s2">things that you ignore have a life of</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.880" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">their own complex life like a bill bills</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.550" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">attached to a whole industrial complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">right one of whose major functions is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">make sure that you pay the bill and if</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">you don&#39;t pay the bill then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:22.220" style="s2">immediately find out what it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:24.620" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.220" end="00:23:26.030" style="s2">it&#39;s connected to something immense and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.620" end="00:23:27.920" style="s2">very troublesome and if you allow the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.030" end="00:23:32.030" style="s2">full force of that thing to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.920" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">itself it&#39;s not pretty so one lesson</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.030" end="00:23:39.830" style="s2">from this story is that if something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">nagging at you just a bit it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.830" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">better to deal with it before it turns</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:44.990" style="s2">into a full-fledged dragon and then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:46.670" style="s2">might think well what if it&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.990" end="00:23:48.620" style="s2">full-fledged dragon right I mean then</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.670" end="00:23:50.840" style="s2">what&#39;s your options there&#39;s nothing left</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.620" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">but to run away and so then I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.840" end="00:23:55.100" style="s2">you what we know from fifty years of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">studying the outcome of clinical</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.100" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">psychological interventions so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.550" style="s2">take an extreme case right let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:03.380" style="s2">something truly terrible has happened to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.550" end="00:24:04.370" style="s2">you and as a consequence of that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.380" end="00:24:06.620" style="s2">in shock</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.370" end="00:24:09.320" style="s2">post traumatic shock which is a</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.320" end="00:24:13.580" style="s2">damage your brain over time it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.900" end="00:24:15.559" style="s2">only a psychological disorder it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.580" end="00:24:17.570" style="s2">physical disorder if you really stress</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.559" end="00:24:19.400" style="s2">your cortisol levels shoot up and if</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.400" end="00:24:23.809" style="s2">cortisol and high doses is a neurotoxin</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.809" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2">take a very extreme case and imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.970" end="00:24:30.230" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been violently sexually</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.980" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">assaulted and as a consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.230" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">you&#39;re in post-traumatic shock how do</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.809" style="s2">you get cured so that means you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:36.980" style="s2">really go outside you certainly can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:24:48.999" end="00:24:52.029" style="s2">world&#39;s top clinical psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.739" end="00:24:53.499" style="s2">she&#39;s been dealing with women who have</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.250" end="00:33:13.759" style="s2">you move from motivated world to</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.759" end="00:33:18.200" style="s2">you inhabit you chop the world up in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.409" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">different pieces so a piano for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.200" end="00:33:22.250" style="s2">concert pianist is different as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:23.809" style="s2">different phenomena than a piano for</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.250" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">someone who has no musical education</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.809" end="00:33:27.950" style="s2">but you&#39;re always parsing up the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:29.720" style="s2">in terms of what it&#39;s good for how it</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.950" end="00:33:33.950" style="s2">can serve your purposes and you even see</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.720" end="00:33:36.259" style="s2">it that way now the question is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.950" end="00:33:37.789" style="s2">complicated question isn&#39;t so much how</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.259" end="00:33:40.669" style="s2">do you parse up the world into things</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.789" end="00:33:42.970" style="s2">that are useful to you like chairs the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.669" end="00:33:45.950" style="s2">complicated question is what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.970" end="00:33:49.879" style="s2">when something that you don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.950" end="00:33:54.950" style="s2">happens so imagine you&#39;ve had a 15 year</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.879" end="00:33:58.250" style="s2">long marriage and you find lipstick on</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.950" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">your husband&#39;s collar not once but three</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.250" end="00:34:05.509" style="s2">times and then you think well I thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:07.580" style="s2">I had a map right I thought we were both</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.509" end="00:34:10.280" style="s2">in the same game I thought we were both</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.580" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">going from point A to the same point B I</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.280" end="00:34:14.750" style="s2">thought we had established a shared</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:17.780" style="s2">structure of interpretation but I find</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.750" end="00:34:20.060" style="s2">that there&#39;s some aspect of his apparent</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.780" end="00:34:21.740" style="s2">behavior it&#39;s completely outside my</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.060" end="00:34:23.389" style="s2">scope of interpretation what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.740" end="00:34:25.069" style="s2">well you can choose to ignore that right</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.389" end="00:34:27.079" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to do that why would you not</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.069" end="00:34:29.569" style="s2">why would you ignore it because if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.079" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">don&#39;t ignore it you have to think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.569" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">not who I thought he was and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:34.760" style="s2">really not a good thing to think because</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:37.010" style="s2">people are really really really</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.760" end="00:34:38.899" style="s2">complicated and if they&#39;re not who you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.010" end="00:34:41.089" style="s2">think they are you have no idea who they</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.899" end="00:34:43.490" style="s2">might be and you also might think well</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.089" end="00:34:45.409" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m not who I think I am because</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.490" end="00:34:47.690" style="s2">after all I got sucked into this</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.409" end="00:34:49.700" style="s2">situation I thought I&#39;d pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.690" end="00:34:52.250" style="s2">understood the world and turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.700" end="00:34:54.020" style="s2">I certainly don&#39;t understand the office&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.250" end="00:34:55.250" style="s2">gender and there&#39;s some indication that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.020" end="00:34:57.619" style="s2">I really don&#39;t even understand myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.250" end="00:34:59.599" style="s2">because fundamentally I&#39;m so clueless</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.619" end="00:35:01.880" style="s2">and then you might think well when did</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.599" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">this start this cluelessness how long</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.880" end="00:35:04.310" style="s2">have I been blind well do you really</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:06.350" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.310" end="00:35:08.000" style="s2">that question well not generally right</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.350" end="00:35:10.930" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to keep the dragon in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.000" end="00:35:13.340" style="s2">closet which is where it tends to live</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.930" end="00:35:24.920" style="s2">what happens when you encounter</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.340" end="00:35:26.570" style="s2">something you don&#39;t expect for a long</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.920" end="00:35:29.170" style="s2">time psychologists thought that people</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.570" end="00:35:32.270" style="s2">learned fear right so your typical</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.170" end="00:35:35.030" style="s2">person your typical lab rat was a calm</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.270" end="00:35:36.860" style="s2">and creature now it&#39;s a funny thing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.030" end="00:35:39.470" style="s2">because if you take a lab rat out of his</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.860" end="00:35:40.880" style="s2">home cage and he put him in a new cage</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.470" end="00:35:42.350" style="s2">where you want to teach him say to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:43.880" style="s2">afraid of something to be afraid of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.350" end="00:35:46.130" style="s2">light paired with a shock which is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.880" end="00:35:47.720" style="s2">typical psychological experiment the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.130" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">funny thing about the rat is you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.720" end="00:35:52.610" style="s2">to let him calm down before he&#39;s normal</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:54.890" style="s2">well except that you might think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.610" end="00:35:56.150" style="s2">the not comrade is also the normal route</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.890" end="00:35:57.770" style="s2">right you take the route out of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.150" end="00:36:00.170" style="s2">cage and you put him in the new cage and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.770" end="00:36:02.660" style="s2">what does he do he goes like this why</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.170" end="00:36:05.000" style="s2">well he&#39;s a rat right someone might eat</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.660" end="00:36:07.100" style="s2">him so he&#39;s a bit nervous about being in</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.000" end="00:36:08.930" style="s2">this new situation rats do not like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.100" end="00:36:10.730" style="s2">being in new situations they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.930" end="00:36:12.080" style="s2">bright light if you put them in a new</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.730" end="00:36:13.550" style="s2">situation that&#39;s brightly lit they go</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.080" end="00:36:16.010" style="s2">right over to the corner because they</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.550" end="00:36:17.630" style="s2">think maybe cats won&#39;t find them rats</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.010" end="00:36:19.610" style="s2">are so afraid of cats that they never</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.630" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">even have to meet a cat to be afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.610" end="00:36:23.720" style="s2">them so you can take a rat that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">seen a cat in his life and if you let</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.720" end="00:36:29.210" style="s2">him smell some cat odor or show him a</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:32.060" style="s2">cat he&#39;ll well I&#39;ll tell you if you show</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.210" end="00:36:34.550" style="s2">a rat a cat somewhere he doesn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.060" end="00:36:39.800" style="s2">it he will run back to his burrow and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.550" end="00:36:41.750" style="s2">scream for 24 hours now you imagine how</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.800" end="00:36:43.430" style="s2">scared you&#39;d have to be to scream for 24</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.750" end="00:36:45.860" style="s2">hours especially given rattle he lives</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.430" end="00:36:48.380" style="s2">about a year so that would be for you</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.860" end="00:36:53.030" style="s2">like screaming I&#39;ll be like screaming</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.380" end="00:36:55.640" style="s2">for 3 months right so the rat runs back</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.030" end="00:36:57.860" style="s2">to his burrow and he screams at every</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.640" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">other rat who hears him scream freezes</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.860" end="00:37:03.410" style="s2">and they all stay like that for 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">until they sort of calm down and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.410" end="00:37:06.200" style="s2">the first thing they do is they go back</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">to the place where they saw the cat and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.200" end="00:37:09.500" style="s2">they start to map it out so they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:11.660" style="s2">these things called corner runs which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.500" end="00:37:13.310" style="s2">so the rat wants to go back to this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.660" end="00:37:15.260" style="s2">territory knows the territory might be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.310" end="00:37:17.480" style="s2">place where he gets food is the cat</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.260" end="00:37:17.640" style="s2">still there well you might think stay in</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.480" end="00:37:19.019" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.640" end="00:37:21.089" style="s2">Burrell right but then maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.019" end="00:37:22.849" style="s2">get something to eat so the rad goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.089" end="00:37:26.279" style="s2">back to the place where the cat was</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.849" end="00:37:28.650" style="s2">carefully and then he hunches down and</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.580" end="00:40:37.350" style="s2">and they find out nothing terrible is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.830" end="00:40:38.550" style="s2">happening sooner or later and then they</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.350" end="00:40:39.630" style="s2">go another three feet and then they go</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.550" end="00:40:41.760" style="s2">another three feet and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.630" end="00:40:44.340" style="s2">they&#39;re like confronting the elevator</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:45.540" style="s2">and then they&#39;re inside the elevator but</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.340" end="00:40:47.310" style="s2">they&#39;re going like this so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.540" end="00:40:48.300" style="s2">want to look at the elevator right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.310" end="00:40:49.860" style="s2">you say well you got a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.300" end="00:40:53.430" style="s2">elevator you look at the numbers you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.860" end="00:40:55.380" style="s2">look at the buttons so they do that then</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.430" end="00:40:57.360" style="s2">you think well could we go up a floor no</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t go up a floor okay well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.360" end="00:41:00.660" style="s2">tell you what we&#39;ll just close the door</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.130" style="s2">I&#39;ll put my hand and it&#39;ll open again</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.660" end="00:41:06.150" style="s2">could you do that yeah I could do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.130" end="00:41:07.560" style="s2">step by step sooner or later and usually</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.150" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">sooner bang they&#39;ve gone up a floor</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.560" end="00:41:12.510" style="s2">right so then what happens they go home</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:13.940" style="s2">and have a fight with your husband</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.510" end="00:41:17.160" style="s2">that&#39;s been brewing for like 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.940" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">why well it&#39;s not because the elevators</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.160" end="00:41:21.930" style="s2">symbolically related to the fight has</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:25.170" style="s2">nothing to do with it it&#39;s because what</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.930" end="00:41:27.660" style="s2">the person learns in the combat with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.170" end="00:41:29.370" style="s2">unknown which just happens to be taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.660" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">the guise of an elevator is that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.370" end="00:41:32.850" style="s2">can confront things that frighten them</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:34.740" style="s2">without being destroyed by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.850" end="00:41:36.930" style="s2">confrontation and so what you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.740" end="00:41:38.670" style="s2">immediately and this was contrary to an</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.930" end="00:41:40.680" style="s2">original psychoanalytic prediction is</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.670" end="00:41:41.790" style="s2">that man you know you take that person</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.680" end="00:41:43.710" style="s2">out you teach them they can go on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.790" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">elevator and right off the bat they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.710" end="00:41:46.710" style="s2">going to shopping malls there</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.360" style="s2">in taxis there back in the subway and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.710" end="00:41:51.210" style="s2">they&#39;re standing up for themselves at</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.360" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">home generalization why because they</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.210" end="00:41:55.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t learn that the elevator wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:57.480" style="s2">frightening that isn&#39;t what they learned</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.110" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">they learned that despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.480" end="00:42:00.810" style="s2">the elevator was as terrifying as</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:02.670" style="s2">anything they&#39;ve ever encountered they</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.810" end="00:42:04.590" style="s2">were actually up to the challenge and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.670" end="00:42:06.840" style="s2">now that&#39;s a really useful thing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.590" end="00:42:09.030" style="s2">teach someone right because if you have</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.600" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">sick I might lose the people that I love</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.700" end="00:43:16.680" style="s2">not only might that happen it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:20.150" style="s2">happen why aren&#39;t people afraid of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.680" end="00:43:22.380" style="s2">all the time we don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.150" end="00:43:24.210" style="s2">obsessive person becomes aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.380" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">what do you tell them you say do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.210" end="00:43:28.980" style="s2">anyway do it anyways and they learn</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:30.990" style="s2">quickly that if they don&#39;t run away from</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.980" end="00:43:32.730" style="s2">the thing they&#39;re afraid of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.990" end="00:43:36.210" style="s2">something in them that responds to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.730" end="00:43:39.210" style="s2">they learn that the fear is not larger</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.210" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">than they are now I like Aetna foa&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.210" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">case in particular because you always</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:44.370" style="s2">might wonder with this like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:45.690" style="s2">limit right okay yeah that sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.370" end="00:43:47.580" style="s2">theory but what if something really</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.690" end="00:43:49.080" style="s2">terrible is happening to you well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.580" end="00:43:51.000" style="s2">happened dead new foa&#39;s patients that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.080" end="00:43:53.070" style="s2">up there and with terrible right to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.000" end="00:43:55.980" style="s2">nuts up there with terrible right</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.070" end="00:43:58.740" style="s2">stripped of social dignity violated</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.980" end="00:44:01.740" style="s2">physically that combines two of people</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.740" end="00:44:04.500" style="s2">most specific fears well then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.740" end="00:44:06.210" style="s2">other kinds of confrontation to it I</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.500" end="00:44:07.410" style="s2">like the story of Solzhenitsyn I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.210" end="00:44:08.820" style="s2">it&#39;s really a good one because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.410" end="00:44:11.670" style="s2">different kinds of dragons right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.820" end="00:44:13.530" style="s2">natural dragons like death and disease</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.670" end="00:44:17.460" style="s2">and then there&#39;s social dragons like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.530" end="00:44:19.260" style="s2">bureaucracies and tyrannies Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.460" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn you may or may not know was</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.260" end="00:44:24.630" style="s2">a prisoner in the Soviet gulag</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:26.520" style="s2">concentration camp system that by his</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.630" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">report at least killed 60 million people</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.520" end="00:44:31.410" style="s2">between 1919 and 1959 right 60 million</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:33.180" style="s2">that&#39;s ten times as many as Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.410" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">killed at least with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.180" end="00:44:37.740" style="s2">genocide 60 million people</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.210" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn he had a pretty nasty life</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.740" end="00:44:41.250" style="s2">I mean first of all he&#39;s on the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.210" end="00:44:43.710" style="s2">front which was a nasty place to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.250" end="00:44:46.619" style="s2">Mamie was captured by the German so they</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.710" end="00:44:48.330" style="s2">didn&#39;t like Russians so they put them in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.619" end="00:44:49.920" style="s2">separate prisoners of war camp partly</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.330" end="00:44:51.690" style="s2">because Stalin who is a consummate</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.920" end="00:44:53.430" style="s2">paranoid wouldn&#39;t sign the Geneva</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.690" end="00:44:56.970" style="s2">Convention on the treatment of prisoners</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.430" end="00:44:59.220" style="s2">of war so the Germans set up extra Theo</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.970" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">W camps for the Russians and they starve</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.220" end="00:45:03.090" style="s2">generally so badly that if other PLW</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:05.700" style="s2">were in the vicinity they&#39;d throw food</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.090" end="00:45:08.060" style="s2">packages over the wire even though they</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.700" end="00:45:10.859" style="s2">themselves weren&#39;t particularly well fed</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.060" end="00:45:12.270" style="s2">so then so the war ends the Russians win</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.859" end="00:45:13.830" style="s2">it so Shinkansen goes back to Russia</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.270" end="00:45:16.619" style="s2">right and what happens he&#39;s thinking you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.830" end="00:45:18.930" style="s2">know wow this is over we help defend the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.619" end="00:45:20.609" style="s2">fatherland we&#39;re going to get if not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.930" end="00:45:23.640" style="s2">hero&#39;s welcome at least some welcome but</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.609" end="00:45:25.080" style="s2">Stellan figured no no these Russians had</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.640" end="00:45:27.240" style="s2">been to the West they were contaminated</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.080" end="00:45:29.550" style="s2">by their exposure to the Western</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.240" end="00:45:30.600" style="s2">economic system and as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.550" end="00:45:32.220" style="s2">that they posed a threat to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.600" end="00:45:34.859" style="s2">integrity of the Soviet state so he just</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.220" end="00:45:37.380" style="s2">threw them all in concentration camps so</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.859" end="00:45:40.050" style="s2">fine so Solzhenitsyn sitting there in</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.380" end="00:45:42.300" style="s2">this concentration camp on a coal pile a</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.050" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">coal pile which contained this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.300" end="00:45:45.750" style="s2">clay that his compatriots would eat</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:47.070" style="s2">because they were so damn hungry that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.750" end="00:45:48.450" style="s2">was better to have the clay in their</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.070" end="00:45:52.380" style="s2">stomach than nothing at all and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.450" end="00:45:53.250" style="s2">thought all right what the hell did I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.380" end="00:45:55.560" style="s2">to get here</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.250" end="00:45:57.060" style="s2">which is really a remarkable thing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.560" end="00:45:59.430" style="s2">think right because like there was the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.060" end="00:46:01.380" style="s2">Second World War and that probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.430" end="00:46:03.330" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be pinned directly on him and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.380" end="00:46:05.310" style="s2">then there is Stalin who was you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.330" end="00:46:07.500" style="s2">really one of the world&#39;s worst monsters</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.310" end="00:46:10.350" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the concentration camp</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.500" end="00:46:12.190" style="s2">and the POWs camp and like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.350" end="00:46:14.410" style="s2">things happen to Solzhenitsyn but</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.190" end="00:46:16.030" style="s2">he said he had nothing but time to think</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.410" end="00:46:17.320" style="s2">in this concentration camp and he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.030" end="00:46:20.440" style="s2">really that happy with the way things</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.320" end="00:46:22.570" style="s2">turned out so he made a vow in the camp</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.440" end="00:46:24.550" style="s2">and the vow was this he said he is going</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.570" end="00:46:26.650" style="s2">to go back over his whole life whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.550" end="00:46:29.260" style="s2">life right from day one and try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.650" end="00:46:32.020" style="s2">remember every time he ever did</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.260" end="00:46:33.430" style="s2">something he thought was wrong he</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.020" end="00:46:37.600" style="s2">thought right not someone else but that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.430" end="00:46:38.950" style="s2">that gave his conscience a pang and he</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.600" end="00:46:40.330" style="s2">said well since I don&#39;t have anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.950" end="00:46:42.580" style="s2">better to do I mean spend like the next</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.330" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">10 years seeing if I can undo all those</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.580" end="00:46:46.930" style="s2">little knots in my soul that I tied and</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">the consequence of that was that he</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.930" end="00:46:48.580" style="s2">wrote a book called the Gulag</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:50.950" style="s2">Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.580" end="00:46:53.290" style="s2">write three volume book 19 hundred pages</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.950" end="00:46:54.970" style="s2">long he memorized it because there</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.290" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">wasn&#39;t any paper-and-pencil available</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.970" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">for him in prison and then it circulated</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:01.510" style="s2">in the underground in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:05.560" style="s2">for years before it got published in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.510" end="00:47:07.270" style="s2">West published in 1975 definitely one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.560" end="00:47:09.130" style="s2">the literary events that brought down</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.270" end="00:47:11.110" style="s2">the Soviet Union I think that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.130" end="00:47:13.120" style="s2">interesting isn&#39;t it think this one guy</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.110" end="00:47:15.340" style="s2">right it&#39;s got numbers tattooed on his</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.120" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">arm he&#39;s as skinny as a rail he&#39;s 3/4</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.340" end="00:47:20.260" style="s2">dead he&#39;s been beat to death in 15</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:22.300" style="s2">different ways he decides under</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.260" end="00:47:23.350" style="s2">completely unreasonable circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.300" end="00:47:24.970" style="s2">that he&#39;s going to take personal</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.350" end="00:47:26.350" style="s2">responsibility for the position that he</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.970" end="00:47:28.870" style="s2">happens to find himself in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.350" end="00:47:30.250" style="s2">consequence of that 25 years later is</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.870" end="00:47:32.560" style="s2">that Solzhenitsyn still around</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.250" end="00:47:34.390" style="s2">Soviet Union isn&#39;t and you think well</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.560" end="00:47:36.340" style="s2">that can&#39;t be the way the world works</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.390" end="00:47:37.960" style="s2">now can it but then you think this to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.340" end="00:47:39.790" style="s2">like do we really know how the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.960" end="00:47:41.560" style="s2">works right we&#39;ve had a pretty nasty</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.790" end="00:47:43.900" style="s2">century in the last hundred years right</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.560" end="00:47:46.540" style="s2">we had the Nazis we had mild side tongue</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.900" end="00:47:47.710" style="s2">we had the recent tragedies in Africa we</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.540" end="00:47:50.170" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to learn anything about</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.710" end="00:47:54.700" style="s2">genocide someone like Solzhenitsyn says</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.170" end="00:47:58.630" style="s2">well you know might be your fault Why</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.700" end="00:48:00.700" style="s2">What are you ignoring good question can</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.630" end="00:48:02.770" style="s2">you make peace with your own family it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.700" end="00:48:04.210" style="s2">not so easy right it&#39;s probably no</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.770" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">easier than making peace between the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.210" end="00:48:12.130" style="s2">Israelis and the Palestinians what do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:13.890" style="s2">encounter when we encounter something we</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.130" end="00:48:17.770" style="s2">don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.890" end="00:48:20.170" style="s2">we all know it&#39;s not the simple world of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.770" end="00:48:22.090" style="s2">objects the simpler world of objects is</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.170" end="00:48:24.900" style="s2">something we&#39;ve learned to see the real</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.090" end="00:48:26.820" style="s2">world is way more complicated than</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.900" end="00:48:32.780" style="s2">what we just see let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.820" end="00:48:36.840" style="s2">example when I was in Montreal in 1985</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.780" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">my computer crashed so what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.840" end="00:48:39.660" style="s2">when your computer crashes well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:41.550" style="s2">not when the computer encounters</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.660" end="00:48:42.990" style="s2">something unexpected it crashes it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.550" end="00:48:45.750" style="s2">do a damn thing about it you have to fix</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.990" end="00:48:49.410" style="s2">it so I checked the monitor it was okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.750" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t go on seemed alright and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.410" end="00:48:52.950" style="s2">noticed my lamps weren&#39;t working so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">went the fuse box so all the fuses</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.950" end="00:48:56.820" style="s2">seemed okay so then I went outside to go</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.180" end="00:52:30.309" style="s2">upset in his house so I was there one</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.630" end="00:52:31.839" style="s2">night when he woke up screaming next</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.309" end="00:52:33.219" style="s2">morning I said well did you dream</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.839" end="00:52:39.069" style="s2">anything and so he launched into this</p>

<p begin="00:53:01.900" end="00:53:04.839" style="s2">I mean you know that doesn&#39;t sound so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.369" end="00:53:07.420" style="s2">good and then he said well wait there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.839" end="00:53:09.969" style="s2">more right back in the distance there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.420" end="00:53:13.210" style="s2">a dragon and the dragon is puffing out</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.969" end="00:53:14.890" style="s2">fire and smoke and every time he pops</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.210" end="00:53:17.829" style="s2">out fire and smoke it turns into these</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.890" end="00:53:19.299" style="s2">dwarfs big problem right just like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.829" end="00:53:23.589" style="s2">problem of the Hydra in Greek mythology</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.180" end="00:53:34.809" style="s2">I said what can you do about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.469" end="00:53:36.609" style="s2">now in a legal trial that would have</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.809" end="00:53:38.530" style="s2">been an inadmissible question right</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.609" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">that&#39;s called leading the whip</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.530" end="00:53:44.710" style="s2">because what I told him was despite the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:47.050" style="s2">horror of this situation you maybe could</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.710" end="00:53:49.660" style="s2">do something about it honey said ha I</p>

<p begin="00:54:03.460" end="00:54:08.320" style="s2">this sword I&#39;d go down his throat to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.430" end="00:54:10.270" style="s2">place where the fire comes out I cut a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.320" end="00:54:10.900" style="s2">piece of that box out and I&#39;d use it as</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.270" end="00:54:13.650" style="s2">a shield</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.900" end="00:54:15.310" style="s2">and I thought wow that&#39;s unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.650" end="00:54:16.630" style="s2">unbelievable that he could do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.310" end="00:54:18.970" style="s2">perfect right there&#39;s no sense going</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.630" end="00:54:20.829" style="s2">after the dwarfs because thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.970" end="00:54:23.770" style="s2">them you might as well go after the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.829" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">dragon what happens if you go after the</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.770" end="00:54:28.810" style="s2">dragon you get a piece of it right a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:30.990" style="s2">piece of its center nature a piece that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.810" end="00:54:34.030" style="s2">can defend you against anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.990" end="00:54:37.480" style="s2">including other dragons so what if this</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.030" end="00:54:40.180" style="s2">was the case thankful evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.480" end="00:54:42.849" style="s2">speaking or religiously speaking what if</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.180" end="00:54:44.800" style="s2">we were adapted to the world now what if</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.849" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not the simple place of dead</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.800" end="00:54:48.910" style="s2">objects that we think it is what if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:52.089" style="s2">something a lot more alive a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.910" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">like a story what if the story is</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.089" end="00:54:59.260" style="s2">something like this you have absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:55:02.560" style="s2">everything you need but you have to use</p>

<p begin="00:55:02.560" end="00:55:06.069" style="s2">and in particular the parts of it that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.329" end="00:55:07.990" style="s2">frighten you which you know there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.069" end="00:55:10.210" style="s2">endless reasons to run away from if you</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.210" end="00:55:15.250" style="s2">that piece of the dragon if you miss</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.700" end="00:55:16.839" style="s2">even one piece there&#39;s a [ __ ] in your</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.220" end="00:55:25.390" style="s2">yourself you&#39;re going to run away more</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:27.490" style="s2">not only that when someone wants to lean</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.390" end="00:55:28.750" style="s2">on you they&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.490" end="00:55:31.390" style="s2">lean on you because you&#39;ll just fall</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.750" end="00:55:33.970" style="s2">over what if it was the case that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.390" end="00:55:36.819" style="s2">were adapted to the world really adapted</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.970" end="00:55:40.089" style="s2">to it so that if we made full use of all</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.819" end="00:55:43.020" style="s2">the talents we had we&#39;d be okay what if</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.089" end="00:55:46.030" style="s2">it was the case that if we set out</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.020" end="00:55:47.859" style="s2">consciously to never run away from</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.030" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">something we know we shouldn&#39;t run away</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.859" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">from that everything would be all right</p>
