<p begin="00:00:26.529" end="00:00:33.550" style="s2">depression well so a primary question is</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.990" end="00:00:35.260" style="s2">why are we even looking at psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.550" end="00:00:38.410" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking at succulents for two</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.260" end="00:00:40.090" style="s2">reasons one is that as I mentioned</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.929" end="00:01:29.170" style="s2">illness but fundamentally we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.240" end="00:01:31.720" style="s2">denial about the unity of the human soul</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.970" end="00:01:44.050" style="s2">solutions outside the mainstream as they</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.459" end="00:01:46.690" style="s2">as they have to because within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.050" end="00:01:50.229" style="s2">mainstream their responses and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.690" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">Prevention&#39;s are so nautical no</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.229" end="00:01:58.119" style="s2">psychedelics tell us I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">specifically but not exclusively get to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.119" end="00:02:05.800" style="s2">a part of ourselves but usually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">not in Access of so they get to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.800" end="00:02:13.489" style="s2">unconscious part while we&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:17.390" style="s2">so we get the experience or unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.489" end="00:02:23.709" style="s2">while conscious and we can see what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.390" end="00:02:26.659" style="s2">there now why on the physiological level</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.709" end="00:02:29.299" style="s2">the second let&#39;s do that I have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.659" end="00:02:31.849" style="s2">looking it up I just I&#39;m not keeping in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.299" end="00:02:33.830" style="s2">my head that particular neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.849" end="00:02:35.239" style="s2">brain physiology that&#39;s involved but</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.830" end="00:02:38.450" style="s2">clearly parts of the brain are being</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.239" end="00:02:41.870" style="s2">activated that I usually are shut down</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">or we have no access to and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.870" end="00:02:47.959" style="s2">psilocybin has been used in two ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.060" end="00:02:52.459" style="s2">it&#39;s been used as single fairly large</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.959" end="00:02:55.099" style="s2">dose experiences and through those</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.459" end="00:02:56.989" style="s2">experiences people get in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.099" end="00:02:58.849" style="s2">parts of themselves they usually have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.989" end="00:03:01.430" style="s2">access to for example they might have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.849" end="00:03:04.129" style="s2">deep spiritual experience a deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.430" end="00:03:07.370" style="s2">experience of unity a deep experience of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.129" end="00:03:09.609" style="s2">the true self part of their real sub</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.370" end="00:03:12.859" style="s2">that usually are shut down from their</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.609" end="00:03:15.410" style="s2">daily experience well that could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.859" end="00:03:17.569" style="s2">tremendously healing but what if I no</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.410" end="00:03:20.989" style="s2">longer saw myself as an isolated little</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.569" end="00:03:26.870" style="s2">ant crawling around for survival in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.989" end="00:03:30.769" style="s2">huge ant heap but as a meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.870" end="00:03:33.319" style="s2">genuine part of a larger whole and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.769" end="00:03:34.790" style="s2">unity is unshakable no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.319" end="00:03:37.430" style="s2">happens to me and no matter what I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.790" end="00:03:40.130" style="s2">at a particular moment but if I could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.430" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">conscious of that unity if it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.130" end="00:03:44.750" style="s2">a totally different experience of life</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:46.819" style="s2">so along with other psychedelics like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.750" end="00:03:50.750" style="s2">cell step you can do that and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.819" end="00:03:52.370" style="s2">striking is that it doesn&#39;t matter what</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.750" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">the psychedelic experience when people</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.370" end="00:03:56.419" style="s2">describe their experience of unity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:57.889" style="s2">all the same language and it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.419" end="00:04:00.739" style="s2">same language if people get there</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.889" end="00:04:02.090" style="s2">without psychedelics so either</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.739" end="00:04:04.069" style="s2">everybody&#39;s hallucinating and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.090" end="00:04:06.049" style="s2">everybody&#39;s crazy or they&#39;re having some</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.069" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">genuine experience of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.049" end="00:04:10.609" style="s2">deeper than our usual consciousness can</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:14.989" style="s2">permit and that&#39;s what happens I believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.609" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s either silent then people also use</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.989" end="00:04:20.390" style="s2">it and this is still experimental on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">micro level where people are not using</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.390" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">it to have this deep experience in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.010" end="00:04:25.030" style="s2">I might have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2">an amount that doesn&#39;t even give them an</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.030" end="00:04:30.970" style="s2">altered consciousness in a short-term</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">but over a couple of weeks micro dosing</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.970" end="00:04:35.409" style="s2">with am I used four to three days and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:37.690" style="s2">then not used for a few days but in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.409" end="00:04:39.610" style="s2">small barely perceptible those yet</p>

<p begin="00:04:39.610" end="00:04:43.180" style="s2">way that they&#39;re no longer addicted any</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">image case they&#39;re using it like an</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.180" end="00:04:47.379" style="s2">antidepressant the difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:49.090" style="s2">I&#39;m to use that every day they use small</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.379" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">quantities and they don&#39;t have side</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.090" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">effects which and I&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:54.759" style="s2">antidepressants I&#39;m not against them but</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:59.139" style="s2">you know they do come with side effects</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.759" end="00:05:04.629" style="s2">sometimes and what are the risks of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.139" end="00:05:08.710" style="s2">kind of therapy well the risk is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.629" end="00:05:11.430" style="s2">only that if people have experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.710" end="00:05:15.580" style="s2">they can handle and leave them on board</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.430" end="00:05:17.590" style="s2">so these expenses these plants</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.710" end="00:06:04.750" style="s2">few people lose it as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.009" end="00:06:07.419" style="s2">psychedelic experiences I&#39;ve not seen</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.509" end="00:06:17.529" style="s2">seen some difficult outcomes so the risk</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.550" end="00:06:21.159" style="s2">is using it when you&#39;re not prepared and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.529" end="00:06:22.990" style="s2">not under appropriate guidance now some</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.910" end="00:06:38.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t think because it can trigger</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.060" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">but there are certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:52.190" style="s2">indications because obviously there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:54.260" style="s2">a huge enthusiasm for these substances</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.190" end="00:06:57.560" style="s2">in the 50s and 60s there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.260" end="00:07:00.620" style="s2">really amazing and very promising work</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.560" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">going on and then the entire field was</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.620" end="00:07:04.700" style="s2">shut down what do you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:05.930" style="s2">lessons that can be learned from that to</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.700" end="00:07:09.080" style="s2">avoid something like that happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.930" end="00:07:10.820" style="s2">again so in the fifties and sixties two</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.080" end="00:07:11.630" style="s2">kinds of work occurred with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.820" end="00:07:14.480" style="s2">psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.630" end="00:07:19.100" style="s2">the first work which preceded the second</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.480" end="00:07:21.350" style="s2">was very responsible scientific research</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.100" end="00:07:24.500" style="s2">work and some very important work was</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.350" end="00:07:26.570" style="s2">done develop see for example in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.500" end="00:07:29.870" style="s2">and in North America and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.570" end="00:07:32.510" style="s2">elsewhere where they found some very</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.870" end="00:07:36.290" style="s2">positive results and its impact on</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.510" end="00:07:39.500" style="s2">mental illness that was scientific work</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.290" end="00:07:41.690" style="s2">very rigorous Emira its flaws but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.500" end="00:07:45.530" style="s2">intentions were purely to advance</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.690" end="00:07:47.330" style="s2">science and human health that then got</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.530" end="00:07:50.530" style="s2">coupled in the 60s for the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.330" end="00:07:53.150" style="s2">explosion of psychedelics with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.530" end="00:07:55.730" style="s2">anti-vietnam war movement the whole</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.730" end="00:08:01.040" style="s2">became very apparent in the 60s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.370" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">whole mistrust of tradition and elder</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.040" end="00:08:09.190" style="s2">guidance not to mention the mass of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:12.650" style="s2">experience need to escape from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.190" end="00:08:14.090" style="s2">rigidity of the mainstream culture a lot</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:24.200" style="s2">any kind of scientific inspiration so a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.370" end="00:08:26.570" style="s2">lot of people used it and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.200" end="00:08:29.180" style="s2">lot of negative experiences there were</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.570" end="00:08:30.950" style="s2">people who saw it off the top of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.180" end="00:08:33.070" style="s2">buildings only the impact of LSD</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.950" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">thinking they could fly and of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.070" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">finding out that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:42.490" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t really fly some people</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:44.020" style="s2">went insane using these psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.490" end="00:08:45.970" style="s2">again because they weren&#39;t using in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.020" end="00:08:49.890" style="s2">context for the right indications with</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.970" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">the right guidance the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.890" end="00:08:55.390" style="s2">ideologues and politicians scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:57.490" style="s2">figures who were suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.390" end="00:08:59.590" style="s2">psychedelics in the first place and who</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.490" end="00:09:01.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t like this happening that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.590" end="00:09:06.190" style="s2">occur under their control in the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.090" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">place then either in they were inspired</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.190" end="00:09:12.760" style="s2">by these missteps or used them as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:15.130" style="s2">excuse to clamp down on the whole field</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.760" end="00:09:19.030" style="s2">of psychedelic research so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.130" end="00:09:21.250" style="s2">retrenchment and a giving up of some</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.030" end="00:09:24.090" style="s2">very useful avenues of inquiry that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.250" end="00:09:27.270" style="s2">persisted for decades until again the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.090" end="00:09:29.710" style="s2">cultural crisis and the general</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.270" end="00:09:32.770" style="s2">inadequacy of mainstream medical</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.710" end="00:09:35.410" style="s2">perspectives led to a resurgence which</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.770" end="00:09:39.280" style="s2">is what we&#39;re seeing now and for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.410" end="00:09:40.690" style="s2">most part what we&#39;re seeing now is much</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.280" end="00:09:45.160" style="s2">more scientific and much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.690" end="00:09:47.500" style="s2">responsible use of these substances with</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.160" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">some of the dangers that also attended</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.500" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">it in the sixties ago and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">other the fact that they&#39;re becoming</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:56.680" style="s2">much more mainstream or one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:58.060" style="s2">areas of concern I know for some in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.680" end="00:10:00.340" style="s2">psychedelic community is that we now</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.060" end="00:10:03.340" style="s2">have corporate interest we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.340" end="00:10:08.010" style="s2">companies coming in that are monetizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.340" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">this are you concerned about that well</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.010" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">just a reality the fact any economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:17.500" style="s2">system is that the economically dominant</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:19.390" style="s2">ones that will derive the profits from</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.500" end="00:10:22.510" style="s2">almost anything that&#39;s popular that just</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.390" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">how it works so cannabis is being</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.510" end="00:10:27.880" style="s2">legalized in Canada now it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:29.620" style="s2">the little growers there&#39;s no really</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.880" end="00:10:31.900" style="s2">profit it&#39;s gonna be huge corporations</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.620" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna take advantage of the tax</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.900" end="00:10:37.330" style="s2">structure and the whole economic setup</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:43.470" style="s2">to make enormous profits that&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.330" end="00:10:43.470" style="s2">it works the thing with the psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.480" end="00:10:51.230" style="s2">saith ayahuasca it&#39;s not a product that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.010" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">people will use everyday so when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.230" end="00:10:56.120" style="s2">make prozac people have to use it daily</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:58.510" style="s2">in fact they use it daily for years now</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.120" end="00:11:01.640" style="s2">ask us something love ceremonies with</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.510" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">two or three times a year if your</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.640" end="00:11:06.230" style="s2">devotee if you&#39;re a follower so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:10.100" style="s2">as profitable because you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:12.890" style="s2">sell mass products to a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.100" end="00:11:16.340" style="s2">people on a daily basis so there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.890" end="00:11:18.680" style="s2">risk with that but if psilocybin becomes</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.340" end="00:11:22.910" style="s2">useful as I say as a micro dose</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.680" end="00:11:25.970" style="s2">I can see corporations moving in under</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.910" end="00:11:28.280" style="s2">the system I expect nothing else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.970" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">less amenable to that kind of profit</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.280" end="00:11:35.870" style="s2">motive because of the more intermittent</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:39.560" style="s2">nature of these experiences and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.870" end="00:11:41.330" style="s2">small quantities involved but nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.560" end="00:11:43.910" style="s2">immune to profit and it is a profit to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.330" end="00:11:48.400" style="s2">be made yes I expect the corporations to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.910" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">take advantage just going back to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.400" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">psychedelic therapy is there a sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:57.170" style="s2">that we can get insight from from these</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:59.420" style="s2">experiences but ultimately we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.170" end="00:12:04.130" style="s2">the work ourselves of integration and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.420" end="00:12:07.010" style="s2">healing well yeah I&#39;ve had deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.130" end="00:12:08.870" style="s2">experiences with psychedelics really</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.010" end="00:12:15.260" style="s2">deep insights I thought I understood the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.870" end="00:12:16.760" style="s2">world and I talked about this maybe 10</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.260" end="00:12:20.120" style="s2">years ago I let every treated ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.760" end="00:12:21.890" style="s2">and under the impact of the plant I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.120" end="00:12:23.840" style="s2">really a girl I mean I was really right</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.890" end="00:12:25.550" style="s2">on I was you know insightful and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.840" end="00:12:27.110" style="s2">compassionate and I could see through</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.550" end="00:12:30.770" style="s2">people&#39;s stuff and I would guide them to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.110" end="00:12:31.510" style="s2">reality and I thought ok hey I&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.770" end="00:12:35.420" style="s2">it folks</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.510" end="00:12:37.820" style="s2">then I&#39;ll arrive home and my wife just</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.420" end="00:12:40.010" style="s2">picks it up at the train station and she</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.820" end="00:12:41.140" style="s2">just had a haircut that story upset by</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.010" end="00:12:43.400" style="s2">all sudden life wasn&#39;t worth living</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.140" end="00:12:44.900" style="s2">because of this haircut that bad bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.400" end="00:12:47.390" style="s2">wife had so there&#39;s that this is unlike</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.900" end="00:12:49.460" style="s2">my god you know that&#39;s all of a sudden I</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.390" end="00:12:52.570" style="s2">look at my partner and I don&#39;t like what</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.460" end="00:12:54.260" style="s2">I see an awesome I get all this kondal a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.570" end="00:12:54.980" style="s2">discombobulated that&#39;s my particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.260" end="00:12:57.080" style="s2">neuroses</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.980" end="00:12:59.060" style="s2">but that dioica experience and all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.080" end="00:13:01.250" style="s2">answers I had they not liberate me from</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.060" end="00:13:04.220" style="s2">my neuroses or having to have my woman</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.250" end="00:13:07.700" style="s2">looking a certain way that&#39;s a dependent</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.220" end="00:13:10.790" style="s2">I still was so the greatest insights and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.700" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">experiences legion nowhere unless you</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.790" end="00:13:15.800" style="s2">integrate them and as you say that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:18.050" style="s2">integration takes work and so what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.800" end="00:13:21.110" style="s2">learned and what I emphasize more and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.050" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">more not affect when I&#39;m said most now</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.110" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">is the experience opens the door</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:29.240" style="s2">but you&#39;re the one has to walk through</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:31.460" style="s2">the door and having the window open or</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.240" end="00:13:33.530" style="s2">the door open does not get you to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.460" end="00:13:35.270" style="s2">other side and that&#39;s a lot of work and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.530" end="00:13:37.220" style="s2">so it&#39;s like with every other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.270" end="00:13:39.730" style="s2">spiritual work you can also have great</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.220" end="00:13:42.860" style="s2">realizations on a meditation question</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.730" end="00:13:47.000" style="s2">and people do have these direct</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.860" end="00:13:49.550" style="s2">experiences of godhood but it is them</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.000" end="00:13:52.220" style="s2">nowhere unless it transformed their</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.550" end="00:13:56.050" style="s2">lives and for the trance on their lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.220" end="00:13:59.480" style="s2">those intentions and those insights</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.050" end="00:14:02.630" style="s2">those intuitions need to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.480" end="00:14:04.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s the daily work and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.630" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">nothing that stops me so there I reckon</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.310" end="00:14:08.930" style="s2">I to say people if it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:11.000" style="s2">having great insights on the one hand or</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.930" end="00:14:13.430" style="s2">daily regular work on the other choose</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.630" end="00:17:15.990" style="s2">in a ceremony earlier this year and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.819" end="00:17:17.040" style="s2">somebody asked me what is the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.990" end="00:17:18.839" style="s2">life and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.040" end="00:17:20.610" style="s2">and the this is what I was under the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.839" end="00:17:24.300" style="s2">effect and the immediate answer that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.610" end="00:17:25.770" style="s2">came up is life is its own meaning which</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.300" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2">I thought was a great line</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.770" end="00:17:31.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that I can live that in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:34.230" style="s2">regular existence but I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.380" end="00:17:35.940" style="s2">the only answer that was needed but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.230" end="00:17:41.040" style="s2">takes a lot to recognize that life isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.520" end="00:17:48.990" style="s2">it appeared ten years ago I kept getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.340" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">a lot of questions about what I knew</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.990" end="00:17:53.550" style="s2">about psychedelic plants particularly</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:55.110" style="s2">ayahuasca and the treatment of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.550" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">and mansur was I knew nothing at all</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.270" end="00:18:02.010" style="s2">the question became somewhat annoying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:03.750" style="s2">me because I just spent three years</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.010" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">writing a book how about asking me</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.750" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">something I knew about rather than this</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:11.610" style="s2">is one thing I didn&#39;t know but it so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:14.250" style="s2">happened that I was exposed to the plant</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.610" end="00:18:18.450" style="s2">and I&#39;d opportunity to experience its</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.250" end="00:18:20.460" style="s2">impact myself and at the first use of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.450" end="00:18:23.160" style="s2">the plant within a ceremony led by a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.460" end="00:18:25.740" style="s2">Peruvian shaman I understood why people</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.160" end="00:18:31.980" style="s2">were curious about its potential to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.740" end="00:18:34.350" style="s2">with addiction because it provided a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.980" end="00:18:39.000" style="s2">deep root to my own soul and to my heart</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.350" end="00:18:41.130" style="s2">and also allowed me to observe just how</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.000" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">close my heart had been and of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.130" end="00:18:44.550" style="s2">the dictions</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:46.260" style="s2">are all about shutting down some parts</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.550" end="00:18:47.940" style="s2">of ourselves that we would then have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.260" end="00:18:52.820" style="s2">enliven through artificial means</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:55.260" style="s2">I was called this particular plant also</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.820" end="00:18:57.000" style="s2">sometimes gives people a deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.260" end="00:18:58.020" style="s2">their own suffering of what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.000" end="00:18:58.500" style="s2">they&#39;ve been running from all of our</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.500" end="00:19:02.760" style="s2">the addiction is all about running away</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.500" end="00:19:04.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a temporary running away for</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.760" end="00:19:09.810" style="s2">something unbearable which is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.020" end="00:19:11.730" style="s2">simple and the plant shows you what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.810" end="00:19:13.800" style="s2">be running from which can be painful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.730" end="00:19:17.970" style="s2">difficult but it shows you in a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.800" end="00:19:23.610" style="s2">compassionate way so both in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.970" end="00:19:26.310" style="s2">of connecting into a deep core self that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.610" end="00:19:27.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to run anywhere and in</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.170" end="00:19:32.750" style="s2">just what you&#39;ve been running away from</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.290" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">it can be a deep experience in the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.750" end="00:19:38.330" style="s2">context yeah I mean I found from my own</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:41.480" style="s2">experiences many of them have been a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.330" end="00:19:43.580" style="s2">sense of compassion combined with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.480" end="00:19:47.210" style="s2">of pain but I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.580" end="00:19:48.350" style="s2">this idea of around especially the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.210" end="00:19:50.450" style="s2">severely addicted people in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.350" end="00:19:52.430" style="s2">beginning of your book you know they it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.450" end="00:19:54.200" style="s2">seems that their pain is just it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.430" end="00:19:56.570" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the capacity to bear it</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.200" end="00:19:58.100" style="s2">well first of all none of us or they did</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.570" end="00:20:00.410" style="s2">have the capacity to bear pain otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.100" end="00:20:01.970" style="s2">it would be addicted the problem in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.410" end="00:20:03.650" style="s2">addiction is not the pain the problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.970" end="00:20:05.180" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know how to bear it now</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.650" end="00:20:07.040" style="s2">why is it that we don&#39;t know how to bear</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.180" end="00:20:09.830" style="s2">it because the first time that we</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.630" end="00:21:19.160" style="s2">and later on addictions so addictions</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:21.560" style="s2">are always about not knowing how to hold</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.160" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">pain but the more severe the pain is and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.560" end="00:21:25.940" style="s2">the more isolated the child is with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:28.310" style="s2">pain the greater the risk for addiction</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.940" end="00:21:30.620" style="s2">the cases I talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.310" end="00:21:31.220" style="s2">beginning of the book the really severe</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.620" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">drug</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.220" end="00:21:35.270" style="s2">as you said there were horrendous</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:38.330" style="s2">experiences and nobody to help them hold</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.270" end="00:21:42.140" style="s2">it hence their incapacity to hold a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.330" end="00:21:44.570" style="s2">thing as you&#39;re talking about that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.140" end="00:21:47.330" style="s2">also reminded of you&#39;ve talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.570" end="00:21:49.820" style="s2">about H almaas spiritual teacher who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.330" end="00:21:53.419" style="s2">also been very influential on on my life</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.820" end="00:21:55.730" style="s2">and the concept of inquiry which is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.419" end="00:21:59.419" style="s2">big you know kind of going in and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.730" end="00:22:01.970" style="s2">suppose a talking meditation you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.419" end="00:22:06.110" style="s2">mentioned that ayahuasca is you see it</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.970" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">as a process of inquiry as well and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.110" end="00:22:12.020" style="s2">that strikes me in some way because to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:13.820" style="s2">be able to inquire into for example our</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.020" end="00:22:15.950" style="s2">pain or whatever it is comes with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.820" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">sense of like implicit is a sense that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.950" end="00:22:21.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know and there&#39;s a kind of known</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:23.450" style="s2">as implicit sense that I don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.650" end="00:22:25.610" style="s2">there&#39;s also I&#39;m going to find out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.450" end="00:22:32.600" style="s2">there&#39;s also somebody there who&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.610" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">to find out here so pure pain if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.600" end="00:22:38.419" style="s2">no sense of the experience or just you</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">just want to escape from it but as soon</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.419" end="00:22:43.789" style="s2">as you say there&#39;s pain in me and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:46.039" style="s2">curious what that&#39;s about and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.789" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">willing to look at it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.039" end="00:22:50.530" style="s2">immediately a sense of the enquire which</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:54.380" style="s2">is no longer identified with the pain</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.530" end="00:22:58.100" style="s2">but is looking at it so that inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.380" end="00:23:00.260" style="s2">strengthens both our capacity to be with</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.100" end="00:23:03.860" style="s2">something and the person who is being</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.260" end="00:23:07.220" style="s2">with it and so for me the ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.860" end="00:23:10.370" style="s2">ceremony like many meditations is really</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.220" end="00:23:13.940" style="s2">an inquiry it&#39;s not about I won&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.370" end="00:23:17.690" style="s2">beautiful experience of unity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.940" end="00:23:19.370" style="s2">godness and angels and entities and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.690" end="00:23:22.610" style="s2">stars which some people have I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.370" end="00:23:24.919" style="s2">had one but it&#39;s about what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.610" end="00:23:26.350" style="s2">arise and how should I understand what</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.919" end="00:23:29.150" style="s2">arises</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.350" end="00:23:31.250" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m struck by the difference</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.150" end="00:23:33.770" style="s2">between that way of approaching contact</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.250" end="00:23:35.929" style="s2">with someone or or ourselves and what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.770" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">were talking about before with the very</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.929" end="00:23:41.570" style="s2">reactive nature of of social media yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">and you think by having those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.570" end="00:23:46.520" style="s2">dialogues with each other we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:49.250" style="s2">get somewhere you know get out of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.520" end="00:23:50.690" style="s2">box in a sense is there some healing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.250" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">just being able to have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.690" end="00:23:55.370" style="s2">like that well so in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:59.390" style="s2">ayahuasca ceremony at least the way I</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.370" end="00:24:01.909" style="s2">work with them there is contact before</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.390" end="00:24:04.039" style="s2">the seminary people share our purpose</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.909" end="00:24:05.210" style="s2">people indicate why they&#39;re there what</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.039" end="00:24:08.270" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for we help them</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.210" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">identify their intention then is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.270" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">ceremony and then after assembly once</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:16.190" style="s2">which people have slept and so on then</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">we talk about what what did you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.190" end="00:24:19.490" style="s2">experience and what meaning that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.960" end="00:24:22.760" style="s2">find it and then look over the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.490" end="00:24:25.610" style="s2">of the symbols that may be visited you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.760" end="00:24:27.320" style="s2">know divisions that you experienced or</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.610" end="00:24:32.450" style="s2">the insights that you gained or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.320" end="00:24:38.570" style="s2">physical sensations that your body went</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.450" end="00:24:40.700" style="s2">through and having that conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.570" end="00:24:42.169" style="s2">the context of the group immediately</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.700" end="00:24:45.289" style="s2">allows everybody&#39;s experience to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.169" end="00:24:47.539" style="s2">accompanied and shared and it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.289" end="00:24:51.380" style="s2">through that isolation that&#39;s so many of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.539" end="00:24:53.000" style="s2">us experienced and the people who have</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.380" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">been struggling with addiction and gone</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.000" end="00:24:56.510" style="s2">through a ceremony what what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:24:58.340" style="s2">what kind of things are they reporting</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.510" end="00:24:59.630" style="s2">afterwards about what what they</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.340" end="00:25:05.539" style="s2">experienced and how are their lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.630" end="00:25:07.880" style="s2">afterwards well I&#39;ve seen people break</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.539" end="00:25:12.260" style="s2">through significant addictions by means</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.880" end="00:25:14.390" style="s2">of I was the semis behavior addictions</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.260" end="00:25:19.159" style="s2">drug addictions and so on but it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.390" end="00:25:21.020" style="s2">cocaine or sex having said that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.159" end="00:25:22.610" style="s2">context and the follow-up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.020" end="00:25:25.370" style="s2">integration have to be there in other</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.610" end="00:25:27.080" style="s2">words for most people it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.370" end="00:25:29.179" style="s2">enough to have a beautiful experience of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.080" end="00:25:30.409" style="s2">a deeply meaningful experience what are</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.179" end="00:25:33.470" style="s2">they gonna do with that in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.409" end="00:25:35.090" style="s2">that&#39;s a real an ideation and in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.470" end="00:25:39.580" style="s2">downtown east side of Vancouver which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.090" end="00:25:41.830" style="s2">a concentrated area of drug use right do</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.580" end="00:25:44.179" style="s2">spend quite some time in the book</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.830" end="00:25:48.289" style="s2">explaining and depicting the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.179" end="00:25:50.419" style="s2">these people these people come to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.289" end="00:25:53.059" style="s2">ceremony they might have beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.419" end="00:25:54.110" style="s2">powerful insights and really get aspects</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.059" end="00:25:57.529" style="s2">of themselves that they&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.110" end="00:25:59.210" style="s2">experienced but then they go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.529" end="00:26:02.210" style="s2">Downtown Eastside there&#39;s no supportive</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.210" end="00:26:05.000" style="s2">context they&#39;ll relapse into their</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.210" end="00:26:06.679" style="s2">addiction and I&#39;ve seen that so one</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.000" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">mustn&#39;t idealize the ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.679" end="00:26:10.070" style="s2">experience is kind of the be-all and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:14.270" style="s2">end-all there has to be a supportive</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.070" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">ongoing integrative context so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.270" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">about a h almaas and I&#39;m curious how how</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:21.529" style="s2">has his work influenced your own</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">approach to your work and maybe to your</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.529" end="00:26:27.110" style="s2">life as well I&#39;ve had a number of I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:29.960" style="s2">never had a spiritual mentor does not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.110" end="00:26:31.879" style="s2">somebody that I&#39;ve followed or but</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.960" end="00:26:33.859" style="s2">really join their group or</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.879" end="00:26:39.079" style="s2">or attending their teachings</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.859" end="00:26:41.119" style="s2">consistently might question why I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.079" end="00:26:44.299" style="s2">haven&#39;t done that but basically I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.119" end="00:26:45.349" style="s2">a guru type but but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.299" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t learned from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.349" end="00:26:52.519" style="s2">people I have animus hamid ali&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:55.940" style="s2">real name a charmer sis&#39;s non-deployment</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.519" end="00:26:59.719" style="s2">huge he&#39;s been a influential teacher in</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.940" end="00:27:01.849" style="s2">my life he&#39;s got these deep spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.719" end="00:27:03.409" style="s2">teachings which you have to say many of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.849" end="00:27:05.659" style="s2">them I don&#39;t understand like he talks</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.409" end="00:27:07.009" style="s2">about stuff I have no idea about because</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.659" end="00:27:10.399" style="s2">he said he&#39;s a deep spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.009" end="00:27:15.190" style="s2">experiences of unity and transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.399" end="00:27:19.489" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t so the language he uses I</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.190" end="00:27:21.949" style="s2">can only wonder about having said that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.489" end="00:27:23.269" style="s2">there&#39;s two major things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.949" end="00:27:25.909" style="s2">learned from him which are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.269" end="00:27:28.249" style="s2">essential to my understanding one is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.909" end="00:27:29.989" style="s2">formation of the personality we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.249" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">identify with the personality we think</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.989" end="00:27:34.879" style="s2">we are a personality all most points out</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:38.289" style="s2">through a combination of Western</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.879" end="00:27:40.940" style="s2">psychology and Eastern spiritual thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.289" end="00:27:43.839" style="s2">that the personality a false construct</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.940" end="00:27:48.259" style="s2">but the personality really is a defense</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.839" end="00:27:50.809" style="s2">against loss a defense against pain and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.259" end="00:27:54.109" style="s2">so much of what we think of ourselves is</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.809" end="00:27:56.859" style="s2">actually a defensive structure and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.109" end="00:28:01.309" style="s2">mustn&#39;t take it to be a reality and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.859" end="00:28:03.259" style="s2">underneath the false personality the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.309" end="00:28:06.199" style="s2">defensive personality there&#39;s a core</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.259" end="00:28:08.449" style="s2">self and that core self can recognize</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.199" end="00:28:11.269" style="s2">the falseness of the personality and can</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.449" end="00:28:13.249" style="s2">transcend it and he provides ways of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.269" end="00:28:17.239" style="s2">working it through and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.249" end="00:28:19.729" style="s2">sophisticated in in explaining the with</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.370" end="00:29:15.800" style="s2">which is the true nature of all of us</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.800" end="00:29:22.760" style="s2">and our miss directions so in those</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.640" end="00:29:24.050" style="s2">senses and then his inquiry has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.760" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">very inspiring to me so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.050" end="00:29:31.490" style="s2">main things I&#39;ve learned from him again</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.190" end="00:29:38.420" style="s2">realms I don&#39;t follow him there I just</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.220" end="00:29:43.240" style="s2">haven&#39;t done that work I haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.420" end="00:29:45.620" style="s2">that experience but I do believe in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.240" end="00:29:48.650" style="s2">that he&#39;s talking about genuine human</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.620" end="00:29:50.540" style="s2">experience and his own experience the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.650" end="00:29:52.490" style="s2">concept of essence and the false</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.540" end="00:29:54.920" style="s2">personalities is one of the most useful</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.490" end="00:29:57.560" style="s2">concepts for me from amis as well and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.920" end="00:29:59.060" style="s2">I&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve if there was any</p>

<p begin="00:29:59.060" end="00:30:07.190" style="s2">down in some last question again was</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:08.300" style="s2">that down any side sorry so I&#39;m I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.190" end="00:30:10.490" style="s2">curious</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.490" end="00:30:14.780" style="s2">for almost is very very real and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.770" end="00:30:16.370" style="s2">experienced that in myself and seen it</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.780" end="00:30:18.770" style="s2">seen it in others and I&#39;m just wondering</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.770" end="00:30:22.520" style="s2">working with the people you were working</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.930" end="00:30:25.510" style="s2">with whether there were moments where</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.520" end="00:30:28.580" style="s2">you could kind of see an essence in I</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.510" end="00:30:30.200" style="s2">could see it a lot of the time the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.580" end="00:30:33.470" style="s2">tragedy is that the people themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.200" end="00:30:35.330" style="s2">don&#39;t see it they don&#39;t see their own</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.740" end="00:30:47.000" style="s2">identified with and of course society</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.750" end="00:30:50.870" style="s2">for the most part mirrors back to them</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.000" end="00:30:52.850" style="s2">the negative sense of self in essence as</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.700" end="00:31:03.720" style="s2">but I I&#39;ve had more than a few glimpses</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:06.270" style="s2">of it and there&#39;s that tragedy between</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.720" end="00:31:06.930" style="s2">neither with somebody&#39;s essence and who</p>
