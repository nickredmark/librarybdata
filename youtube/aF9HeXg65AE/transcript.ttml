<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">doing is I would argue also getting into</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">the flow state so the flow state has</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">become something that discussed both</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">academically and in the popular culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">it was made famous in work by chicks at</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">ma high his book flow the flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:52.019" style="s2">experience brought it to the forefront</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:55.319" style="s2">in 1990 so what is the flow experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.019" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">so the flow experience is experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.319" end="00:04:00.389" style="s2">people get into they often describe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">as like being in the zone so you are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.389" end="00:04:05.160" style="s2">involved in a task that is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">demanding in fact it has a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.160" end="00:04:14.880" style="s2">structure to it so these are your skills</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:18.389" style="s2">and these is how demanding the situation</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.880" end="00:04:20.539" style="s2">is right and the flow state is one in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.389" end="00:04:24.740" style="s2">which the demands of the situation just</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.539" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">slightly go beyond your skill abilities</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.740" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">and so you get what&#39;s called here</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:33.599" style="s2">Csikszentmihalyi often represents this</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:36.030" style="s2">by the flow channel right when my skills</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.599" end="00:04:37.200" style="s2">can just through we&#39;ll talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.030" end="00:04:38.350" style="s2">through like sort of insight and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.200" end="00:04:42.340" style="s2">restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.350" end="00:04:43.930" style="s2">I can just enough exact and extend my</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.340" end="00:04:46.180" style="s2">skills to meet the demand so I have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.930" end="00:04:47.860" style="s2">put everything I&#39;ve got into it then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.180" end="00:04:50.580" style="s2">get into the flow channel if my skills</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.860" end="00:04:55.270" style="s2">exceed the demands I fall into boredom</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.580" end="00:04:57.550" style="s2">if my demands exceed the skills alright</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.270" end="00:04:59.710" style="s2">I fall into anxiety now of course the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.550" end="00:05:02.740" style="s2">thing about you is you&#39;re very good at</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.710" end="00:05:06.310" style="s2">learning in situation so you need a kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.740" end="00:05:08.470" style="s2">of context in which your skills as your</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.310" end="00:05:11.770" style="s2">skills improve your environment also</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.470" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">improves so one of the things we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.770" end="00:05:18.730" style="s2">created in our culture if we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:22.050" style="s2">created flow induction machines because</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.730" end="00:05:24.070" style="s2">what what those machines that have are a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.050" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">situation where your skills are</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.070" end="00:05:27.700" style="s2">constantly improving and the demands on</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">the environment are constantly improving</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.700" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">and the skill induction these are these</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:34.540" style="s2">flow induction machines have other</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:36.280" style="s2">properties that are very important in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.540" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">them there&#39;s a very tight feedback</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.280" end="00:05:39.910" style="s2">between what you do and how the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:43.570" style="s2">environment responds you&#39;re getting very</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.910" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">clear information and failure matters</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.570" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like at least symbolically because</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">you can die and of course some of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:53.380" style="s2">are probably realizing that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:57.130" style="s2">about video games video games are one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.380" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">the most reliable ways of inducing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.130" end="00:06:02.590" style="s2">flow state in people in fact part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.390" style="s2">reasons why video games are addictive</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.590" end="00:06:05.950" style="s2">and they now being considered to be a</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.950" end="00:06:10.840" style="s2">Organization is precisely because they</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.500" end="00:06:11.860" style="s2">engender the flow state addictions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.840" end="00:06:13.420" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about this later when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.860" end="00:06:15.430" style="s2">about addictions addictions runoff</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.420" end="00:06:18.610" style="s2">machinery that is evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.430" end="00:06:24.100" style="s2">adaptive that&#39;s why it&#39;s compelling</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.610" end="00:06:25.480" style="s2">so the flow state what are other things</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.100" end="00:06:28.030" style="s2">that people do to get into the flow</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.850" end="00:06:34.570" style="s2">that&#39;s particularly interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.920" end="00:06:37.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no other explanation for why</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.570" end="00:06:39.760" style="s2">people do it other than you get into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.240" end="00:06:41.800" style="s2">flow state is rock climbing because rock</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.760" end="00:06:43.420" style="s2">climbing otherwise would be like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.800" end="00:06:45.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like some sort of torture from</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.270" end="00:07:02.360" style="s2">torturous thing to do well we know why</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.380" end="00:07:04.460" style="s2">people rock climb they rock climb</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.360" end="00:07:07.370" style="s2">because they get into the flow state and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.460" end="00:07:08.930" style="s2">the flow state is deeply deeply positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.370" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">for people it&#39;s not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.930" end="00:07:15.560" style="s2">physical pleasure right in fact the flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:18.650" style="s2">state is much more connected to meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.560" end="00:07:20.990" style="s2">in life in fact the more often you get</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.650" end="00:07:23.210" style="s2">into the flow State the more likely you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.990" end="00:07:25.790" style="s2">will rate your your life as a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.210" end="00:07:28.640" style="s2">the more the more you will experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.790" end="00:07:30.530" style="s2">well-being now what&#39;s interesting also</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.640" end="00:07:31.820" style="s2">about the flow State and remember we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.530" end="00:07:34.580" style="s2">doing this because I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.820" end="00:07:36.440" style="s2">that shamanism is probably a practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.580" end="00:07:39.590" style="s2">for practicing getting into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.440" end="00:07:41.710" style="s2">state so remember that right the thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.590" end="00:07:45.170" style="s2">about the flow state it&#39;s a universal</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.710" end="00:07:49.610" style="s2">people across cultures socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.170" end="00:07:52.550" style="s2">groups genders language environments age</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.610" end="00:07:55.040" style="s2">groups report being able to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.550" end="00:07:57.860" style="s2">flow state and they describe it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.040" end="00:08:00.770" style="s2">detail almost exactly the same way</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.860" end="00:08:02.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a universal and universals are</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.770" end="00:08:04.850" style="s2">important in cognitive science you pay</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.780" end="00:08:06.770" style="s2">attention to the universals because they</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.850" end="00:08:10.580" style="s2">give you profound insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.770" end="00:08:13.760" style="s2">machinery what&#39;s it like to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.580" end="00:08:16.700" style="s2">flow state well when you&#39;re in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.760" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">state right you feel like you&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.700" end="00:08:21.560" style="s2">at one with things so for example I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:24.980" style="s2">martial artist and when I&#39;m sparring</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.560" end="00:08:28.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like my sense of connectedness to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.980" end="00:08:32.540" style="s2">my opponent is really enhanced and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.130" end="00:08:36.349" style="s2">really at one and that comes with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.540" end="00:08:38.840" style="s2">this kind of spontaneity so when one</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.349" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">does when a strike is coming to my hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.840" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">is just it I don&#39;t sort of raise your</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:49.270" style="s2">head now John it flows out of me hence</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:49.270" style="s2">the word right and the block is there</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:55.250" style="s2">the hockey player the goalie just puts</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.180" end="00:08:57.590" style="s2">out his hand the glove hand and the puck</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.250" end="00:08:59.870" style="s2">is there there&#39;s this tremendous sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.590" end="00:09:02.900" style="s2">of at one MIT and then closely allied to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.870" end="00:09:06.400" style="s2">it is this right</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.900" end="00:09:08.900" style="s2">at one level you know like the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.400" end="00:09:12.350" style="s2">dancing or chanting that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:14.570" style="s2">tremendous metabolic energy at work</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.350" end="00:09:18.589" style="s2">effort you&#39;re making at one level all</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.570" end="00:09:20.930" style="s2">this effort but at another level</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.589" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">it feels effortless that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.930" end="00:09:27.400" style="s2">spontaneity again it just seems to flow</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:34.339" style="s2">from you your sense of time is passing</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.400" end="00:09:38.029" style="s2">differently your sense of self is being</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.339" end="00:09:42.170" style="s2">dramatically altered so when people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.029" end="00:09:45.020" style="s2">in the flow state right their self kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.170" end="00:09:46.040" style="s2">of self-consciousness disappears that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.020" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">self-consciously</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:49.100" style="s2">you know we carry around that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:51.020" style="s2">self-consciousness that that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.100" end="00:09:52.250" style="s2">doing this this sort of thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.020" end="00:09:54.440" style="s2">constantly sort of doing our</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.250" end="00:09:55.910" style="s2">autobiography how&#39;s my day going how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.440" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">doing who am i what am i doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.910" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">blah blah and it&#39;s also checking how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:00.830" style="s2">i image management how do I look what</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:02.870" style="s2">are people think of me how am i doing am</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.830" end="00:10:05.810" style="s2">i under threat all of that nattering and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.870" end="00:10:07.370" style="s2">all my failing I was I knew and and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.810" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">of course and that can get out of hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2">and was like when you&#39;re in depression</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:13.700" style="s2">you ruminate on all that stuff and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.480" end="00:10:15.500" style="s2">overwhelms you but we all carry that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.700" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">burden around it&#39;s taxing and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.500" end="00:10:22.430" style="s2">in the flow state it&#39;s gone because</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:27.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no space for all of that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.430" end="00:10:30.170" style="s2">you&#39;re so right engrossed in the task</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.820" end="00:10:34.670" style="s2">the other thing about the flow state is</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.170" end="00:10:35.810" style="s2">it&#39;s super salient like it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.670" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">like like it&#39;s like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.810" end="00:10:42.190" style="s2">brightness and vividness you get in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:47.770" style="s2">video game the world seems more intense</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.190" end="00:10:47.770" style="s2">and people really like this experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.860" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">and not only do they like it it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.790" end="00:10:56.779" style="s2">be where they do their best work</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:59.300" style="s2">so the flow experience is an optimal</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.779" end="00:11:01.970" style="s2">experience in two ways many people</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.300" end="00:11:06.050" style="s2">regard it as the best experiences they</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.970" end="00:11:08.870" style="s2">can have but it&#39;s also where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.050" end="00:11:13.490" style="s2">doing their very best at what they want</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.870" end="00:11:17.380" style="s2">to excel in that&#39;s why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.490" end="00:11:17.380" style="s2">motivating to get into the flow State</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:33.140" style="s2">so why is the flow state so good so this</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.730" end="00:11:36.440" style="s2">year 2018 I published some work with</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.140" end="00:11:40.130" style="s2">Adrian Havana and Leo Ferraro in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.440" end="00:11:41.690" style="s2">we tried to argue for what the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.130" end="00:11:44.330" style="s2">mechanisms are in the flow States see</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.690" end="00:11:46.100" style="s2">chicks at mahai tells you the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.330" end="00:11:48.650" style="s2">environmental conditions what you need</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.100" end="00:11:56.360" style="s2">in order to get into the flow state you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.650" end="00:11:59.030" style="s2">need skills and demand to be matched you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.360" end="00:12:00.920" style="s2">need to be very tight coupling between</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.030" end="00:12:02.960" style="s2">you and the environment like in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.920" end="00:12:04.610" style="s2">video game you need very clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.960" end="00:12:06.950" style="s2">information it can&#39;t be ambiguous or</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.610" end="00:12:09.280" style="s2">vague and failure has to matter it has</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.950" end="00:12:12.260" style="s2">to be costly to you in some fashion</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.280" end="00:12:14.180" style="s2">specified all of that you also specified</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.260" end="00:12:17.050" style="s2">the kind of training that helps enhance</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.180" end="00:12:20.750" style="s2">you get to get you into the flow State</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.050" end="00:12:24.140" style="s2">and think about this think about what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.750" end="00:12:26.780" style="s2">said last time and we&#39;re gonna explore</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.140" end="00:12:27.890" style="s2">this more training and mindfulness the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.780" end="00:12:29.840" style="s2">more people have training and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.890" end="00:12:32.270" style="s2">mindfulness increases their capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.840" end="00:12:34.070" style="s2">get into the flow state now can we come</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.270" end="00:12:38.510" style="s2">up with a unified explanation for all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.070" end="00:12:40.370" style="s2">this I think we can both for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.510" end="00:12:42.080" style="s2">phenomenology why we&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.370" end="00:12:45.170" style="s2">what we&#39;re experiencing when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.080" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">the flow State and why is it improving</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.170" end="00:12:50.750" style="s2">your cognition and therefore why would</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.170" end="00:12:52.340" style="s2">the shaman be enhancing their cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.750" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">by getting into something like the flow</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.340" end="00:13:00.470" style="s2">state through their ritual practices ok</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:04.040" style="s2">so think about the rock climber okay the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.470" end="00:13:05.660" style="s2">rock climber is climbing remember we</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.040" end="00:13:08.330" style="s2">talked about how you frame and find</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.660" end="00:13:11.830" style="s2">patterns last time remember the nine dot</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.330" end="00:13:14.060" style="s2">problem right and that these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.830" end="00:13:16.130" style="s2">aren&#39;t just patterns in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.060" end="00:13:17.570" style="s2">they&#39;re patterns in how knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.130" end="00:13:21.470" style="s2">make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.570" end="00:13:24.500" style="s2">so you&#39;re rock climbing and if that</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.470" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">breaks down you impasse you&#39;re stuck and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.500" end="00:13:29.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean just cognitively you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:29.820" style="s2">physically stuck now if you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.180" end="00:13:31.470" style="s2">good rock</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.820" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">what you have to do is you have to break</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.470" end="00:13:38.820" style="s2">that framing you have to train yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:40.770" style="s2">to break the frame restructure change</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.820" end="00:13:44.730" style="s2">what you&#39;re finding relevant and salient</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.770" end="00:13:47.940" style="s2">and then change yourself to fit that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.730" end="00:13:52.280" style="s2">then you&#39;ve refit yourself to the rock</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.940" end="00:13:55.500" style="s2">face you refit yourself to the rock face</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.280" end="00:13:57.270" style="s2">then you have to do it again and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.500" end="00:13:58.110" style="s2">you have to do it again and then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.270" end="00:14:00.570" style="s2">have to do it again</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.110" end="00:14:02.430" style="s2">well the jazz musician the jazz musician</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.570" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2">is playing they pick up on a pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.430" end="00:14:05.640" style="s2">they play with it but they can&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.410" end="00:14:06.690" style="s2">with it too long whether they have to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.640" end="00:14:08.310" style="s2">they have to shift they have to</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.160" end="00:14:25.350" style="s2">on with the rock climber the jazz</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.020" end="00:14:29.670" style="s2">musician the martial artist is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.350" end="00:14:31.860" style="s2">of a cascade of insights you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.670" end="00:14:33.690" style="s2">an insight that&#39;s leading to another</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.860" end="00:14:37.200" style="s2">insight that&#39;s leading to another</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.690" end="00:14:38.400" style="s2">insight right it&#39;s priming so you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.200" end="00:14:41.070" style="s2">when you have like an insight you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.400" end="00:14:44.370" style="s2">like aha and you get that sort of burst</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.070" end="00:14:45.780" style="s2">of energy and it&#39;s like a flash that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.370" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">why we put a light bulb over somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.780" end="00:14:50.100" style="s2">head when we want to show them having an</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:55.010" style="s2">insight it&#39;s like that flash now imagine</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.100" end="00:14:55.010" style="s2">if I took that aha and I extended it aha</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.910" end="00:15:03.450" style="s2">that&#39;s the flow State it&#39;s an inchoate</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.550" end="00:15:09.780" style="s2">so the more you flow the more you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.450" end="00:15:12.770" style="s2">training your ability for insight in</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.780" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">direct interacting with your environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.770" end="00:15:16.380" style="s2">now the trouble of course with the video</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">game is year though the environment is</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.380" end="00:15:23.130" style="s2">into real world but in the shaman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:25.590" style="s2">world of course the shamans flowing in</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.130" end="00:15:29.010" style="s2">the real world the real social world the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.590" end="00:15:31.740" style="s2">real ecological world but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.010" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">something more it&#39;s not just an insight</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.740" end="00:15:35.010" style="s2">cascade that&#39;s going on and flow died it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:37.350" style="s2">died in and of itself would be great</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.010" end="00:15:39.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something else going this has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.350" end="00:15:42.120" style="s2">do with your capacity for implicit</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.240" end="00:15:43.860" style="s2">learning now notice what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.120" end="00:15:47.130" style="s2">here notice that although even I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.860" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">the history I&#39;m always also doing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.130" end="00:15:51.630" style="s2">cogs side because wall I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:54.420" style="s2">emphasizing the history the historical</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.630" end="00:15:55.980" style="s2">account I&#39;m starting to build what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.420" end="00:15:59.400" style="s2">need to give you the structural</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.980" end="00:16:04.950" style="s2">functional account ok so implicit</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.400" end="00:16:07.320" style="s2">learning this goes back to work done in</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.950" end="00:16:11.250" style="s2">the 60s by Arthur Reber and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.320" end="00:16:12.690" style="s2">bunch of other people so what Reber was</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.250" end="00:16:14.280" style="s2">doing is he he was really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.690" end="00:16:16.380" style="s2">understand how people learn language</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.280" end="00:16:18.540" style="s2">what he was doing was he was generating</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.380" end="00:16:20.430" style="s2">an arbitrary set of rules completely</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.540" end="00:16:23.010" style="s2">arbitrary just make them up on the spot</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.430" end="00:16:24.630" style="s2">set of rules for how you can link</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.010" end="00:16:26.850" style="s2">strings of letters and/or numbers</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.630" end="00:16:28.620" style="s2">together like the rule might be you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.850" end="00:16:30.750" style="s2">can&#39;t have more than three vowels in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.620" end="00:16:32.670" style="s2">row or you have to have two consonants</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.750" end="00:16:36.630" style="s2">and then you generate you generate</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.670" end="00:16:38.670" style="s2">letter strings eight nine long these are</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.630" end="00:16:40.080" style="s2">so long that you can&#39;t sort of easily</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.670" end="00:16:42.510" style="s2">hold them in your working memory and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.080" end="00:16:45.630" style="s2">then this is what you do you take you</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.510" end="00:16:46.950" style="s2">generate you can generate an indefinite</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.630" end="00:16:49.080" style="s2">number you generate a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.950" end="00:16:51.660" style="s2">these strings and you show them to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.080" end="00:16:55.050" style="s2">people here&#39;s one here&#39;s one here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.660" end="00:16:56.750" style="s2">here&#39;s one here&#39;s one here&#39;s one okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.050" end="00:16:59.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the first part of the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.750" end="00:16:59.670" style="s2">then you do the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:02.420" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.670" end="00:17:06.330" style="s2">now you generate a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.420" end="00:17:08.209" style="s2">strings but two kinds one set of strings</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.330" end="00:17:10.909" style="s2">is generated by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.209" end="00:17:12.860" style="s2">that artificial set of rules and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.909" end="00:17:16.159" style="s2">follows the same rules as the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.860" end="00:17:18.049" style="s2">string first set and then the second set</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.159" end="00:17:21.770" style="s2">is generated by a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.049" end="00:17:24.439" style="s2">set of rules okay and what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.770" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">mix up the first and the second together</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.439" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">and this is the task you give people can</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:35.620" style="s2">you tell me the strings that belong with</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:38.419" style="s2">the strings you saw before there you go</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.620" end="00:17:41.149" style="s2">now weber originally thought what would</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.419" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">happen is people would because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.149" end="00:17:47.630" style="s2">like so random what he found was people</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.590" end="00:17:49.549" style="s2">score well well above chance</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.630" end="00:17:52.190" style="s2">consistently on this people can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.549" end="00:17:54.110" style="s2">oh no those strings yeah those belong</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.190" end="00:17:55.820" style="s2">with though the old ones no that one</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.110" end="00:17:58.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that one does that one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.820" end="00:18:01.220" style="s2">now here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting you now</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.070" end="00:18:02.299" style="s2">ask people why how do you know that and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.220" end="00:18:05.539" style="s2">they&#39;ll give you one of two answers</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.299" end="00:18:11.299" style="s2">they&#39;ll say I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.539" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">just I just feel it which is whoo or</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.299" end="00:18:16.970" style="s2">they say they give you some explanation</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:18.529" style="s2">they&#39;ll give you some rule the procedure</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.970" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">they&#39;re using and here&#39;s what we know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.529" end="00:18:23.690" style="s2">they&#39;re deceiving themselves or lying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">you because that rule that they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.690" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t actually predict their success</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.120" end="00:18:33.890" style="s2">so you are picking up you have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.279" end="00:18:37.970" style="s2">tremendous capacity outside your</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.890" end="00:18:39.620" style="s2">conscious awareness right to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.970" end="00:18:43.429" style="s2">very complex patterns in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.620" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">environment and you say okay why what</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.429" end="00:18:46.370" style="s2">does this have to do with shamanism well</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:49.570" style="s2">hang on because we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.370" end="00:18:52.549" style="s2">shaman picking up on patterns last time</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.570" end="00:18:53.990" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to this let me talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.549" end="00:18:58.899" style="s2">an experiment that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.990" end="00:19:00.770" style="s2">so there was some work done on this idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.899" end="00:19:02.270" style="s2">you know the people have psychic</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.770" end="00:19:04.100" style="s2">abilities and there was a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.270" end="00:19:05.090" style="s2">being stared at the people can tell when</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.100" end="00:19:07.220" style="s2">they&#39;re being stared at and people</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.090" end="00:19:08.600" style="s2">reliably report that they think oh I</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.220" end="00:19:10.159" style="s2">knew somebody was staring I could just</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.600" end="00:19:12.470" style="s2">feel it in the back of my neck and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.159" end="00:19:13.580" style="s2">like that so they ran an experiment in</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.470" end="00:19:17.029" style="s2">which they did the following they&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:19.190" style="s2">somebody in a room blindfolded ear</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.029" end="00:19:20.360" style="s2">plugged the kids sense anything nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.190" end="00:19:21.980" style="s2">allowed to wear perfumes or anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.360" end="00:19:23.899" style="s2">that person can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.980" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">here feel and they&#39;re just standing in</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.899" end="00:19:29.450" style="s2">the room unbeknownst to that person</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:31.580" style="s2">and in people would come in and stare at</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.450" end="00:19:32.750" style="s2">them and then they had to report him the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.580" end="00:19:34.549" style="s2">person at the center of the room had to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.750" end="00:19:37.669" style="s2">reported they were being stared at or</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.549" end="00:19:40.159" style="s2">not and people were reporting this well</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.669" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">above chance they were saying I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.159" end="00:19:44.389" style="s2">I&#39;m being stared at and there was</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:48.409" style="s2">somebody there and of course first of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.389" end="00:19:53.929" style="s2">all there&#39;s ooh right but then it turned</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.409" end="00:19:57.019" style="s2">out that if you made a slight change to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.929" end="00:19:59.059" style="s2">that experiment it wouldn&#39;t replicate so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.019" end="00:20:03.350" style="s2">what was going on you bring people into</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.059" end="00:20:05.389" style="s2">the room and they say I think I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.350" end="00:20:07.730" style="s2">stared at and the researchers would tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.389" end="00:20:10.840" style="s2">them if they were correct or not they</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.730" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">would say you&#39;re right or you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.840" end="00:20:14.029" style="s2">so what&#39;d you say so what well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:16.899" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.029" end="00:20:19.909" style="s2">the researchers thought they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.899" end="00:20:22.820" style="s2">introducing people the viewers into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.909" end="00:20:24.110" style="s2">room randomly but it turns out they</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.820" end="00:20:25.399" style="s2">weren&#39;t introducing them randomly</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.110" end="00:20:28.340" style="s2">because you know it&#39;s very hard for you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.399" end="00:20:32.419" style="s2">to do random stuff they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.340" end="00:20:35.539" style="s2">introducing people as viewers in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.419" end="00:20:37.700" style="s2">complex pattern and the person that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.539" end="00:20:40.250" style="s2">blindfolded and ear plugged was</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.700" end="00:20:42.409" style="s2">implicitly learning the pattern because</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:44.149" style="s2">they were getting feedback if you take</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.409" end="00:20:45.740" style="s2">the feedback away if you don&#39;t tell them</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.149" end="00:20:47.149" style="s2">whenever they say I&#39;m being stared out</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.740" end="00:20:49.190" style="s2">or not if you don&#39;t tell them they&#39;re -</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.149" end="00:20:53.389" style="s2">right or wrong their performance drops -</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.190" end="00:20:56.690" style="s2">chance see a lot of what looks like</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.389" end="00:20:59.570" style="s2">psychic abilities are your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.690" end="00:21:01.669" style="s2">pick up implicitly on complex patterns</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.100" end="00:21:12.110" style="s2">educating intuition made a really really</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.350" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">cool really cool claim makes a very good</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.110" end="00:21:17.750" style="s2">argument in fact I think for this he</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:21.080" style="s2">says that what we call intuition is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.750" end="00:21:22.909" style="s2">real thing but there isn&#39;t anything sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.080" end="00:21:25.399" style="s2">of magical about it in there like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.909" end="00:21:27.110" style="s2">psychics say or something like that your</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.399" end="00:21:31.549" style="s2">intuition is the result of your implicit</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.110" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">learning you pick up on all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.549" end="00:21:34.490" style="s2">complex patterns not knowing how you</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.490" end="00:21:40.520" style="s2">and but you get an ability to detect</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:42.380" style="s2">patterns and you don&#39;t know how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.520" end="00:21:45.650" style="s2">why your intuition feels the way it does</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.380" end="00:21:48.200" style="s2">you just sort of know like you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.650" end="00:21:49.970" style="s2">things you&#39;re doing it all the time to</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.970" end="00:21:58.610" style="s2">know how far to stand from somebody and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:00.200" style="s2">what angle to stick like where you</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.570" end="00:22:13.370" style="s2">but rather to ask you to tell me how you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.100" end="00:22:16.820" style="s2">do that you wouldn&#39;t know you would just</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.370" end="00:22:19.220" style="s2">say I know how to do it and yet when</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.820" end="00:22:25.790" style="s2">people don&#39;t know how to do it it creeps</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">you out it creeps you out okay so</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.790" end="00:22:31.130" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:32.870" style="s2">now hogarth points out and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.130" end="00:22:34.790" style="s2">something very common right hold our</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.870" end="00:22:35.720" style="s2">points so that you know we have two</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.790" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">different terms and we don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.720" end="00:22:41.420" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the same thing we</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:41.690" style="s2">have intuition when we think it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.420" end="00:22:45.050" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.690" end="00:22:48.680" style="s2">that implicit learning but we also have</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.680" end="00:22:54.500" style="s2">that implicit learning goes bad the</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.500" end="00:23:02.060" style="s2">that are wrong now why is how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.260" end="00:23:05.750" style="s2">implicit learning goes wrong well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.060" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">the thing you have some complex pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.750" end="00:23:12.200" style="s2">in the environment right and your</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:14.030" style="s2">implicit learning picks up on it the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.200" end="00:23:14.920" style="s2">problem is there&#39;s two kinds of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.030" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">in your environment</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.920" end="00:23:20.030" style="s2">there&#39;s correlations there&#39;s correlation</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:22.370" style="s2">patterns and causal parts on what do I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.030" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">mean by the correlations is what any two</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.370" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">things are related to each other so let</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.440" style="s2">me give you an example of a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.750" style="s2">correlations that you shouldn&#39;t confuse</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.440" end="00:23:35.270" style="s2">with causation there is a correlation</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.750" end="00:23:38.690" style="s2">between how large your wedding is and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.270" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">how long your marriage will last if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.690" end="00:23:44.750" style="s2">have a bigger wedding your marriage will</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:46.100" style="s2">last longer now you would be a fool to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.750" end="00:23:47.780" style="s2">therefore think you should have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.100" end="00:23:50.870" style="s2">biggest possible wedding</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.780" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">because the reason why bigger weddings</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.870" end="00:23:56.030" style="s2">predict longer marriages is not because</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:59.030" style="s2">bigger weddings cause longer marriages</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.030" end="00:24:01.040" style="s2">is because right there only correlated</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.030" end="00:24:03.320" style="s2">it&#39;s because bigger weddings reflect a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.040" end="00:24:05.780" style="s2">bigger social network more financial</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.320" end="00:24:07.700" style="s2">resources and having a bigger social</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.780" end="00:24:09.920" style="s2">network for the couple having more</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.700" end="00:24:12.500" style="s2">financial resources actually does cause</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.920" end="00:24:13.150" style="s2">a marriage to last longer here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.500" end="00:24:17.870" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.150" end="00:24:19.970" style="s2">so I&#39;m old enough right and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.870" end="00:24:22.250" style="s2">brought up in a religious household that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.970" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">I was you know when prayer was taken out</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.250" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">of the schools and of course people were</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.420" style="s2">very upset about that and you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:30.710" style="s2">look at crime as going up as we&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.420" end="00:24:31.400" style="s2">prayer out of the schools and things</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.710" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.400" end="00:24:34.930" style="s2">by the way crime hasn&#39;t been going up</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:37.280" style="s2">and read some of Steven Pinker&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.930" end="00:24:39.290" style="s2">but let&#39;s say it was that&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.280" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">correlation because here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.290" end="00:24:46.730" style="s2">correlation we know that greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:48.440" style="s2">gases have been going up steadily and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.730" end="00:24:49.700" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the environmental crisis</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.440" end="00:24:51.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about you know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.700" end="00:24:53.720" style="s2">has been also consistently going down</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.410" end="00:24:56.150" style="s2">for the exact same time period Caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.720" end="00:24:57.860" style="s2">piracy having pirates in the Caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.150" end="00:25:00.740" style="s2">and wooden ships with cannons and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.860" end="00:25:03.080" style="s2">as that went down greenhouse gases went</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.740" end="00:25:06.650" style="s2">up now I hope none of you think that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.080" end="00:25:11.510" style="s2">could solve global warming by being back</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.650" end="00:25:13.310" style="s2">piracy ok so there are many things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.510" end="00:25:15.740" style="s2">there are many patterns in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.310" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">that are illusory because they&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.740" end="00:25:21.170" style="s2">correlational they&#39;re not causal see the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.590" end="00:25:25.100" style="s2">big yet has picked up on correlational</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.170" end="00:25:27.970" style="s2">patterns not causal patterns so what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.100" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">want to do is you want to train your</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.970" end="00:25:34.520" style="s2">implicit learning to pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">causal patterns that are real rather</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.070" end="00:25:45.470" style="s2">can&#39;t tell people to look for patterns</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.740" end="00:25:47.630" style="s2">explicitly go back to rebirth experiment</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.470" end="00:25:48.470" style="s2">if you put people into that experiment</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.630" end="00:25:50.090" style="s2">where they&#39;re looking at the letter</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.470" end="00:25:51.500" style="s2">strings and you tell them explicitly</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.500" end="00:25:55.420" style="s2">figure out the rules consciously</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.420" end="00:26:00.890" style="s2">their performance doesn&#39;t get better it</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:05.250" style="s2">gets worse</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.890" end="00:26:07.650" style="s2">okay and hogarth notes this in his book</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.250" end="00:26:09.570" style="s2">on educating intuition we can&#39;t replace</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.650" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">implicit learning with explicit learning</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.570" end="00:26:14.730" style="s2">because it is precisely by being</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:17.400" style="s2">implicit that it works so well what can</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.730" end="00:26:20.730" style="s2">we do explicitly then what we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.400" end="00:26:23.910" style="s2">set up the right context the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.730" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">environmental factors so that my</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:31.860" style="s2">likely to get on to causal patterns</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.310" end="00:26:34.560" style="s2">rather than correlational patterns so</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.860" end="00:26:40.050" style="s2">I&#39;ll get good intuition rather than bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.560" end="00:26:41.970" style="s2">intuition how do you do that well Hogar</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.050" end="00:26:44.250" style="s2">says the way you would do this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.970" end="00:26:46.800" style="s2">way you do science you want to control</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.250" end="00:26:49.470" style="s2">the context right</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.330" end="00:26:55.170" style="s2">science is a way of distinguishing</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.830" end="00:27:13.380" style="s2">make sure that everything is very</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.460" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">clearly measured I get very clear</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:23.460" style="s2">make sure I&#39;m looking to see that right</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.790" end="00:27:25.470" style="s2">that the change in one variable is</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.740" end="00:27:50.370" style="s2">want to put you into an implicit</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.470" end="00:28:57.179" style="s2">got going on here the shaman is getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.169" end="00:28:59.100" style="s2">into the flow state is developing all</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.179" end="00:29:05.220" style="s2">these techniques for getting into this</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:29.970" style="s2">very complex real complex patterns now</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.740" end="00:29:49.320" style="s2">and then the implicit learning picks up</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.370" end="00:29:51.210" style="s2">those new plans and then those new</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.600" end="00:31:00.120" style="s2">effect to help them to heal right now so</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.450" end="00:31:02.070" style="s2">getting into the flow state notice</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.120" end="00:31:03.540" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here notice you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.070" end="00:31:05.850" style="s2">getting something that&#39;s almost like a</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.830" end="00:31:15.960" style="s2">the shaman is making meaning they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.560" end="00:31:18.120" style="s2">singing they&#39;re dancing they&#39;re telling</p>

<p begin="00:31:32.040" end="00:31:37.900" style="s2">what does that mean why would that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.650" end="00:31:40.030" style="s2">empower the upper paleolithic transition</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.900" end="00:31:45.610" style="s2">well first of all this is enhancing your</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.030" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">cognition but and this is goes towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.610" end="00:31:51.070" style="s2">the work of Michael Winckelmann and also</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:54.220" style="s2">not Rossano what&#39;s happening in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.070" end="00:31:56.440" style="s2">state is your brain is learning to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.220" end="00:31:57.990" style="s2">areas to talk to each other that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.440" end="00:32:00.970" style="s2">normally don&#39;t talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.990" end="00:32:02.620" style="s2">this is especially the case if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.970" end="00:32:06.730" style="s2">gone through a massive disruption</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.620" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">strategy fasting social isolation taking</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.730" end="00:32:13.060" style="s2">psychedelics because what if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:16.390" style="s2">a brain scan of somebody who&#39;s having a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.060" end="00:32:18.580" style="s2">psychedelic experience areas of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.390" end="00:32:20.380" style="s2">brain that do not not normally do not</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.580" end="00:32:24.310" style="s2">talk to each other are talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.380" end="00:32:26.140" style="s2">other now now if I were just to do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.310" end="00:32:27.610" style="s2">to you if I was just to get areas to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.140" end="00:32:33.070" style="s2">talk to each other you&#39;d experience that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.610" end="00:32:37.060" style="s2">as noise but if you&#39;ve got enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.070" end="00:32:38.710" style="s2">insight and enhanced intuition those</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.060" end="00:32:42.070" style="s2">areas are now talking to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.710" end="00:32:44.470" style="s2">you can bridge between them you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.070" end="00:32:48.460" style="s2">connect them and now this is an ability</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">you take for granted you think it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.460" end="00:32:56.010" style="s2">just the normal part of your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:56.010" style="s2">this is your capacity for metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.970" end="00:33:04.170" style="s2">the word metaphor is itself a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.040" end="00:33:05.790" style="s2">it means to bridge to carry over to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.170" end="00:33:09.120" style="s2">connect things that are normally not</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.790" end="00:33:11.550" style="s2">connected and what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.120" end="00:33:15.210" style="s2">understand is how pervasive metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.550" end="00:33:19.980" style="s2">I showed you a little bit last time the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.210" end="00:33:22.920" style="s2">idea of a project but I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.980" end="00:33:26.700" style="s2">reflect now I notice the word reflect is</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.920" end="00:33:29.400" style="s2">a metaphor on how your thought and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.700" end="00:33:32.160" style="s2">language is filled with it with metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.400" end="00:33:35.330" style="s2">by the word that was a metaphor I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.160" end="00:33:40.050" style="s2">for example do you see what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.330" end="00:33:43.050" style="s2">do you get my point do you comprehend it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.050" end="00:33:47.850" style="s2">can you grasp it do you understand it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.050" end="00:33:53.040" style="s2">these are all metaphors I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.850" end="00:34:01.260" style="s2">halfway through this talk I hope it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.040" end="00:34:04.260" style="s2">not too hard for you do you see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.260" end="00:34:06.150" style="s2">pervasive and profound all of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.260" end="00:34:08.070" style="s2">cognition this is work done by Lake off</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.150" end="00:34:09.929" style="s2">and others I have some criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.070" end="00:34:14.270" style="s2">some of their theory but the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.929" end="00:34:19.260" style="s2">your cognition is field and functions</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.270" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">through metaphorical enhancement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.260" end="00:34:28.710" style="s2">just I think the case now why is</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:32.940" style="s2">metaphor so powerful because metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.710" end="00:34:38.160" style="s2">how you make creative connections</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.940" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">between ideas metaphorical cognition as</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.160" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">is at the heart of both science and art</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.660" end="00:34:53.160" style="s2">when the shamans are enhancing this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:56.340" style="s2">machinery they&#39;re connecting areas of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.160" end="00:34:58.770" style="s2">the brain that normally didn&#39;t talk to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.340" end="00:35:02.910" style="s2">each other and affording a massive</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.770" end="00:35:05.670" style="s2">enhancement in metaphor one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.910" end="00:35:07.050" style="s2">in which your cognition and meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.670" end="00:35:11.830" style="s2">altered states of consciousness come</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.050" end="00:35:17.550" style="s2">together is in how your</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.550" end="00:35:23.650" style="s2">generating metaphor in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:26.740" style="s2">insightful connections there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.650" end="00:35:30.280" style="s2">connection between how insightful how</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.740" end="00:35:31.960" style="s2">good a problem-solver you are and your</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.280" end="00:35:34.030" style="s2">capacity for metaphorical thought that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.960" end="00:35:36.010" style="s2">why when somebody is facing a problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.030" end="00:35:39.010" style="s2">and they need to restructure how they</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.010" end="00:35:44.740" style="s2">think about it we tell them to use an</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.010" end="00:35:49.150" style="s2">analogy to think of a metaphor so this</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.740" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">is the point the shaman is developing</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.150" end="00:35:53.890" style="s2">psycho technologies for altering the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:57.100" style="s2">state of consciousness to get into the</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.100" end="00:36:02.380" style="s2">already making them more insightful and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.350" end="00:36:07.740" style="s2">more intuitively powerful but it is also</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.380" end="00:36:11.170" style="s2">making them generators of metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.740" end="00:36:13.540" style="s2">literally providing people with the</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:40.360" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a lot of the themes that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.750" end="00:36:48.359" style="s2">we&#39;re going to develop coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.360" end="00:36:54.380" style="s2">fore here how much right the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.359" end="00:36:58.940" style="s2">is weaving together enhancing cognition</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.380" end="00:37:04.529" style="s2">altered states of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.940" end="00:37:06.660" style="s2">improving our capacity for making sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.529" end="00:37:15.930" style="s2">of the world literally making more</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.660" end="00:37:17.460" style="s2">meaning if you have if you&#39;re a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.930" end="00:37:19.019" style="s2">rather grew pand you have a shaman</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.460" end="00:37:23.190" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna out-compete groups that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.019" end="00:37:24.779" style="s2">don&#39;t there&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.190" end="00:37:28.589" style="s2">universal there&#39;s a reason why the flow</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.779" end="00:37:30.809" style="s2">phenomena is universal because this</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.589" end="00:37:34.339" style="s2">exact some of our most basic machinery</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.809" end="00:37:34.339" style="s2">enhances it in a powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.730" end="00:37:49.470" style="s2">now the shamans have a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.450" end="00:37:52.769" style="s2">kind of experience they go through this</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.470" end="00:37:54.450" style="s2">transformation they often experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.769" end="00:37:56.910" style="s2">what&#39;s called soul flight as if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.450" end="00:38:00.390" style="s2">gone to another world and they&#39;re flying</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.910" end="00:38:04.140" style="s2">through it this is the origin</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.390" end="00:38:08.180" style="s2">I mean think of how we&#39;ve come to this</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.140" end="00:38:08.180" style="s2">but this is the origin of getting high</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.269" end="00:38:14.339" style="s2">and the shaman does this the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.359" end="00:38:18.150" style="s2">experiences themselves as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.339" end="00:38:23.430" style="s2">flying above the world why why would the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.150" end="00:38:29.640" style="s2">brain generate that well think about</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.430" end="00:38:31.980" style="s2">this the shaman is getting a much more</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.640" end="00:38:34.650" style="s2">comprehensive grasp of more complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.980" end="00:38:37.079" style="s2">patterns but they&#39;re experiencing it</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.650" end="00:38:39.329" style="s2">mostly intuitively and metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.079" end="00:38:43.289" style="s2">where are you when you get a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.329" end="00:38:46.019" style="s2">picture of things you&#39;re above them how</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.289" end="00:38:48.839" style="s2">do we often explain this even to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.019" end="00:38:51.569" style="s2">ourselves metaphorically right you you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.839" end="00:38:56.519" style="s2">have oversight somebody who is in charge</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.569" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">of things has oversight of them or has</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.519" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">super vision of them do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.390" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">those are metaphors those are metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.030" end="00:39:13.490" style="s2">that are little whispers little echoes</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:16.460" style="s2">of shamanic flight flying over things</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.490" end="00:39:19.110" style="s2">getting a getting an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.460" end="00:39:23.310" style="s2">insightful grasp that is expressed</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.110" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">metaphorically of a deeper connection to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.310" end="00:39:30.000" style="s2">the world we&#39;re gonna pick up on all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:34.410" style="s2">these themes as we investigate more than</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.000" end="00:39:37.620" style="s2">machinery of meaning making they need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.410" end="00:39:39.410" style="s2">move forward now so I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.620" end="00:39:41.550" style="s2">another revolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.410" end="00:39:43.230" style="s2">this was the Upper Paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.550" end="00:39:45.840" style="s2">transition this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.230" end="00:39:48.570" style="s2">meaning-making machinery the altered</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.840" end="00:39:51.900" style="s2">altering consciousness the self</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.570" end="00:39:55.650" style="s2">transcending the flying above the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.900" end="00:39:57.510" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom associated with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.650" end="00:40:00.270" style="s2">lot of things that we consider spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.510" end="00:40:02.720" style="s2">and religious you see them all together</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.270" end="00:40:05.070" style="s2">that&#39;s the Upper Paleolithic transition</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.720" end="00:40:06.810" style="s2">now there is another important</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.070" end="00:40:08.660" style="s2">revolution that into that takes place</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.810" end="00:40:11.910" style="s2">around 10,000 BCE</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.660" end="00:40:15.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the Neolithic Revolution you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.910" end="00:40:18.630" style="s2">the invention of agriculture the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.090" end="00:40:23.300" style="s2">agriculture is important because it adds</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.630" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">to this machinery an important way</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.300" end="00:40:28.950" style="s2">because now individuals are part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:33.690" style="s2">complex societies and for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.950" end="00:40:36.300" style="s2">because of agriculture people start to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.690" end="00:40:39.420" style="s2">stay in one place for significant</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.300" end="00:40:41.610" style="s2">amounts of time so their relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.420" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">the environment to each other because</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.610" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">they&#39;re living with large groups of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:52.380" style="s2">strangers now and to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:54.950" style="s2">radically changes that goes to a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.380" end="00:40:58.440" style="s2">long period of development this world</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.950" end="00:41:04.680" style="s2">right of course then becomes the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.440" end="00:41:07.860" style="s2">world as stone gives way to metal and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.680" end="00:41:10.370" style="s2">get the Bronze Age the period of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.860" end="00:41:14.030" style="s2">first great civilizations in Mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.370" end="00:41:14.030" style="s2">in Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.940" end="00:41:21.819" style="s2">and there&#39;s a transformation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.769" end="00:41:25.349" style="s2">happened and the way people are</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.819" end="00:41:25.349" style="s2">experiencing they&#39;re caught their world</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.859" end="00:41:29.500" style="s2">human beings are still doing everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.089" end="00:41:31.510" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about they still have</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.500" end="00:41:34.769" style="s2">rituals of course they&#39;ve developed them</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.510" end="00:41:37.000" style="s2">into very sophisticated complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.769" end="00:41:42.430" style="s2">they&#39;re still engaging in altered states</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.000" end="00:41:47.289" style="s2">of consciousness and that world is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.430" end="00:41:52.839" style="s2">pervasive for a very long time but our</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.289" end="00:41:54.519" style="s2">connection to it is very odd so if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.839" end="00:41:56.619" style="s2">were to ask you if you&#39;ve read anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.519" end="00:41:58.299" style="s2">from the Bronze Age chances are you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.619" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">haven&#39;t have you read the epic of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.299" end="00:42:05.319" style="s2">gilgamesh well no probably not</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.930" style="s2">right have you read any Egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.319" end="00:42:11.400" style="s2">mythology</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.930" end="00:42:13.750" style="s2">probably not why the Sumerian</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.400" end="00:42:16.920" style="s2">Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.750" end="00:42:20.109" style="s2">are titanically important long lasting</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.920" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">but notice if I ask you if you&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.109" end="00:42:29.859" style="s2">parts of the Bible or perhaps Plato or</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:32.650" style="s2">perhaps some of the Buddha or Confucius</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.859" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">chances aren&#39;t you you have read some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.650" end="00:42:38.589" style="s2">them you somehow feel that those people</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:44.619" style="s2">are relevant to you in a way that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.589" end="00:42:49.589" style="s2">from the Bronze Age aren&#39;t now why there</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.619" end="00:42:55.299" style="s2">seems to have been another great change</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.589" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">comparable to the change of the Upper</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.299" end="00:43:04.539" style="s2">Paleolithic transition again whether</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:07.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a one-shot or more continuum again</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.539" end="00:43:08.799" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m I don&#39;t need to decide that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.000" end="00:43:10.710" style="s2">I&#39;m not confident that that debates</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.799" end="00:43:14.349" style="s2">around that are actually very fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.710" end="00:43:18.130" style="s2">the Karl Jasper&#39;s talked about the axial</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.349" end="00:43:21.480" style="s2">age Karen Armstrong has made famous that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.130" end="00:43:21.480" style="s2">in a recent book</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.539" end="00:43:27.890" style="s2">so around 800 BCE</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.160" end="00:43:41.160" style="s2">around 300 BC there&#39;s this great change</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.210" end="00:43:45.990" style="s2">such that you will read connect to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.160" end="00:43:49.309" style="s2">relevant authors systems of thought ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.990" end="00:43:53.700" style="s2">of being from that time period and yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.309" end="00:43:57.270" style="s2">back here where the Bronze Age ends you</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.700" end="00:43:59.039" style="s2">don&#39;t read this stuff or at least most</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.270" end="00:44:02.849" style="s2">of you don&#39;t you don&#39;t find it relevant</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.849" end="00:44:07.740" style="s2">happened here that is formative of us</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.670" end="00:44:11.220" style="s2">just like the Upper Paleolithic</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.740" end="00:44:14.910" style="s2">transition was formative of us as human</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.220" end="00:44:18.930" style="s2">beings the axial age is formative of us</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.910" end="00:44:21.329" style="s2">as Western civilization or at least</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.930" end="00:44:22.859" style="s2">world civilization because it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.329" end="00:44:26.930" style="s2">in the West that the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.859" end="00:44:26.930" style="s2">occurs it also occurs in India and China</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.539" end="00:44:39.000" style="s2">now what happened why this change well</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.609" end="00:44:41.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of stuff that happens we</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.000" end="00:44:44.250" style="s2">don&#39;t quite know there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.250" end="00:44:47.630" style="s2">Bronze Age collapses</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.430" end="00:44:59.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some good books by this book by</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.170" end="00:45:17.370" style="s2">a combination of change in military</p>

<p begin="00:46:15.560" end="00:46:21.990" style="s2">you have these like the Egyptian Empire</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.450" end="00:46:26.340" style="s2">these Titanic dinosaur empires huge and</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.990" end="00:46:27.840" style="s2">powerful lasting for centuries cultures</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.340" end="00:46:31.970" style="s2">that last millennia and then they</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.840" end="00:46:34.890" style="s2">disappear and what you would find in</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.970" end="00:46:36.120" style="s2">right is something like when the</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.050" end="00:46:43.290" style="s2">about you know they start to evolve what</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.600" end="00:46:45.600" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.290" end="00:46:47.490" style="s2">once these dinosaur empires pass out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.600" end="00:46:49.500" style="s2">existence in the Dark Age is you have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.490" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">lot of little small-scale societies</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.500" end="00:46:57.750" style="s2">people barely hanging on it&#39;s a very</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.750" end="00:47:05.329" style="s2">a demand made on cognition to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.490" end="00:47:07.010" style="s2">remember the bottleneck in Africa</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.910" end="00:47:29.630" style="s2">have before the faster willing to try</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.410" end="00:47:32.359" style="s2">new forms of social organization but</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.630" end="00:47:36.650" style="s2">importantly they start to invent new</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.359" end="00:47:39.980" style="s2">things and they start to invent new</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.650" end="00:47:41.030" style="s2">psycho technologies remember the last</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.980" end="00:47:43.550" style="s2">time we talked about what a psycho</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.670" end="00:48:02.690" style="s2">happens here in one of the areas that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.349" end="00:48:06.680" style="s2">was hit hardest by the Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.690" end="00:48:08.809" style="s2">collapse the area Palestine Palestine</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.680" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">and what&#39;s modern Israel and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.809" end="00:48:17.480" style="s2">places like that used to be the old</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.480" end="00:48:23.150" style="s2">seems to be invented here is a new kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.299" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">of literacy I know we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.150" end="00:48:29.260" style="s2">literacy is a powerful psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:31.910" style="s2">now the Bronze Age world had literacy</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.260" end="00:48:35.420" style="s2">the Egyptians had hieroglyphics famously</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.910" end="00:48:37.430" style="s2">the Sumerians had cuneiform now the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.420" end="00:48:39.559" style="s2">thing about those forms of literacy is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.430" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">they&#39;re very difficult to learn you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.559" end="00:48:45.859" style="s2">to go to school for a very very long</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:47.420" style="s2">time and your job you&#39;re just you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.859" end="00:48:49.880" style="s2">your job you can have this job in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.420" end="00:48:53.059" style="s2">ancient world this was your job to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.880" end="00:48:56.020" style="s2">literate it&#39;s called being a scribe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.059" end="00:48:59.450" style="s2">where we get words like scribble from</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.020" end="00:49:00.920" style="s2">all you were your entire job was you</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.450" end="00:49:02.630" style="s2">were literate because it was a tough</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.920" end="00:49:05.500" style="s2">thing to be literate and it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.630" end="00:49:09.470" style="s2">valuable thing and it was a rare thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.500" end="00:49:11.329" style="s2">because the literacy was hard when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.470" end="00:49:13.080" style="s2">edia graphic so I have some ideograms</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.329" end="00:49:21.420" style="s2">tattooed here</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.080" end="00:49:23.460" style="s2">right this means meditate right what</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.420" end="00:49:25.730" style="s2">gets invented here is alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:25.730" style="s2">literacy</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.200" end="00:49:34.190" style="s2">sort of it seems to be invented in</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.599" end="00:49:35.749" style="s2">Canaan and then it&#39;s taken up by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.190" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">Phoenicians and then they take it to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.749" end="00:49:42.920" style="s2">Greeks and then the the proto that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:45.710" style="s2">Canaanite alphabet merges imperceptibly</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.920" end="00:49:49.339" style="s2">into archaic Hebrew and then gets taken</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.710" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">into Hebrew that&#39;s gonna be important</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.339" end="00:49:52.119" style="s2">these two groups of people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:55.730" style="s2">be very important</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.119" end="00:50:03.349" style="s2">now why is alphabetic literacy so</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.730" end="00:50:05.450" style="s2">powerful it&#39;s much more learn about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.349" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">a more effective and efficient psycho</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.450" end="00:50:11.450" style="s2">technology remember what I said last</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:15.890" style="s2">time how much literacy enhances your</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.450" end="00:50:19.430" style="s2">cognition if I give you alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.890" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">literacy you can learn it much more</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.430" end="00:50:25.339" style="s2">powerfully and more people can learn it</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:26.930" style="s2">so your ability to learn and access and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.339" end="00:50:34.390" style="s2">share with others the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.930" end="00:50:37.279" style="s2">literacy gets magnified tremendously and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.390" end="00:50:38.450" style="s2">what literate so the amount of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.279" end="00:50:44.150" style="s2">the number of people that can be</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.450" end="00:50:47.329" style="s2">literate expands now literacy does</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.150" end="00:50:51.109" style="s2">something very very important really</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.329" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">really interesting in its effect on your</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.109" end="00:50:56.660" style="s2">sense of self and your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:58.730" style="s2">cognition as I noted before when I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.660" end="00:51:00.589" style="s2">write things down I can come back to my</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.730" end="00:51:04.460" style="s2">thoughts later and I can reflect on them</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.589" end="00:51:06.859" style="s2">I start to become more aware of my own</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.460" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">thoughts and notice something else I can</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.859" end="00:51:12.289" style="s2">do I can correct my thinking more</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">readily because I I don&#39;t have to rely</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.289" end="00:51:16.519" style="s2">on it being held in my mind I can put it</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:19.190" style="s2">I can externalize it I can put it out</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.519" end="00:51:22.519" style="s2">there I can reflect on it I can correct</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.190" end="00:51:29.239" style="s2">it I can store it independent of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.519" end="00:51:32.329" style="s2">memory so I start to get a capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.239" end="00:51:34.930" style="s2">what Robert Bellah calls second-order</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.329" end="00:51:34.930" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.350" end="00:51:47.890" style="s2">now we all have metacognition we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.110" end="00:51:49.930" style="s2">about this later</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.890" end="00:51:51.700" style="s2">metacognition is your awareness of your</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.930" end="00:51:52.360" style="s2">own mind I can ask you right now what</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.700" end="00:51:55.600" style="s2">are you thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.360" end="00:51:57.610" style="s2">you can company become aware of it do</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.600" end="00:51:58.630" style="s2">you have a good memory yes or no you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.610" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">say I do or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.630" end="00:52:01.990" style="s2">that&#39;s metacognition it&#39;s your knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:04.420" style="s2">and awareness of your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.990" end="00:52:06.090" style="s2">we all have metacognition but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.420" end="00:52:08.410" style="s2">things you can do with literacy</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.090" end="00:52:10.750" style="s2">alphabetic literacy is you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.410" end="00:52:15.820" style="s2">internalize literacy into your</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.750" end="00:52:19.930" style="s2">metacognition so notice I&#39;m becoming</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.820" end="00:52:21.910" style="s2">aware of my own cognition here I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.930" end="00:52:25.480" style="s2">reflect on it I can correct it I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.910" end="00:52:29.350" style="s2">enhance it I can store it I can share it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.480" end="00:52:31.690" style="s2">with others second order thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.350" end="00:52:34.660" style="s2">when you internalize a psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.690" end="00:52:37.450" style="s2">into your metacognition and it improves</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.660" end="00:52:40.570" style="s2">your capacity to critically examine your</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.450" end="00:52:46.030" style="s2">own thinking and correct your own</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.570" end="00:52:48.190" style="s2">thinking second order thinking starts to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.030" end="00:52:51.450" style="s2">emerge because of alphabetic literacy</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.190" end="00:52:56.110" style="s2">what else is being invented at this time</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.450" end="00:52:58.570" style="s2">well you&#39;ve got lots of armies moving</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.110" end="00:53:00.670" style="s2">around in this period because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.570" end="00:53:03.370" style="s2">happening is empires are being rebuilt</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.670" end="00:53:05.850" style="s2">famously the Assyrian Empire in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.370" end="00:53:09.840" style="s2">Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.850" end="00:53:09.840" style="s2">mobile armies are needed</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.200" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an invention here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:19.650" style="s2">really important that we also take for</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:21.510" style="s2">granted right it&#39;s the stuff we carry</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.650" end="00:53:22.529" style="s2">around well we used to carry it around</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.510" end="00:53:24.210" style="s2">we don&#39;t carry it around anymore we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.529" end="00:53:30.059" style="s2">talk about that it&#39;s money</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.210" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">coinage coinage is invented now quite as</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.059" end="00:53:33.390" style="s2">pointage is obviously a physical</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:35.190" style="s2">technology in one sense like carry coins</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.390" end="00:53:36.990" style="s2">around although the sense in which money</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.190" end="00:53:38.910" style="s2">is now physical is very very tenuous</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.990" end="00:53:40.710" style="s2">because most of us don&#39;t carry anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.910" end="00:53:43.010" style="s2">physical anymore money is disappear Li</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.710" end="00:53:46.440" style="s2">symbolic thing and that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.010" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">money Treacher&#39;s you to think in an</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.440" end="00:53:54.029" style="s2">abstract symbol system you starts</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:56.059" style="s2">thinking in abstract symbol systems and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.029" end="00:53:58.140" style="s2">it also teaches you something else</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.059" end="00:54:00.779" style="s2">numeracy you have to start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.140" end="00:54:04.099" style="s2">mathematically at least Aerith matically</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.779" end="00:54:06.650" style="s2">so you now have abstract symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.099" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">logically rigorous thought being trained</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:13.710" style="s2">purposes but it&#39;s being trained it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.289" end="00:54:17.039" style="s2">ready for exaptation the alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.710" end="00:54:22.980" style="s2">literacy is training this second order</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.039" end="00:54:25.230" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s ready for exaptation you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.980" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">say okay I get it</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.230" end="00:54:28.200" style="s2">the cycle technologies are training</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:30.329" style="s2">skills that are ready for exaptation</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.200" end="00:54:34.700" style="s2">well bring that second order thinking</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.329" end="00:54:37.650" style="s2">and bring that abstract symbolic thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.700" end="00:54:39.259" style="s2">more logically rigorous together and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.650" end="00:54:41.539" style="s2">what are you going to start getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.259" end="00:54:47.190" style="s2">you&#39;re going to start getting people</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.539" end="00:54:52.349" style="s2">having a very bright clear sense of two</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.190" end="00:54:57.660" style="s2">things about their cognition one thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.349" end="00:55:00.150" style="s2">is how much they can correct their</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.660" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">cognition how much they can transcend</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.150" end="00:55:03.509" style="s2">themselves self transcendence it</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:09.769" style="s2">enhances their sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.509" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">transcendence but what&#39;s it also doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.769" end="00:55:16.130" style="s2">it&#39;s also enhancing their awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:16.130" style="s2">how self-deceptive they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.810" end="00:55:23.750" style="s2">how much error is in their cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.250" end="00:55:26.210" style="s2">they previously couldn&#39;t be aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.750" end="00:55:28.670" style="s2">but now with second-order thinking with</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.210" end="00:55:30.020" style="s2">literacy an abstract symbolic thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.670" end="00:55:32.990" style="s2">and numeracy they can become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.020" end="00:55:35.150" style="s2">this now you put those two together a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.990" end="00:55:39.130" style="s2">tremendous capacity for self correction</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.150" end="00:55:41.750" style="s2">a tremendous capacity for self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.130" end="00:55:43.369" style="s2">and human being start to do something</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.750" end="00:55:44.990" style="s2">very differently they start to change</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.369" end="00:55:51.770" style="s2">their sense of self and their sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.990" end="00:55:56.030" style="s2">the world they start to realize a more</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.770" end="00:55:57.619" style="s2">personal sense of responsibility which</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.030" end="00:56:01.940" style="s2">of course is gonna change how people</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.619" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">think morally about themselves what I</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.940" end="00:56:07.730" style="s2">mean let me give you a specific example</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:10.520" style="s2">if you look before this time right</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.730" end="00:56:12.020" style="s2">people think of chaos and warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.520" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">violence as just part of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.020" end="00:56:20.470" style="s2">order but after the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:23.109" style="s2">with the advent of second order thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.470" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">with this increased awareness of self</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.109" end="00:56:27.710" style="s2">transcendence and self correction people</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:30.170" style="s2">start to realize no no no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.710" end="00:56:32.180" style="s2">responsible for the violence we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.170" end="00:56:34.550" style="s2">responsible for the chaos not just in</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.180" end="00:56:38.329" style="s2">some vague sense but it&#39;s the way my</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.550" end="00:56:40.339" style="s2">mind makes meaning that&#39;s why the damn a</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.329" end="00:56:47.230" style="s2">powder begins the mind is the chief</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.339" end="00:56:49.430" style="s2">thing people understand they understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.230" end="00:56:51.560" style="s2">and you see this in the Dhammapada</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.430" end="00:56:53.810" style="s2">there is no enemy greater than your own</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.560" end="00:56:56.380" style="s2">mind but there is no ally greater than</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.810" end="00:56:58.670" style="s2">your own mind people start understanding</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.380" end="00:57:03.589" style="s2">this double-edged sword of their own</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.670" end="00:57:06.109" style="s2">cognition undisciplined leads to</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.589" end="00:57:09.230" style="s2">violence through self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.109" end="00:57:10.700" style="s2">illusion but discipline through self</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.230" end="00:57:13.730" style="s2">correction and self transcendence leads</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.700" end="00:57:18.800" style="s2">to wisdom and the ability to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.730" end="00:57:20.750" style="s2">violence and the suffering so in our</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.800" end="00:57:22.280" style="s2">next meeting together we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.750" end="00:57:26.119" style="s2">talk more about this actual revolution</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.280" end="00:57:28.339" style="s2">and this sense that people had of their</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.119" end="00:57:30.319" style="s2">capacity for self transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.339" end="00:57:32.599" style="s2">their capacity for self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.319" end="00:57:34.549" style="s2">and how that changed radically their</p>
