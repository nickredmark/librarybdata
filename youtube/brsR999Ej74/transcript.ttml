<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:06.359" style="s2">so one that was awesome that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.370" end="00:00:09.300" style="s2">fantastic and wildly beautiful and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.359" end="00:00:11.460" style="s2">important I mean so important you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">and you know this is the place and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.460" end="00:00:16.199" style="s2">gonna be dialoguing more in this both on</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:17.430" style="s2">the the second person topic from I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.199" end="00:00:21.150" style="s2">that was week</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">five right and and on this this paradox</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.150" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">topic which is one of our core grounds</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">so so let me start just with a funny</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">place you know which is laughter right</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:37.050" style="s2">in the kind of classical deepest</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:40.230" style="s2">understanding possible is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.050" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">faculty of perception so the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">Hebrew mystical text we have is called</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">the book of creation and it&#39;s about 470</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.850" end="00:00:51.930" style="s2">words and it lists 12 faculties of sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:53.570" style="s2">perception and the twelfth Faculty right</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.930" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">the highest one the twelfth is laughter</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.570" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">so what does it mean it laughter a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:00:59.100" style="s2">Faculty of sense perception it means it</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">allows us to understand a dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.100" end="00:01:02.699" style="s2">reality that nothing else allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">understand just like taste gives me</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.699" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">something that touch doesn&#39;t give me</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">that hearing that seem so what is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">that laughter allows you to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:14.100" style="s2">all right laughter allows me both to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">nullify right the apparent paradox</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.100" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">all right I&#39;ll nullify the the false</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">dichotomy right and left allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">hold paradox it&#39;s left eleven will hold</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">that paradox so laughter is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">critical Faculty of sense perception</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">when we stop laughing it&#39;s not just if</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">we take ourselves too seriously but we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">actually get lost in one half of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">paradox which is always the source of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">evil right evil always emerges from an</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">unhealthy era Docs where we absolute</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">eyes right one side right and in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">sense that the modern expression of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">is what we call today extremism all</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">right you know extremists feel better</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">when they wake up in the morning right</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:53.790" style="s2">you&#39;re right because because extremists</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:55.470" style="s2">don&#39;t have to hold paradox so you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.790" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">you just you take one side of an issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.470" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">let&#39;s give one example then to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">Barbara but just to make this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">just really just alive for people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">most obvious way</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:05.750" style="s2">so take abortion right so what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">position are you pro-life or pro-choice</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.750" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">but but who&#39;s who listen was against</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:14.130" style="s2">life who&#39;s against choice but each side</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:17.190" style="s2">absolute size is once</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.130" end="00:02:18.960" style="s2">refuses to old paradox and and then D</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:20.790" style="s2">contextualizes their value from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.960" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">larger constellation of values and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.790" end="00:02:24.660" style="s2">becomes an idolatry right at the altar</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">of that particular value in a non</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">paradoxical way which all produces some</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">version of evil so holding paradox and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:36.870" style="s2">and in the ultimate in the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">sense right you know is the the key to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.870" end="00:02:42.090" style="s2">evolution actually it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">mechanism of evolution itself is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.090" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">believe it&#39;ll hold paradox in its</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">ontological form which is so that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:52.530" style="s2">such a perfect way to end right this</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">series I&#39;m just gorgeous you see I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.530" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">to just say how it makes it easier to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:01.890" style="s2">this is it&#39;s a simple phrase the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">overview perspective when there&#39;s a book</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.890" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">that was written by Frank white about</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">the astronauts and what happened when</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.730" style="s2">they saw Earth from space as a whole and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">they gave us the picture of ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.730" end="00:03:16.290" style="s2">a whole system now think of all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">paradoxes on earth think of all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.290" end="00:03:20.670" style="s2">conflict think of all the separation</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:23.880" style="s2">think of the animals hunting each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.670" end="00:03:27.540" style="s2">but from that perspective it was whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.880" end="00:03:31.110" style="s2">and I&#39;m just wondering about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.540" end="00:03:33.600" style="s2">paradox requiring an overview</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.110" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">perspective where you see it as whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.600" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">because as you were talking Daniel I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">realizing innately you have an overview</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">perspective you can&#39;t see this part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">the house of that part of the house but</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:46.890" style="s2">when you&#39;re seeing the whole you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:49.980" style="s2">be outside the whole to some degree to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.890" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">see it and context is always standing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.980" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">slightly outside so I just wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:58.769" style="s2">to what degree to standing outside even</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:04:01.350" style="s2">like choice or pro-life if you stand</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.769" end="00:04:03.780" style="s2">outside of it you see really both parts</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.350" end="00:04:06.209" style="s2">of it you see the good in both parts and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.780" end="00:04:10.590" style="s2">you but you&#39;re not caught up in either</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.209" end="00:04:12.660" style="s2">of them oh so overview holes to get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.590" end="00:04:15.239" style="s2">whole system I believe you have to spend</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.660" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">outside of it and another phrase for</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.239" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">that is extatic</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:24.030" style="s2">mmm isn&#39;t very nice that the word</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">ecstasy should be ecstatic that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.030" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">standing outside its extent</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:31.199" style="s2">think of joy and I was just looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">that trying to understand it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.199" end="00:04:38.430" style="s2">relationship to what you are saying is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:39.930" style="s2">oh so let&#39;s play with that if I take an</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.430" end="00:04:41.879" style="s2">overview perspective from that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.930" end="00:04:44.340" style="s2">perspective of the house so I take an</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.879" end="00:04:46.590" style="s2">aerial photographic I definitely get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.340" end="00:04:49.289" style="s2">sense of the big picture of the house</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.590" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">right I can see that it has a north side</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.289" end="00:04:53.969" style="s2">and the south side nice I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:56.009" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t give me the pictures that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.969" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">being on the ground looking at it or</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.009" end="00:04:58.650" style="s2">inside of it wood it doesn&#39;t replace</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:04:59.969" style="s2">those I actually have no idea what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.650" end="00:05:01.500" style="s2">inside of the house looks like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.969" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">even have a clear perspective on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.500" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">front door there so I have a high-level</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.610" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s important and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:09.990" style="s2">meaningful and all of the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.610" end="00:05:11.669" style="s2">perspectives are also important and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.990" end="00:05:13.110" style="s2">meaningful and none of those give me the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.669" end="00:05:15.050" style="s2">perspective that zooming in with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.110" end="00:05:17.219" style="s2">microscope and actually looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.050" end="00:05:18.449" style="s2">you know molecular structure of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.219" end="00:05:20.719" style="s2">something in the wall there which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.449" end="00:05:23.219" style="s2">part of the truth that it would and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.719" end="00:05:26.279" style="s2">the overview that gives you all of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.219" end="00:05:28.050" style="s2">can&#39;t happen in a single snapshot right</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.279" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">there is no snapshot there&#39;s no picture</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.050" end="00:05:33.810" style="s2">that you can do but there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:35.699" style="s2">there&#39;s a I actually like the term that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.810" end="00:05:38.520" style="s2">Ken Wilber uses integral methodological</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.699" end="00:05:39.930" style="s2">pluralism is mouthful but pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.520" end="00:05:42.569" style="s2">means there&#39;s all these pictures right</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.930" end="00:05:44.909" style="s2">but there is a method to how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.569" end="00:05:46.919" style="s2">integrate them that actually makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.909" end="00:05:49.169" style="s2">right which is how do you tie those</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.919" end="00:05:50.819" style="s2">pictures together and so the overview</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.169" end="00:05:52.259" style="s2">perspective like if I look at Earth from</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.819" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">the astronaut point of view it gives me</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.259" end="00:05:56.219" style="s2">a perspective that no point of view on</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:57.900" style="s2">earth could give there&#39;s no point like</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.219" end="00:06:00.210" style="s2">being on earth you can&#39;t get wow this</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.900" end="00:06:02.370" style="s2">pale blue dot and yet the pale blue dot</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.210" end="00:06:04.349" style="s2">perspective also doesn&#39;t replace getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.370" end="00:06:08.370" style="s2">to look face to face with you right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.349" end="00:06:10.680" style="s2">so so I see integrating being actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.370" end="00:06:12.509" style="s2">trans perspective oh it&#39;s not any</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.680" end="00:06:14.849" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s the ability to put the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.509" end="00:06:17.460" style="s2">perspectives together which is a purely</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.849" end="00:06:20.610" style="s2">abstract function not a five sensory</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.460" end="00:06:22.439" style="s2">function and that&#39;s that&#39;s fantastic I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.610" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">teaching two things just immersing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.439" end="00:06:28.169" style="s2">one barber then back to Daniel ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:30.839" style="s2">right ecstatic so we talked earlier</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.169" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">about how the unique self allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.839" end="00:06:35.639" style="s2">transcend the paradox between autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:36.810" style="s2">and communion but when you&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.639" end="00:06:38.550" style="s2">you&#39;re in unique self you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.810" end="00:06:39.569" style="s2">fullness of your aliveness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.550" end="00:06:41.789" style="s2">actually what ecstasy does</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.569" end="00:06:43.789" style="s2">yeah when you&#39;re ecstatic actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.789" end="00:06:45.899" style="s2">autonomy in communion again disappear</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.789" end="00:06:48.119" style="s2">right that&#39;s it yeah I can see it</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.899" end="00:06:50.610" style="s2">happening yeah right in ecstasy itself</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.119" end="00:06:52.830" style="s2">right you&#39;re totally open and fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.610" end="00:06:54.869" style="s2">yourself right and of course that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.830" end="00:06:57.809" style="s2">nature of sexuality in its ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.869" end="00:06:59.939" style="s2">place sexuality holds paradox it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.809" end="00:07:02.069" style="s2">that&#39;s why sexuality represents a higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.939" end="00:07:03.869" style="s2">order of being it&#39;s why it teaches</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.069" end="00:07:06.119" style="s2">arrows because in its very nature it</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.869" end="00:07:07.529" style="s2">holds this higher order of being and of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.119" end="00:07:10.139" style="s2">course integral methodological pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.529" end="00:07:12.119" style="s2">of course the key is development right</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.139" end="00:07:14.099" style="s2">now you&#39;re seeing the entire you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.119" end="00:07:15.809" style="s2">seeing the entire up and down you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.099" end="00:07:17.099" style="s2">second year of consciousness so you see</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.809" end="00:07:18.899" style="s2">all the levels of consciousness yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.099" end="00:07:20.999" style="s2">you&#39;re not in any of them and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.899" end="00:07:23.729" style="s2">therefore all of the different methods</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.999" end="00:07:25.050" style="s2">are plurally appropriate because they</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.729" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">all naturally fall in the right place</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.050" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">and they don&#39;t conflict with each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.180" style="s2">even though they do because they&#39;re held</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">in a larger piece okay but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.180" end="00:07:34.469" style="s2">make this really kind of bring totally</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:36.119" style="s2">down to earth so let&#39;s take just because</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.469" end="00:07:38.339" style="s2">you&#39;re up here with me and we&#39;re hanging</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.930" end="00:09:23.790" style="s2">but if they&#39;re a true romantic couple at</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.060" end="00:09:25.769" style="s2">some point they drop in to a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.790" end="00:09:27.750" style="s2">level of consciousness and said Sidney</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.769" end="00:09:30.120" style="s2">and Barbara did you choose each other</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.370" end="00:09:36.149" style="s2">of course Krishnamurti choicelessness</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.800" end="00:09:37.860" style="s2">right so it&#39;s just a place where we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.149" end="00:09:40.350" style="s2">all find in our lives a place just to</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.860" end="00:09:42.690" style="s2">access it directly and a real kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.350" end="00:09:45.000" style="s2">direct experience where we&#39;re choosing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.690" end="00:09:47.940" style="s2">but we&#39;re not choosing and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.000" end="00:09:50.519" style="s2">radically true right and yet there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.940" end="00:09:51.569" style="s2">higher subtlety in which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.519" end="00:09:53.940" style="s2">something which is called choicelessness</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.569" end="00:09:55.649" style="s2">which is beyond and accessing those</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.940" end="00:09:58.410" style="s2">truths are part of the source code</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.649" end="00:10:01.139" style="s2">change that we need and everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.410" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">changes particularism and universalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.139" end="00:10:06.180" style="s2">effort not effort I mean I just listed</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:08.220" style="s2">just for fun right I listed about 27 of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.180" end="00:10:10.230" style="s2">them here but I just is why administers</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.220" end="00:10:10.829" style="s2">but there&#39;s the whole this is a source</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.230" end="00:10:13.350" style="s2">go change</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.829" end="00:10:16.019" style="s2">it&#39;s so exciting but you know when I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.350" end="00:10:18.569" style="s2">attracted to Daniel in the lobby it</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.019" end="00:10:21.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that like chose to be attracted I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.569" end="00:10:22.829" style="s2">simply was attracted because of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.720" end="00:10:25.800" style="s2">nature of what he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.829" end="00:10:27.990" style="s2">choicelessness it&#39;s choiceless but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.800" end="00:10:31.829" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t use the word please Joyce less</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.990" end="00:10:33.240" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t related to choice you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.829" end="00:10:38.130" style="s2">know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the choice or</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.240" end="00:10:43.970" style="s2">choice less it was attraction that was I</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.130" end="00:10:47.880" style="s2">would say he&#39;s simply based on mutual</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.970" end="00:10:53.250" style="s2">relationship that I didn&#39;t choose or not</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.880" end="00:10:54.259" style="s2">choose just was it just was right you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.250" end="00:10:59.490" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.259" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">mark the topic of reconciling volition</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.490" end="00:11:04.260" style="s2">and determinism right and is all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:05.939" style="s2">questions that go with it is universe</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.260" end="00:11:08.369" style="s2">fundamentally deterministic is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.939" end="00:11:10.529" style="s2">they&#39;re some fundamental in determinism</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.369" end="00:11:12.539" style="s2">right there is does that relate to human</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.529" end="00:11:14.069" style="s2">free will or not right I come from</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.539" end="00:11:15.989" style="s2">quantum mechanics does it come from</p>

<p begin="00:11:18.239" end="00:11:23.369" style="s2">some of the deepest X&#39;s - the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.629" end="00:11:26.999" style="s2">philosophy and ontology and what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.369" end="00:11:28.889" style="s2">interesting about it because these were</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.999" end="00:11:31.079" style="s2">the questions that I drove myself most</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.889" end="00:11:33.479" style="s2">insane over for much of my life and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.079" end="00:11:36.269" style="s2">think most people that get real deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.479" end="00:11:38.939" style="s2">into it do and if you read the great</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.269" end="00:11:41.639" style="s2">debates recently between Sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.939" end="00:11:44.099" style="s2">Dan Dennett on the topic you know Sam</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.639" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">says there&#39;s no such thing as free will</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.099" end="00:11:47.819" style="s2">but there is consciousness and Dan</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:49.199" style="s2">Dennett says well there&#39;s no such thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.819" end="00:11:50.939" style="s2">as consciousness but there is freewill</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.199" end="00:11:53.129" style="s2">and you know real interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.939" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">ways and and all of the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.129" end="00:12:00.059" style="s2">philosophers disagree for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:12:04.349" style="s2">and their perspectives are true right</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.059" end="00:12:05.339" style="s2">and how those ones reconcile so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.349" end="00:12:07.889" style="s2">like where is the false dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.339" end="00:12:09.869" style="s2">where&#39;s the where&#39;s the 2d instead of 3d</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.889" end="00:12:12.149" style="s2">kind of respective and it does come down</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.869" end="00:12:13.679" style="s2">to agency and it comes to well who is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.149" end="00:12:15.959" style="s2">the self that is choosing versus the</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.209" end="00:12:24.569" style="s2">has a volition and the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.859" end="00:12:25.919" style="s2">rest of the universe exterior and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.569" end="00:12:28.319" style="s2">the whole ons interior that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.919" end="00:12:29.749" style="s2">contributing to that separation ends up</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.319" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">being a big part of the false dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.749" end="00:12:36.449" style="s2">where yes this there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:38.489" style="s2">mechanics external and internal to how</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.449" end="00:12:40.470" style="s2">this thing occurs and this thing is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.489" end="00:12:41.759" style="s2">emergent property that is different than</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.470" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">the sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.759" end="00:12:49.259" style="s2">and so yes there is volition and that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:50.849" style="s2">deep everything that happens has</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.259" end="00:12:52.259" style="s2">deterministic elements that are part of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.849" end="00:12:54.029" style="s2">it right right yeah that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.259" end="00:12:56.669" style="s2">I mean emergence understood that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.029" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">exactly an emergence changes everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.669" end="00:13:01.019" style="s2">because because emergence when we really</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:03.119" style="s2">get emergence then that whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.019" end="00:13:04.559" style="s2">conversation changes without emergence</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.119" end="00:13:06.569" style="s2">as ad Adam it&#39;s a different conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.559" end="00:13:07.289" style="s2">we promise by doing the written notes of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.569" end="00:13:10.379" style="s2">this we&#39;re gonna make this a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.289" end="00:13:14.369" style="s2">clearer I think we just long pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.379" end="00:13:16.109" style="s2">everybody for anyone who is interested</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.369" end="00:13:16.329" style="s2">and obviously there&#39;s a whole rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.109" end="00:13:17.529" style="s2">hole</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.329" end="00:13:21.489" style="s2">here that we&#39;re gonna be having big</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.529" end="00:13:23.619" style="s2">conversations on this skimming but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.489" end="00:13:24.939" style="s2">Kaufman&#39;s works specifically Stewart</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.619" end="00:13:26.889" style="s2">Kaufman&#39;s work and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.939" end="00:13:30.069" style="s2">emergence and the fundamental creativity</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.889" end="00:13:33.009" style="s2">of universe and that laws themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.069" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">still emerging and what he calls killing</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.009" end="00:13:37.239" style="s2">the galilean dream that deeply changed</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:38.739" style="s2">the deterministic only model for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.239" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">where I was able to hold that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.739" end="00:13:44.499" style="s2">great no coffins fantastic let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:47.679" style="s2">maybe finish with a wild story about</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.489" end="00:14:24.369" style="s2">the king why is David laughing so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.100" end="00:14:25.509" style="s2">text says because David says to God God</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.540" end="00:14:39.069" style="s2">this right and God says no no you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.970" end="00:14:40.419" style="s2">David I want to do it so David goes up</p>
