    "title": "Session 9: Reconciling Paradox",
    "description": "Marc begins this discussion by saying that laughter is a phenomenon that allows us to nullify false dichotomies and hold paradox. When we stop laughing, we get lost in one half of the paradox and getting lost in one half of the paradox is what Marc calls the source of evil. When we absolutize one side, we call that extremism. Holding paradox is the key to evolution, a central mechanism of evolution, and that is why this is a great topic to conclude this course.\n\nThis conversation continues with a discussion about the overview perspective, and the importance of learning to put all the many perspectives and snapshots of a house, for example, into an integrated perspective that cannot be found in any single snapshot or in a random scattering of different snapshots. How those pieces fit together is essential. The conversation also explores the classical philosophical debate surrounding volition and determinism.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n    Why being able to hold paradox is critical to evolution and to becoming a Future Human\n    What the overview effect is\n    The definition of ecstasy\n    How sexuality holds paradox from a higher order of being\n    What integral methodological pluralism means\n    A story about King David that exemplifies this teaching\n\nLearn more about the course:\nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",
