<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">this week Daniel SH macton Berger who is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">a found at the neuro hacker collective a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:17.820" style="s2">movement dedicated to upgrading our</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">individual and collective capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.820" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">to safeguarding the well-being of all</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:25.679" style="s2">he&#39;s an evolutionary philosopher systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">designer a strategist and I could</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.679" end="00:01:30.319" style="s2">probably keep throwing lots of labels</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:32.990" style="s2">around and that&#39;s still kind of apply</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.319" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of crossover between</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.990" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">different fields which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">something that we&#39;re going to explore in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">this episode so Daniel thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:45.000" style="s2">much for joining us thank you for having</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">me fun to be here how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.000" end="00:01:49.440" style="s2">feel about the labels in fact when</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:54.179" style="s2">trying to sum up the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.440" end="00:01:56.099" style="s2">interested in I like talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.179" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">things that I&#39;m interested in more than</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.099" end="00:02:04.380" style="s2">labels of things that I am or I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">when in general when people are wanting</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.380" end="00:02:08.190" style="s2">to ask what my background is whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">out I like sharing things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.190" end="00:02:11.489" style="s2">passionate about and I like asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">people similarly what they&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.489" end="00:02:18.870" style="s2">in and yeah as you said there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:20.459" style="s2">overlapping interests when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.870" end="00:02:23.569" style="s2">deep fascination with the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.459" end="00:02:26.060" style="s2">reality and everything within it</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.569" end="00:02:28.579" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s good to start with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.060" end="00:02:30.709" style="s2">the things that you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.579" end="00:02:34.250" style="s2">rather than making identity statements</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.709" end="00:02:36.680" style="s2">so what what do you think how would you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.250" end="00:02:39.140" style="s2">sum up the the mission of neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.680" end="00:02:41.239" style="s2">collective and what what drives and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.140" end="00:02:42.980" style="s2">prompted you to do the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.239" end="00:02:48.290" style="s2">do and what the collective is aiming to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.980" end="00:02:50.389" style="s2">do mm-hmm so the collective is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.290" end="00:02:55.639" style="s2">awesome project and it&#39;s one project</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.389" end="00:02:56.840" style="s2">that I&#39;ve associated with and there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.639" end="00:02:58.659" style="s2">other projects I&#39;m associate would they</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.840" end="00:03:01.569" style="s2">do very different things so what its</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.659" end="00:03:05.000" style="s2">mission is and what moves me are</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.569" end="00:03:10.900" style="s2">partially overlapping the goal of neural</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.000" end="00:03:13.489" style="s2">hacker is really at an individual level</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.900" end="00:03:16.430" style="s2">increasing human well-being and human</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.489" end="00:03:18.139" style="s2">capacity and right in that right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.430" end="00:03:20.299" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly focused on the physiology</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.139" end="00:03:25.389" style="s2">side of that but is eventually</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.299" end="00:03:27.500" style="s2">interested in the psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.389" end="00:03:30.229" style="s2">psychological cognitive development side</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.500" end="00:03:33.139" style="s2">as well but specifically looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.229" end="00:03:36.019" style="s2">how physiology effects psyche both</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.139" end="00:03:39.739" style="s2">states of experience emotion you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.019" end="00:03:41.620" style="s2">well-being and capacities and working to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.739" end="00:03:46.849" style="s2">do a better job of how we support</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.620" end="00:03:50.479" style="s2">physiologies to predispose happier and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.849" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">more capable and more positively</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.479" end="00:03:55.190" style="s2">oriented people is really the interest</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.979" style="s2">of it and in terms of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.190" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">so far that&#39;s exploring the space of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.979" end="00:04:01.370" style="s2">what you could think of as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:03.290" style="s2">psycho neuropharmacology or psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.370" end="00:04:05.949" style="s2">but rather than just looking at single</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.290" end="00:04:09.079" style="s2">molecule solutions how do we address</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.949" end="00:04:10.639" style="s2">dopamine through one synthetic molecule</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.079" end="00:04:14.750" style="s2">or address serotonin or one synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.639" end="00:04:17.239" style="s2">molecule trying to look at is is there</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:19.099" style="s2">anything even imbalance with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.239" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">person&#39;s dopaminergic system do we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.099" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">and if so where did the imbalance occur</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">and do we understand about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:29.659" style="s2">regulatory systems that are involved and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:31.729" style="s2">what would a more comprehensive approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.659" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">to supporting those regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.729" end="00:04:35.450" style="s2">to do better and is dopamine the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:36.249" style="s2">thing that was imbalanced if it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.450" end="00:04:38.379" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.249" end="00:04:40.899" style="s2">their other neurotransmitters involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.379" end="00:04:42.789" style="s2">were their other nutrient amounts as</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.899" end="00:04:44.889" style="s2">involved where their gut brain access or</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.789" end="00:04:46.989" style="s2">neuro inflammatory dynamics so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.889" end="00:04:49.869" style="s2">do a better job of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.989" end="00:04:52.239" style="s2">physiology as a whole as a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.869" end="00:04:55.929" style="s2">then not just physiology but the mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.239" end="00:04:57.279" style="s2">brain environment complex but starting</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.929" end="00:04:58.869" style="s2">even just with physiology how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.279" end="00:05:00.459" style="s2">understand how the different systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.869" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">interact with each other more complexly</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.459" end="00:05:06.369" style="s2">how do they self-regulate what leads to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:08.259" style="s2">increased homeostatic resilience or</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.369" end="00:05:09.879" style="s2">decreased homeostatic resilience or</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.259" end="00:05:12.429" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.879" end="00:05:13.959" style="s2">and how can we do a better job of both</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.429" end="00:05:17.879" style="s2">understanding these systems and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.959" end="00:05:20.619" style="s2">supporting these systems to have more</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.879" end="00:05:22.299" style="s2">resilience and more capacity so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.619" end="00:05:25.119" style="s2">the goal of neural hacker and if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.299" end="00:05:26.259" style="s2">know if anyone goes to the website and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.119" end="00:05:31.299" style="s2">checks it out with what they&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.259" end="00:05:33.969" style="s2">right now is some information about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.299" end="00:05:39.639" style="s2">mission writ large but then they&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.969" end="00:05:41.739" style="s2">one offering which is you know we we we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.639" end="00:05:44.439" style="s2">had a first offering that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.739" end="00:05:47.079" style="s2">how do we do something better than the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.439" end="00:05:50.409" style="s2">smart drugs that people are taking to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.079" end="00:05:52.839" style="s2">increase productive capacity but that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.409" end="00:05:55.169" style="s2">increase a fairly narrow bandwidth of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.839" end="00:05:57.849" style="s2">productive capacity oftentimes at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.169" end="00:06:00.219" style="s2">expense of other meaningful aspects so</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.849" end="00:06:01.779" style="s2">maybe we get more focused but certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.219" end="00:06:03.849" style="s2">memory metrics decrease certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.779" end="00:06:06.459" style="s2">creativity metrics decrease and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.849" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">things like empathy decrease anxiety can</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.459" end="00:06:10.539" style="s2">increase and it&#39;s doing it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:13.839" style="s2">creates long term dependence and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.539" end="00:06:15.819" style="s2">down-regulation can we increase a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.839" end="00:06:17.679" style="s2">broader set of the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.819" end="00:06:19.959" style="s2">meaningful for people and do it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.679" end="00:06:23.169" style="s2">where because it&#39;s working through and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.959" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">with their endogenous regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.169" end="00:06:27.459" style="s2">rather than overriding them if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:29.289" style="s2">on something like this for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.459" end="00:06:30.939" style="s2">then get off of it they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.289" end="00:06:33.129" style="s2">dependence and crash and if anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.939" end="00:06:36.399" style="s2">they have lasting elevation of baseline</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.129" end="00:06:37.839" style="s2">those were our goals and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.399" end="00:06:40.299" style="s2">working on that for a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.839" end="00:06:42.069" style="s2">categories not just in the productivity</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.299" end="00:06:44.739" style="s2">category but that that was the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.069" end="00:06:47.180" style="s2">thing that we were able to get far</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.739" end="00:06:50.660" style="s2">enough with to have as an offer</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.180" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">- that&#39;s neural hacker yes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.660" end="00:06:54.290" style="s2">that those are the kind of the areas</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.290" end="00:07:00.620" style="s2">episode with the personal development</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.260" end="00:07:03.880" style="s2">but I think if we look at the the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.620" end="00:07:06.950" style="s2">picture of societies and where we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.880" end="00:07:08.690" style="s2">across the world it&#39;s almost the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.950" end="00:07:11.150" style="s2">problem but talking at the collective</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.690" end="00:07:14.840" style="s2">level about how we can optimize what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.150" end="00:07:16.520" style="s2">have and try and raise and change some</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.840" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">baselines away from if there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.520" end="00:07:23.780" style="s2">depleted or dangerous levels do you see</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:26.350" style="s2">them as sort of overlapping goals in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.780" end="00:07:28.850" style="s2">that respect the the collective</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.350" end="00:07:33.200" style="s2">optimization or is it a different sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.850" end="00:07:36.830" style="s2">of perspective the human brain the human</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.200" end="00:07:40.250" style="s2">physiology the human psyche and culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.830" end="00:07:43.730" style="s2">and ecology are all complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.250" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">right self-organizing complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.730" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">and we are not that good at interacting</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:53.630" style="s2">with and supporting complex systems yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">we the whole field of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.630" end="00:07:59.020" style="s2">is still a brand new field and hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:08:02.330" style="s2">really entered that meaningfully into</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.020" end="00:08:04.910" style="s2">how we approach things like design we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.330" end="00:08:06.670" style="s2">quite good at simple systems and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.910" end="00:08:10.730" style="s2">also pretty good at complicated systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.670" end="00:08:13.210" style="s2">so when I look at something like the LAT</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.730" end="00:08:16.550" style="s2">laptop I&#39;m talking to you on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.210" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">blueprint for how to make it from you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.550" end="00:08:20.210" style="s2">know the transistor level all the way up</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:21.920" style="s2">to all the parts hitting together</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.210" end="00:08:24.740" style="s2">software I mean there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.920" end="00:08:26.210" style="s2">amount of information no one person</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.740" end="00:08:28.600" style="s2">could do it it takes a tremendous number</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.210" end="00:08:31.580" style="s2">of people but there is a blueprint and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.600" end="00:08:34.430" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t evolve itself in real time</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.580" end="00:08:36.500" style="s2">right so it&#39;s a static design it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.430" end="00:08:39.650" style="s2">designed the computer didn&#39;t design</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.500" end="00:08:41.540" style="s2">itself it&#39;s designed from outside of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.650" end="00:08:44.780" style="s2">itself it doesn&#39;t repair itself as</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.540" end="00:08:48.500" style="s2">opposed to when we look at biology and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.780" end="00:08:50.870" style="s2">we see systems that organize and emerge</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.500" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">in relationship with their environments</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.870" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">but without exogenous design and where</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:57.710" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a formal blueprint the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.180" style="s2">blueprint itself is changing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.710" end="00:09:00.079" style="s2">structure of it is changing in every</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.180" end="00:09:01.459" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.079" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">even if we look at the genome the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.459" end="00:09:09.350" style="s2">genetic expression is changing and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:10.999" style="s2">know etc so what what happens is when</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.350" end="00:09:13.730" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with a complex system like</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.999" end="00:09:16.660" style="s2">human physiology and we if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.730" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">acute cause of an issue like an injury</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.660" end="00:09:20.689" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty good at that in medicine</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.920" end="00:09:21.769" style="s2">dealing with things like injuries it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.689" end="00:09:23.329" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t get a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.769" end="00:09:25.189" style="s2">an exponential tech will help us get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.329" end="00:09:29.329" style="s2">lot better but when we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.189" end="00:09:31.549" style="s2">something like cancer or autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.329" end="00:09:33.769" style="s2">disease or neurodegenerative disease or</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.549" end="00:09:37.489" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t have an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.769" end="00:09:39.649" style="s2">acute cause it has complex causation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.489" end="00:09:41.209" style="s2">that might mean that there isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.649" end="00:09:42.439" style="s2">cause there&#39;s a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.209" end="00:09:45.290" style="s2">causes and they might not be the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.439" end="00:09:47.439" style="s2">for different people so you might be</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.290" end="00:09:49.610" style="s2">looking autoimmune disease where</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.439" end="00:09:52.809" style="s2">infection was part some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.610" end="00:09:55.069" style="s2">subclinical infection was part of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.809" end="00:09:57.920" style="s2">destabilization of homeo dynamic systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.069" end="00:09:59.980" style="s2">and some kind of toxicity exposure and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.920" end="00:10:01.999" style="s2">maybe some kind of nutrient deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.980" end="00:10:03.889" style="s2">combined with some kind of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.999" end="00:10:06.769" style="s2">predisposition right all came together</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.889" end="00:10:09.529" style="s2">to lead to a series of imbalances that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.769" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">eventually we call MS or rheumatoid</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.529" end="00:10:14.509" style="s2">arthritis or whatever it is and so not</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">only might it be multifactorial right</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.509" end="00:10:19.610" style="s2">but it might have many steps of causal</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:22.689" style="s2">transform the infection leading to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.610" end="00:10:25.790" style="s2">changed immune cells leading to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.689" end="00:10:27.799" style="s2">autoimmune antibodies you know etc and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.790" end="00:10:30.949" style="s2">that happened over the course of time</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.799" end="00:10:32.809" style="s2">and you have this delayed time causation</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.949" end="00:10:35.299" style="s2">all of this makes it much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.809" end="00:10:37.629" style="s2">assess cause and effect and so you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.299" end="00:10:40.699" style="s2">really a deeper system that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.629" end="00:10:43.100" style="s2">working with one variable at a time and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.699" end="00:10:45.379" style="s2">where there&#39;s clear causation but they</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.100" end="00:10:48.290" style="s2">can do this kind of complex causal</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.379" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">assessment in the same way that we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.290" end="00:10:53.089" style="s2">just starting with functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:56.179" style="s2">and systems biology to try and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.089" end="00:10:56.839" style="s2">understand the human physiology more</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.179" end="00:10:58.939" style="s2">complexly</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.839" end="00:11:00.739" style="s2">but we have dealt with it pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.939" end="00:11:02.619" style="s2">like oh you have a tumor let&#39;s cut it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.739" end="00:11:06.230" style="s2">out rather than understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.619" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">carcinogenesis well cut it out or</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">radiate it out or poison it out and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:15.889" style="s2">we&#39;ve really dealt with global issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve dealt with the environment in very</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.889" end="00:11:21.709" style="s2">much the same way the temperature is too</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">high so let&#39;s do geoengineering to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.709" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">address decreasing temperature but</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:28.970" style="s2">that&#39;s not addressing the cause of why</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">the temperatures too high at all because</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.970" end="00:11:33.350" style="s2">we really don&#39;t know how to do that well</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:34.699" style="s2">enough there&#39;s too many complex economic</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.350" end="00:11:36.949" style="s2">and social and worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.699" end="00:11:38.810" style="s2">technological factors so we largely deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.949" end="00:11:40.070" style="s2">with it symptomatically well there with</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.810" end="00:11:41.570" style="s2">Ward&#39;s symptomatically without</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.070" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">understanding all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.570" end="00:11:46.250" style="s2">lead to patterns of human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:47.899" style="s2">behavior that lead to war and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.250" end="00:11:51.350" style="s2">say that one of the things I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.899" end="00:11:54.350" style="s2">interested in is understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.350" end="00:12:00.490" style="s2">universe is a complex not a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.350" end="00:12:04.519" style="s2">system that just like our computer our</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.519" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">as civilization has been complicated</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.649" end="00:12:14.779" style="s2">systems complex systems are anti fragile</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:17.690" style="s2">inherently like in a in a forest each</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.550" end="00:13:07.819" style="s2">have called civilization so far has been</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.370" end="00:14:45.140" style="s2">contextualized it brought it into a</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.140" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">in the process we&#39;re making we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.160" end="00:14:56.600" style="s2">actually making human civilization our</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:58.610" style="s2">whole habitability here fragile and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.600" end="00:15:01.730" style="s2">I&#39;m very interested in how we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.610" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">understand universe and nature and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.730" end="00:15:05.330" style="s2">reality better how we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:07.460" style="s2">complexity and self-organization better</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.330" end="00:15:09.650" style="s2">so that we can work with the systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.460" end="00:15:12.290" style="s2">that like economics is just made up</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.650" end="00:15:14.300" style="s2">monopoly right like what our governments</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.290" end="00:15:17.930" style="s2">are made up systems but ecology isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.300" end="00:15:19.670" style="s2">and biology isn&#39;t and psychology there</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.930" end="00:15:20.990" style="s2">are intrinsic stew it even though</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.670" end="00:15:22.640" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of made up stuff in there</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.990" end="00:15:23.900" style="s2">so how do we understand those better so</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:27.140" style="s2">that we can work with them in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.900" end="00:15:30.500" style="s2">support real thriving of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.140" end="00:15:34.070" style="s2">are fundamentally meaningful in trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.500" end="00:15:37.070" style="s2">to understand that and thinking thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.070" end="00:15:39.860" style="s2">how much expertise needs to go into it</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.070" end="00:15:40.670" style="s2">is but I was thinking back to what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.860" end="00:15:42.860" style="s2">first said about</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.670" end="00:15:45.740" style="s2">the nature of the body that when it say</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.860" end="00:15:47.840" style="s2">we have a disease or a disorder of some</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.740" end="00:15:52.100" style="s2">kind there can be so many interlaced</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.840" end="00:15:53.840" style="s2">interlocking causal factors yet doctors</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.100" end="00:15:56.960" style="s2">are often experts in just one of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.840" end="00:15:59.330" style="s2">so is there potentially an expert</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.960" end="00:16:02.450" style="s2">problem here that lots of people are in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.330" end="00:16:03.770" style="s2">their particular fields say economics</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.450" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">and they only see things through the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.770" end="00:16:10.250" style="s2">economics lens do we need to have more</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:12.620" style="s2">Jack&#39;s of all trades involved or is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.250" end="00:16:14.300" style="s2">a case of I don&#39;t know RiRi</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.620" end="00:16:18.770" style="s2">understanding what you need to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.300" end="00:16:20.360" style="s2">an expert yeah so an expert in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.770" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">complicated system see one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.360" end="00:16:23.390" style="s2">about a complicated system is you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:24.650" style="s2">break it apart into parts and understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.390" end="00:16:27.470" style="s2">the parts in isolation and put it back</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.650" end="00:16:29.060" style="s2">together and you don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.470" end="00:16:31.520" style="s2">kinds of synergies that you have in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.060" end="00:16:33.080" style="s2">complex self-organizing systems so no</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.520" end="00:16:34.610" style="s2">one has to understand every part of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.080" end="00:16:37.400" style="s2">computer because we can take it apart</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.610" end="00:16:39.620" style="s2">and put a new CPU in put a new hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.400" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">drive in and you notice that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.620" end="00:16:42.740" style="s2">treated bodies very much like that like</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:43.850" style="s2">oh this parts worn out let&#39;s take it out</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.740" end="00:16:45.770" style="s2">put a new one in or you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.850" end="00:16:47.000" style="s2">need this part as opposed to like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.770" end="00:16:48.740" style="s2">what happened with the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.000" end="00:16:51.500" style="s2">systems here and what role did it really</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.740" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">play and and you a gastroenterologist</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.500" end="00:16:56.360" style="s2">can&#39;t you know in a neurologist and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:16:58.040" style="s2">oncologist they can&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.360" end="00:17:00.080" style="s2">any of those parts independent of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.040" end="00:17:02.330" style="s2">other ones because what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.080" end="00:17:04.100" style="s2">the gut via the microbiome via the gut</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.330" end="00:17:06.440" style="s2">brain access via the enteric nervous</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.100" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">system via so many different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.440" end="00:17:09.950" style="s2">pathways is affecting what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:12.950" style="s2">in the nervous system and then all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.950" end="00:17:15.440" style="s2">the top-down mechanisms so there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.950" end="00:17:16.910" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t say that an expert</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.440" end="00:17:18.200" style="s2">problem is how I would describe it I</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.910" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">would say there&#39;s a problem of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.200" end="00:17:23.720" style="s2">specialization in complex systems where</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:27.020" style="s2">that is just not the right epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.720" end="00:17:29.630" style="s2">and Alfred North Whitehead wrote this</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.020" end="00:17:32.420" style="s2">great paper some decades ago called the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.630" end="00:17:36.920" style="s2">problem of over specialization he said</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.420" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">notice how we the smarter a kid is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.920" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">earlier we start moving them into</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:43.550" style="s2">specialization and we move them further</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:46.040" style="s2">and further into specialization so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.550" end="00:17:47.180" style="s2">by the time they do their PhD there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.040" end="00:17:49.100" style="s2">few people in the world that really</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.180" end="00:17:54.290" style="s2">understand their dissertation and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.100" end="00:17:56.660" style="s2">have relatively little abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.290" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">across domains lateral thinking into</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.660" end="00:17:59.780" style="s2">other spaces etc because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:01.310" style="s2">supposed to be able to do a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.780" end="00:18:02.780" style="s2">that specialized expertise and of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.310" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">we know there were benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.780" end="00:18:08.300" style="s2">specialization but I think then there</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:10.370" style="s2">were real problems with it you said so</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.300" end="00:18:13.160" style="s2">when all of our a students are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.370" end="00:18:16.010" style="s2">about tiny tiny parts then who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.160" end="00:18:18.380" style="s2">thinking about the hole and so we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.010" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">leaving two people who didn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.380" end="00:18:21.650" style="s2">excel that well to think about it or</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:26.030" style="s2">just nobody at all and it is just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.650" end="00:18:28.910" style="s2">complex kind of system but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.030" end="00:18:32.270" style="s2">necessarily the one that we want or that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.910" end="00:18:34.040" style="s2">works effectively so I wouldn&#39;t say what</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.270" end="00:18:36.110" style="s2">we want is jack-of-all-trades that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.040" end="00:18:38.750" style="s2">kind of a false dichotomy I would say</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.750" end="00:18:44.690" style="s2">and who are studying systems at all and</p>

<p begin="00:18:49.460" end="00:18:55.010" style="s2">they can so that they really have the</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.010" end="00:18:59.540" style="s2">systems that they&#39;re looking at and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.690" end="00:19:01.130" style="s2">work with them yes I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.540" end="00:19:02.570" style="s2">critical and I think it&#39;s been critical</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.130" end="00:19:07.310" style="s2">for a while but especially in the face</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.570" end="00:19:10.070" style="s2">of machine learning within narrow</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.310" end="00:19:12.260" style="s2">intelligence right now already and over</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.070" end="00:19:13.880" style="s2">the next little bit narrow intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.260" end="00:19:17.300" style="s2">via machine learning will just be better</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.880" end="00:19:21.940" style="s2">at us better than us at combinatorics</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.300" end="00:19:24.260" style="s2">with in finite spaces and it really is</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.940" end="00:19:26.030" style="s2">generalized intelligence that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.260" end="00:19:29.450" style="s2">meaningful place for humans to develop</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.030" end="00:19:32.150" style="s2">themselves and work yeah and in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.450" end="00:19:34.790" style="s2">case it&#39;s um it looks like the education</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.150" end="00:19:36.650" style="s2">system and the way that we value certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.790" end="00:19:38.450" style="s2">kinds of education is going to need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.650" end="00:19:40.610" style="s2">change and I&#39;ve heard you speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.450" end="00:19:43.640" style="s2">passionately and passionately in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.610" end="00:19:46.220" style="s2">past about an issue that we damp down</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.640" end="00:19:48.200" style="s2">kids curiosity in the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.220" end="00:19:49.670" style="s2">education systems and say no stop</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.200" end="00:19:51.470" style="s2">looking at that stop playing with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.670" end="00:19:54.710" style="s2">you need to go and learn these specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.470" end="00:19:57.050" style="s2">exercises so I wonder how you think we</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.710" end="00:19:59.780" style="s2">can reawaken that kind of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.050" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">without fear and when I say fear I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.780" end="00:20:04.910" style="s2">the fear of parents or older generations</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.330" style="s2">because they might want to nurture it in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.910" end="00:20:08.970" style="s2">their kids they might want</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.330" end="00:20:10.830" style="s2">understand the necessity for it but if</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.830" end="00:20:16.440" style="s2">cuz they&#39;ve only the parents have only</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.230" end="00:20:19.140" style="s2">got this old-fashioned education how can</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.440" end="00:20:23.070" style="s2">we overcome this this divide and find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.140" end="00:20:24.539" style="s2">way to nurture it in children the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.070" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">thing that we call modern Western</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.539" end="00:20:29.519" style="s2">education is not the only system of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:34.230" style="s2">Education that has ever been explored</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.519" end="00:20:37.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:39.630" style="s2">have the educational philosophy argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.860" end="00:20:41.639" style="s2">that it is just not even a very good one</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.630" end="00:20:43.820" style="s2">for many definitions of what is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.639" end="00:20:46.019" style="s2">meaningful way to educate a human being</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.820" end="00:20:49.049" style="s2">but when you look at kind of the history</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.019" end="00:20:53.130" style="s2">of how it came about and things like we</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.049" end="00:20:56.460" style="s2">need you know the movement into an</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.130" end="00:20:58.440" style="s2">industrial revolution where we needed</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.460" end="00:21:00.840" style="s2">people we needed a lot of people to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.440" end="00:21:03.510" style="s2">trained to fulfill roles within the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.840" end="00:21:05.610" style="s2">industrial revolution that we&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.510" end="00:21:07.409" style="s2">fungible right factory line workers were</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.610" end="00:21:08.580" style="s2">pretty fun like any of them could do</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.409" end="00:21:12.539" style="s2">basically what any of the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.580" end="00:21:13.559" style="s2">could do and MBAs are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.539" end="00:21:15.299" style="s2">able to do pretty much what the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.559" end="00:21:18.269" style="s2">ones can do and doctors and so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.299" end="00:21:20.309" style="s2">the society needs people to fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.269" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">these roles so how do we create both an</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.309" end="00:21:23.580" style="s2">extrinsic incentive economics to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">them to do it and how do we create an</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.580" end="00:21:27.750" style="s2">education system to train them up into</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">these roles were then we identify them</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.750" end="00:21:30.510" style="s2">with this role and this role is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">fun jables anyone else who had that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.510" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">training give or take a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.230" end="00:21:36.870" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be profound</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:38.760" style="s2">meaninglessness and that because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.870" end="00:21:40.740" style="s2">uniqueness of self is gone their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.760" end="00:21:45.330" style="s2">kind of self-directed process is gone</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.740" end="00:21:48.389" style="s2">right and again especially in the place</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.330" end="00:21:51.029" style="s2">of robotic automation where those jobs</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.389" end="00:21:53.820" style="s2">are going to be getting automated and</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.029" end="00:21:55.470" style="s2">not just physical robotic automation but</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.820" end="00:21:56.789" style="s2">even the deep deep learning through a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.470" end="00:21:58.110" style="s2">lot of the things that we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.789" end="00:22:04.230" style="s2">thinking things but things that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.110" end="00:22:08.039" style="s2">procedural aiza bulimics possible and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.230" end="00:22:09.779" style="s2">necessitates a foundational rethinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.039" end="00:22:11.309" style="s2">of what education should be for and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.779" end="00:22:13.620" style="s2">really like what society what</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.309" end="00:22:17.010" style="s2">civilization should be for and it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.620" end="00:22:19.450" style="s2">rather if we if we can decouple to where</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.010" end="00:22:21.909" style="s2">the jobs don&#39;t need the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.450" end="00:22:23.260" style="s2">to do them we can also decoupler to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.909" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">where the people don&#39;t need the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.260" end="00:22:26.620" style="s2">meaning start to actually change the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:29.080" style="s2">economic structure because we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.620" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">it to be a source of extrinsic incentive</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.080" end="00:22:32.740" style="s2">then we get to say okay now we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:35.230" style="s2">actually have a system of entry where</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.740" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">intrinsic incentive is deeper to both</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.230" end="00:22:40.029" style="s2">the economics and the education so what</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:45.240" style="s2">is an education system where the focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.029" end="00:22:48.450" style="s2">is facilitating each child&#39;s unique</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.240" end="00:22:52.539" style="s2">expression their unique passion interest</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.450" end="00:22:57.429" style="s2">curiosities capacities and following it</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.539" end="00:22:59.620" style="s2">right now you say how can parents how</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.429" end="00:23:01.570" style="s2">can teachers participate with that if</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.620" end="00:23:03.190" style="s2">they weren&#39;t facilitated that way and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.570" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.190" end="00:23:08.649" style="s2">and the kit the kids gonna ask them</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:10.630" style="s2">questions they don&#39;t know answers to if</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.649" end="00:23:12.760" style="s2">the parents earn this if they really are</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.630" end="00:23:15.480" style="s2">earnest about this they can go on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.760" end="00:23:21.519" style="s2">process of code discovery with their kid</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.480" end="00:23:23.350" style="s2">and when the kid says so why is the sky</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.519" end="00:23:25.059" style="s2">blue and the parent realizes that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.350" end="00:23:27.850" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know they remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.059" end="00:23:29.080" style="s2">something about diffraction but maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.850" end="00:23:31.779" style="s2">is reflecting the ocean they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.080" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">really fuck him outright then they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.779" end="00:23:40.029" style="s2">be like well let&#39;s pour it together yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:41.769" style="s2">and then rather than push for that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.029" end="00:23:43.480" style="s2">exploration to go in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.769" end="00:23:45.519" style="s2">they&#39;re interested in pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.480" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">the kids interest and ask them like war</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.519" end="00:23:49.090" style="s2">find out why they&#39;re interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:50.529" style="s2">and what there&#39;s what their intuition</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.090" end="00:23:53.710" style="s2">about it is what their thought is and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.529" end="00:23:56.519" style="s2">help help go through the process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.710" end="00:23:58.750" style="s2">helping them learn how to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.519" end="00:24:01.419" style="s2">facilitating their interest in life and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.750" end="00:24:05.100" style="s2">letting their interest in life and their</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.419" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">learning reignite the adults also I</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.100" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s a key ingredient</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:11.769" style="s2">that you mentioned I hadn&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">which is not only to go and find the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.769" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">answer for the kid but say first of all</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">what what do you think and why do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:24.039" style="s2">wonder that and try and tune into into</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:26.019" style="s2">the nature of that curiosity it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.039" end="00:24:27.789" style="s2">the dynamic that I often see and I even</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.019" end="00:24:29.830" style="s2">feel it myself is a sort of sense a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.789" end="00:24:31.510" style="s2">little bit of shame and fear if someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.830" end="00:24:33.040" style="s2">asked me a question I feel I ought to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.510" end="00:24:35.500" style="s2">know the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.040" end="00:24:38.020" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a kind of a conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.500" end="00:24:40.030" style="s2">about putting aside our own ego and need</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:42.760" style="s2">to appear there sitting way in front of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.030" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">others well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a few fun</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.760" end="00:24:49.210" style="s2">things here so let&#39;s first address the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:52.090" style="s2">part about asking the kid why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.210" end="00:24:55.150" style="s2">interested so the kid asks why the sky</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.090" end="00:24:56.020" style="s2">is blue maybe that was the question I</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.150" end="00:24:57.850" style="s2">asked in the moment but they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.020" end="00:25:00.670" style="s2">really curious about why any color has</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.850" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">color and they could just as easily ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.670" end="00:25:03.910" style="s2">why is the leaf green and they really</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:08.020" style="s2">just want to know what color is right</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.910" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">and or they&#39;re really asking kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.020" end="00:25:12.970" style="s2">question about God an existential thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:13.930" style="s2">is about like why did the Creator make</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.970" end="00:25:15.130" style="s2">it that way because that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.930" end="00:25:17.230" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking about it and so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.130" end="00:25:19.000" style="s2">they&#39;re there&#39;s a they&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.230" end="00:25:21.460" style="s2">things like why is anything the way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.000" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">it is or they&#39;re asking a question about</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.460" end="00:25:26.410" style="s2">why is it that we subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.060" style="s2">experience it as blue and does that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.410" end="00:25:29.320" style="s2">relate to what is objectively true and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.060" end="00:25:31.240" style="s2">do we all experience it the same way if</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:32.740" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you&#39;re gonna go in to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.240" end="00:25:35.350" style="s2">answering it the way you think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.740" end="00:25:37.270" style="s2">asking it and then you&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.350" end="00:25:38.650" style="s2">them get bored pretty quickly and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.270" end="00:25:41.860" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get frustrated and try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.650" end="00:25:44.260" style="s2">get them to pay attention and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.860" end="00:25:46.150" style="s2">pretty important to actually pay</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.260" end="00:25:49.720" style="s2">attention to what is the real inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.150" end="00:25:51.280" style="s2">and then not you go find the answer as</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.720" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">if the answer already fucking exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.280" end="00:25:54.340" style="s2">they might be asking questions the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:56.290" style="s2">answers don&#39;t fully exist - and you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.340" end="00:25:56.740" style="s2">to like be in that process of discovery</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.290" end="00:25:59.650" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.740" end="00:26:01.510" style="s2">where the answer matters less then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.650" end="00:26:03.370" style="s2">investigation the inquiry the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.510" end="00:26:04.510" style="s2">about it and some of the best questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.370" end="00:26:06.340" style="s2">or when they get to things where we</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.510" end="00:26:07.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know the answers and their</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.340" end="00:26:12.490" style="s2">intuition about it might be as good as</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.690" end="00:26:14.860" style="s2">anybody&#39;s yeah that&#39;s that the whole I</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.490" end="00:26:17.230" style="s2">guess the the stereotype the picture of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.860" end="00:26:19.990" style="s2">the from the mouths of babes thing where</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.230" end="00:26:22.600" style="s2">you start seeing the world from a new</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.990" end="00:26:24.940" style="s2">angle just because somebody is asking a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.600" end="00:26:28.240" style="s2">question which is unencumbered by years</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.940" end="00:26:30.430" style="s2">of cultural conditioning yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:33.310" style="s2">know if we&#39;re asking about so what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.260" end="00:26:44.950" style="s2">ask a question where we were the real</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:46.330" style="s2">answer right now is we don&#39;t fucking</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.950" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">know those are the best thinkers in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.330" end="00:26:50.950" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:52.929" style="s2">mentally disagree on this then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.950" end="00:26:55.090" style="s2">place where you get to actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.929" end="00:26:57.370" style="s2">dialogue with them really on equal</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.090" end="00:26:59.020" style="s2">footing because you actually can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.370" end="00:27:00.370" style="s2">though you can tell a whole history of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.020" end="00:27:02.110" style="s2">Western philosophy and Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.370" end="00:27:04.029" style="s2">philosophy on it you that still just</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.110" end="00:27:07.539" style="s2">brings you to I just told you a whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.029" end="00:27:09.419" style="s2">lot of things about why I don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.539" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">so if you can come back to the like</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.419" end="00:27:13.480" style="s2">fascination and the interest you and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:16.779" style="s2">you&#39;re in the same place as them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.480" end="00:27:20.500" style="s2">they do have they are touching it for</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.779" end="00:27:22.419" style="s2">the first time in different ways how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.500" end="00:27:25.510" style="s2">you think we can get to to detector the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.419" end="00:27:27.250" style="s2">other point that I mentioned is how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.510" end="00:27:30.789" style="s2">you think we can get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.250" end="00:27:32.529" style="s2">we&#39;re not worrying about admitting our</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.789" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">ignorant maybe it&#39;s not such a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.529" end="00:27:40.059" style="s2">to a child but I think that we in in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:42.700" style="s2">West loosely speaking it&#39;s it&#39;s seen as</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.059" end="00:27:46.230" style="s2">largely not okay to admit oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.700" end="00:27:52.690" style="s2">know even though I feel that I should</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.230" end="00:27:56.529" style="s2">yeah so I mean you can see what a great</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.690" end="00:28:02.529" style="s2">tool to control other people that is yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.529" end="00:28:05.380" style="s2">and you can see how little real freedom</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.529" end="00:28:07.510" style="s2">you have and how little real ability for</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.380" end="00:28:09.429" style="s2">peace or intimacy or honesty with other</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.510" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">people you have well that bullshit&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.429" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">running in you now let&#39;s step back and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:18.390" style="s2">think about it like this for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:21.130" style="s2">let&#39;s think about the field of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.390" end="00:28:24.669" style="s2">knowable and the field of the unknowable</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.130" end="00:28:26.200" style="s2">as ontological or ease well the thing of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.669" end="00:28:30.299" style="s2">them is epistemological Gauri&#39;s for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.200" end="00:28:34.710" style="s2">minute they expose what the differences</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.299" end="00:28:38.230" style="s2">yeah so ontology is in philosophy the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.710" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">the inquiry into the study of what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.230" end="00:28:43.860" style="s2">fundamentally real what exists and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:46.690" style="s2">epistemology is how do we know like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.860" end="00:28:47.830" style="s2">do we think this exists because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.690" end="00:28:49.390" style="s2">measuring it in all getting the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.830" end="00:28:51.159" style="s2">thing because we&#39;re experiencing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.390" end="00:28:53.049" style="s2">because we&#39;re into itting it because</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.159" end="00:28:56.639" style="s2">we&#39;re doing math like what is the what</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.049" end="00:28:59.770" style="s2">is the right process of coming to</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.639" end="00:29:01.210" style="s2">believe anything that we might believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.770" end="00:29:03.730" style="s2">so there&#39;s this deep relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.210" end="00:29:07.210" style="s2">between what we think is real and how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.730" end="00:29:09.940" style="s2">think about anything and so those are</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.210" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">some some of the deep categories and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.940" end="00:29:16.600" style="s2">philosophies so let&#39;s think about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:20.620" style="s2">knowable stuff and the unknowable stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.600" end="00:29:23.110" style="s2">now Heisenberg said a limit on no</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.620" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">ability at the quantum mechanical level</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.110" end="00:29:28.090" style="s2">right said the position and the momentum</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:30.130" style="s2">of a quantum particle are not</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.090" end="00:29:31.540" style="s2">simultaneously knowable and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.130" end="00:29:34.809" style="s2">big deal it wasn&#39;t an epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.540" end="00:29:36.309" style="s2">limit it wasn&#39;t we just can&#39;t get enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.809" end="00:29:38.380" style="s2">information about it it was an</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.309" end="00:29:39.820" style="s2">ontological limit they don&#39;t both exist</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.380" end="00:29:41.740" style="s2">at the same time at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.820" end="00:29:43.960" style="s2">quantum it does not actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.740" end="00:29:45.480" style="s2">fixed amount of momentum and a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.960" end="00:29:47.650" style="s2">amount of position it has something</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.480" end="00:29:49.270" style="s2">weirder than that like a probability</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.650" end="00:29:52.540" style="s2">distribution about how much of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.270" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">things it has and so there is a limit to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.540" end="00:29:58.030" style="s2">the knowable and then you say ok well</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:29:59.470" style="s2">how many quantum particles are there in</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.030" end="00:30:01.059" style="s2">the universe and what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.470" end="00:30:03.010" style="s2">interactions between them and how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.059" end="00:30:06.220" style="s2">unknowable is there from that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.010" end="00:30:08.950" style="s2">like ok that&#39;s you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.220" end="00:30:11.830" style="s2">profound set and girdle&#39;s incompleteness</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:13.510" style="s2">theorem said set a limit on the Nobel</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.830" end="00:30:15.460" style="s2">when it comes to mathematics right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.510" end="00:30:18.309" style="s2">foundational axiomatic set of math is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.460" end="00:30:21.550" style="s2">infinite well we you can&#39;t no infinite</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.309" end="00:30:27.040" style="s2">shit the nobles always finite but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.550" end="00:30:32.790" style="s2">unknowable is infinite so it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.040" end="00:30:32.790" style="s2">to get first that the unknowable is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.910" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">larger class than the knowable</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.120" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">fundamentally and then within the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:43.990" style="s2">knowable you have the known and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:45.790" style="s2">unknown and the known is I have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.990" end="00:30:47.559" style="s2">reasonable confidence margin through</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.790" end="00:30:50.740" style="s2">whatever process that my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.559" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">of this is pretty good and the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.740" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">is this is hypothetically knowable stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:59.020" style="s2">we just don&#39;t know it yet and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:31:02.500" style="s2">plenty of that within that the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.020" end="00:31:06.400" style="s2">is also a larger class than the known is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.500" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">within the knowable now why why am i</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.400" end="00:31:12.250" style="s2">specifying this I&#39;m specifying it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:13.420" style="s2">because if I think that I should know</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.250" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">most thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.420" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">then I actually just don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:23.320" style="s2">deepest things about the nature of no</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">ability itself and so that idea like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.320" end="00:31:27.010" style="s2">someone asked me something I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:28.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with me like to</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.010" end="00:31:35.650" style="s2">just realize how ridiculous that fucking</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.900" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">thought is yeah and its own ego and to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.650" end="00:31:42.280" style="s2">instead say okay well the there there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:45.790" style="s2">an infinite class of things I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.280" end="00:31:48.190" style="s2">and couldn&#39;t know and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.790" end="00:31:52.980" style="s2">bunch of things that I could know that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.190" end="00:31:56.820" style="s2">don&#39;t and that&#39;s forever and that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.980" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">fascinating right that is in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.820" end="00:32:02.710" style="s2">enthralling it&#39;s like you get to touch a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:06.550" style="s2">sense of awe in that and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.710" end="00:32:09.160" style="s2">reframe of just really getting how vast</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.550" end="00:32:12.220" style="s2">reality is and how complex and how deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.160" end="00:32:15.540" style="s2">in and then being able to have a totally</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.220" end="00:32:18.700" style="s2">different humility in relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.540" end="00:32:20.950" style="s2">there&#39;s an emotional and even spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.700" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">element to this I think that people find</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.950" end="00:32:25.630" style="s2">I found if you study something in depth</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:27.550" style="s2">so when you go into the subject at first</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.630" end="00:32:29.170" style="s2">you can make all sorts of strong and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.550" end="00:32:31.060" style="s2">sweeping claims because you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.170" end="00:32:33.670" style="s2">enough to know how complicated it is and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.060" end="00:32:36.910" style="s2">that&#39;s quite exciting and then the more</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.670" end="00:32:38.710" style="s2">that you learn you realize oh I feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.910" end="00:32:39.850" style="s2">like I have to equivocate over</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.710" end="00:32:41.920" style="s2">everything all the time because</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.850" end="00:32:44.260" style="s2">everything&#39;s so complicated I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.920" end="00:32:46.270" style="s2">could go back to when I knew less but</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.260" end="00:32:48.250" style="s2">then the transformation can happen where</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.270" end="00:32:52.410" style="s2">you can become comfortable knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.250" end="00:32:55.060" style="s2">you don&#39;t know much yeah so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.410" end="00:32:57.160" style="s2">this is a fun process right so we will</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.060" end="00:32:58.660" style="s2">see you go to academic conference and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.160" end="00:33:00.940" style="s2">you&#39;ll see the top scientists in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.660" end="00:33:03.370" style="s2">domain almost tripping over themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.940" end="00:33:05.950" style="s2">you do not make any real statements</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.370" end="00:33:07.150" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.950" end="00:33:08.680" style="s2">wrong in front of all the other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.150" end="00:33:10.150" style="s2">that probably know a shit ton of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.680" end="00:33:11.410" style="s2">that they that they don&#39;t know that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.150" end="00:33:14.560" style="s2">relevant where what this thing might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.410" end="00:33:16.360" style="s2">wrong and then you look at people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.560" end="00:33:18.430" style="s2">are radically less educated about a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.360" end="00:33:22.330" style="s2">field and you know adamant passionate</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.430" end="00:33:26.930" style="s2">about it so now I basically I shared</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.330" end="00:33:29.820" style="s2">half of the story so one half is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.930" end="00:33:32.520" style="s2">this is actually the this is a fun story</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.820" end="00:33:51.750" style="s2">in the in the pre-modern world and most</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.419" end="00:34:22.050" style="s2">I could reincarnate badly instead of</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.050" end="00:34:28.050" style="s2">enough that we can burn women as witches</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.050" end="00:34:32.850" style="s2">do because we have enough certainty</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.190" end="00:34:37.500" style="s2">about that rightness right right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.850" end="00:34:40.500" style="s2">science started to emerge and have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.500" end="00:34:44.310" style="s2">more success in in really important</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.500" end="00:34:47.850" style="s2">things like aiming canons and you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.850" end="00:34:53.490" style="s2">actually a part of why I proliferated</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.080" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">us the capacity for more certainty</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.730" end="00:35:00.900" style="s2">plenty of questions like do heavy things</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:02.550" style="s2">and light things or dense things and non</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.900" end="00:35:03.900" style="s2">dense things fall at the same speed we</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.550" end="00:35:06.780" style="s2">were able to start solving some of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.900" end="00:35:10.590" style="s2">stuff right and earth being round or</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.780" end="00:35:13.710" style="s2">flat or we and and so even though within</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.590" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">the philosophy of science the purely</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.710" end="00:35:19.320" style="s2">uncertainty holding it as very deep a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:21.390" style="s2">lot of people carried the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.320" end="00:35:23.460" style="s2">emotional orientation toward certainty</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.390" end="00:35:27.330" style="s2">into the way they did science and wanted</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.460" end="00:35:29.700" style="s2">to like be pretty sure that the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.330" end="00:35:32.570" style="s2">started with the universe are with a big</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.700" end="00:35:34.860" style="s2">bang and you know matter first and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.570" end="00:35:37.530" style="s2">biology and consciousness emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.860" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">neural networks and and this this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.530" end="00:35:44.009" style="s2">actually the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">an emotional structure of associating</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.009" end="00:35:52.259" style="s2">certainty with security and value and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:54.990" style="s2">associating uncertainty with insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.259" end="00:35:56.940" style="s2">fear and lack of value which create</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.990" end="00:35:59.749" style="s2">which is an emotional and existential</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.940" end="00:36:03.269" style="s2">bias leading to a cognate bias so then</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.749" end="00:36:04.859" style="s2">post-modernism saw these flaws and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.269" end="00:36:06.509" style="s2">said shit look at all the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.859" end="00:36:07.650" style="s2">fucked up in the name of over certainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.509" end="00:36:09.150" style="s2">all the things we were certain about</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.650" end="00:36:10.319" style="s2">what we were wrong late or even within</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.150" end="00:36:11.880" style="s2">the sciences when we were pretty certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.319" end="00:36:13.380" style="s2">we had it almost all figured out around</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.880" end="00:36:14.849" style="s2">the time of Maxwell&#39;s equations and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.380" end="00:36:16.829" style="s2">modern physics fucked it all up</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.849" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s just happened so many times</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.829" end="00:36:20.190" style="s2">we really shouldn&#39;t ever be certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:23.029" style="s2">about anything because historically</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.190" end="00:36:26.339" style="s2">we&#39;ve been wrong about all of it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.029" end="00:36:30.420" style="s2">whenever we were whenever we were over</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.339" end="00:36:33.450" style="s2">certain we could do really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.420" end="00:36:34.559" style="s2">stuff II and so then post-modernism said</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.450" end="00:36:36.990" style="s2">we should actually embrace uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.559" end="00:36:39.059" style="s2">about everything and kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.990" end="00:36:41.279" style="s2">certainty and of course I&#39;m radically</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.059" end="00:36:43.999" style="s2">simplifying all of pre-modern ISM and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.279" end="00:36:47.720" style="s2">then modernity and then post modernity</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.999" end="00:36:52.170" style="s2">but a move towards embrace uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.720" end="00:36:54.269" style="s2">and any idea any narrative is just one</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.170" end="00:36:58.019" style="s2">narrative and isn&#39;t fundamentally true</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.269" end="00:37:00.569" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know and so then it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.019" end="00:37:02.730" style="s2">pathologized certainty and made</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.569" end="00:37:07.470" style="s2">uncertainty laudable and I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.730" end="00:37:09.660" style="s2">those are untenable and you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.470" end="00:37:11.489" style="s2">can actually see some major problems in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.660" end="00:37:13.410" style="s2">the world from certain interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.489" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">of postmodern that have led to the post</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.410" end="00:37:20.339" style="s2">fact world that have led to increased</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:24.420" style="s2">likelihood for strongman leaders to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.339" end="00:37:27.809" style="s2">in in a post fact world but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.420" end="00:37:29.670" style="s2">part of maturity is having a mature</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.809" end="00:37:32.249" style="s2">relationship with certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.670" end="00:37:34.380" style="s2">uncertainty inside of ourselves and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.249" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s what you could call it epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.380" end="00:37:39.960" style="s2">maturity which is I have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">confidence margin for certainty about</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.960" end="00:37:45.720" style="s2">these things based on the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:49.079" style="s2">processes that I went through to come to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.720" end="00:37:50.309" style="s2">it and I have less confidence margin</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.079" end="00:37:52.570" style="s2">about these things and I have no</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.309" end="00:37:54.820" style="s2">confidence margin about these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.570" end="00:37:57.070" style="s2">but my security and universe and my</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.820" end="00:38:00.850" style="s2">self-worth aren&#39;t coupled to any of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.070" end="00:38:02.470" style="s2">yeah yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s a big point</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.850" end="00:38:03.880" style="s2">that people become so emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.470" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">wrapped up in there and as you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.880" end="00:38:09.370" style="s2">talking about that post-modernism there</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:11.650" style="s2">I thought of someone who we featured on</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.370" end="00:38:14.800" style="s2">the site quite a bit Jordan Peterson who</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.650" end="00:38:17.890" style="s2">has a particular kind of gripe against</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.800" end="00:38:19.840" style="s2">who he calls post modernists and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.890" end="00:38:22.810" style="s2">people he&#39;s talking about seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.840" end="00:38:26.130" style="s2">gone kind of full circle where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.810" end="00:38:29.020" style="s2">become very certain about their position</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.130" end="00:38:31.270" style="s2">where things they&#39;re saying well there</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.020" end="00:38:33.100" style="s2">is no inherent truth in anything and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.270" end="00:38:36.100" style="s2">particular we&#39;ll talk about say cultural</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.100" end="00:38:37.510" style="s2">relativism or cultural appropriation but</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.100" end="00:38:39.610" style="s2">they&#39;ve suddenly become dogmatic about</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.510" end="00:38:42.790" style="s2">it which seems to totally contradict the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.610" end="00:38:44.350" style="s2">original point if you read Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.790" end="00:38:46.330" style="s2">where Derrida or some of the good</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.350" end="00:38:48.130" style="s2">postmodern philosophers there was like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.330" end="00:38:49.630" style="s2">real insights there right there were</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.130" end="00:38:52.540" style="s2">they were key important insights and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.630" end="00:38:54.130" style="s2">they were not equally like the critiques</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.540" end="00:38:56.230" style="s2">were not about all of the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.130" end="00:39:01.090" style="s2">equally if you look at say the way we</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.230" end="00:39:02.920" style="s2">did social sciences and all of the bias</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.090" end="00:39:05.290" style="s2">that affects how we do social science</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.920" end="00:39:09.600" style="s2">that is gonna affect the way we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.290" end="00:39:13.600" style="s2">chemistry less right not none but less</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.600" end="00:39:15.190" style="s2">and so you know there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.600" end="00:39:19.540" style="s2">important insights there but when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.190" end="00:39:21.940" style="s2">look at so let you know let&#39;s take a fun</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.540" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">case let&#39;s take the conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.940" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">Sam Harris and Dan Dennett about</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:30.040" style="s2">freewill and consciousness these guys</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:33.820" style="s2">are on the same team when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.040" end="00:39:37.000" style="s2">you know atheism and the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.820" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">superstitious ideas and religious</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.000" end="00:39:42.550" style="s2">metaphysical ideas but then when it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:44.470" style="s2">comes to foundational ontology itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.550" end="00:39:46.210" style="s2">they actually disagreed on the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.470" end="00:39:49.210" style="s2">things one could disagree on right sam</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.210" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">says consciousness is real but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.210" end="00:39:52.180" style="s2">no free will</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:55.150" style="s2">and Dan said no there is free will but</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.180" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">consciousness is not real like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.150" end="00:39:59.500" style="s2">our the deepest and they and they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:00.700" style="s2">both philosophers of science and both</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.500" end="00:40:02.050" style="s2">have read the same books and both</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.700" end="00:40:03.190" style="s2">understand critical thinking it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.050" end="00:40:04.500" style="s2">well how the fuck could they come to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.190" end="00:40:07.890" style="s2">things that are bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.500" end="00:40:09.930" style="s2">and it you know and Sam actually said</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.890" end="00:40:12.510" style="s2">something really important in the end of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.930" end="00:40:14.069" style="s2">that dialogue if and if you if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.510" end="00:40:16.140" style="s2">read it but it was a fun one</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.069" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">he said it seems that we just have</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.140" end="00:40:21.630" style="s2">fundamentally different intuitions and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:24.839" style="s2">or she is something to that effect and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.630" end="00:40:26.130" style="s2">that that is actually like nai there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.839" end="00:40:27.660" style="s2">this thing called the symbol grounding</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.130" end="00:40:31.790" style="s2">problem how do we get the symbols to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.660" end="00:40:34.859" style="s2">ground into experience right when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.790" end="00:40:36.450" style="s2">when you think of an apple you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.859" end="00:40:39.809" style="s2">things about the way an apple can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.450" end="00:40:42.180" style="s2">tart or sweet or mealy or its skin can</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.809" end="00:40:45.510" style="s2">kind of peel off or it can snap or like</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.180" end="00:40:48.030" style="s2">you have so many interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.510" end="00:40:50.940" style="s2">contextual things and you&#39;ve taken it in</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.030" end="00:40:53.400" style="s2">through a tongue and a nose and your</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.940" end="00:40:55.770" style="s2">fingers in so many sensory organs plus</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.400" end="00:40:58.049" style="s2">the abstraction layers of it that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.770" end="00:40:59.849" style="s2">symbol has grounded right the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.049" end="00:41:03.059" style="s2">Apple has grounded through all of those</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.849" end="00:41:04.589" style="s2">sentry channels and so if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.059" end="00:41:05.730" style="s2">had some of the same sensory channels</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.589" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.730" end="00:41:09.990" style="s2">grounding in the same way so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:12.599" style="s2">studying the chemistry of an apple but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.990" end="00:41:14.250" style="s2">haven&#39;t tasted it no matter how much</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.599" end="00:41:16.290" style="s2">fucking chemistry about an apple I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.250" end="00:41:18.030" style="s2">got and I know what the EEG patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.290" end="00:41:21.589" style="s2">people tasting it are I still don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.030" end="00:41:21.589" style="s2">what the fucking Apple tastes like and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.890" end="00:41:28.049" style="s2">so there is a place at which as much as</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to be totally objective and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.049" end="00:41:35.369" style="s2">logical what what when we hear it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:38.780" style="s2">land as true or not has to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.369" end="00:41:43.290" style="s2">some experience set that lands as true</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.780" end="00:41:45.480" style="s2">has to it is not a purely those axioms</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.290" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">are reasonable and can be later reified</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.480" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">by the process and this this was a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">process for deriving other things from</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:41:56.099" style="s2">those axioms I accept it then one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:58.140" style="s2">main sources of our cognitive bias isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.099" end="00:41:59.819" style="s2">just the normal logical fallacies</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.140" end="00:42:02.549" style="s2">everybody you know those are easy to</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.819" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">study it&#39;s a bunch of emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.549" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">existential level biases that affect the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:13.370" style="s2">way we process and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:16.580" style="s2">really subtle work comes in</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.370" end="00:42:20.540" style="s2">few examples yeah remember the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.580" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">time that this hit me was so clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.540" end="00:42:27.380" style="s2">very long time ago but I was I was young</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:30.020" style="s2">I was talking to someone about there</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.380" end="00:42:33.430" style="s2">were religious persuasion they had moved</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.020" end="00:42:38.450" style="s2">from being a kind of New Age Hindu to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.430" end="00:42:41.470" style="s2">fundamentalist Muslim and that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.450" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">like a very and they did that while in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.470" end="00:42:47.750" style="s2">mmm California upper class I&#39;m like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.450" style="s2">seems like a very interesting step that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.750" end="00:42:53.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make that much sense to me and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.450" end="00:42:55.970" style="s2">so I asked them questions about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.090" end="00:42:58.220" style="s2">theology of Islam and if they really</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.970" end="00:43:01.130" style="s2">believed these aspects of the theology</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.220" end="00:43:04.340" style="s2">and and it wasn&#39;t getting anywhere like</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.130" end="00:43:06.470" style="s2">it there was no place where they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.340" end="00:43:07.820" style="s2">really willing to look at the aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.470" end="00:43:11.390" style="s2">the theology I was pretty sure they</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.820" end="00:43:12.890" style="s2">probably didn&#39;t believe and but in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.390" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">process of the way I was asking I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.890" end="00:43:17.060" style="s2">actually damaging my rapport with this</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:19.310" style="s2">person and in damaging rapport I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.060" end="00:43:20.780" style="s2">damaging the ability to actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.310" end="00:43:24.200" style="s2">meaningful conversation about this or</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.780" end="00:43:26.510" style="s2">any topic right and so I stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.200" end="00:43:28.730" style="s2">then I came back to let me see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.510" end="00:43:31.370" style="s2">just create rapport about anything we</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.730" end="00:43:32.510" style="s2">get rapport fast forward about a year</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.370" end="00:43:34.310" style="s2">because it takes that much time to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.510" end="00:43:38.800" style="s2">repair the rapport from an issue like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.310" end="00:43:42.500" style="s2">this and I ended up finding out that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.800" end="00:43:43.550" style="s2">this person comes to Islam and their</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.500" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">particular belief someone saying this</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.550" end="00:43:46.340" style="s2">would be true for everyone I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:50.540" style="s2">this one case this was a place of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.340" end="00:43:53.720" style="s2">realizing this person&#39;s past was that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.540" end="00:43:55.160" style="s2">they actually couldn&#39;t say no and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.720" end="00:43:57.590" style="s2">couldn&#39;t set limits or boundaries from</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.160" end="00:43:58.610" style="s2">themselves because of like family sexual</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.590" end="00:44:03.440" style="s2">trauma that had happened in their</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.610" end="00:44:05.690" style="s2">childhood and they got to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.440" end="00:44:07.100" style="s2">they were there were some things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.690" end="00:44:09.310" style="s2">happened in their life and because they</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.100" end="00:44:11.570" style="s2">couldn&#39;t say no to some fairly terrible</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.310" end="00:44:13.130" style="s2">things that led to their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.570" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">breaking whatever and they they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.130" end="00:44:18.770" style="s2">oh wow I&#39;m gonna die basically because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:21.290" style="s2">can&#39;t set limits or say no and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.770" end="00:44:23.090" style="s2">right around that time they met a friend</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.290" end="00:44:25.220" style="s2">who had just joined Islam and they were</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.090" end="00:44:27.330" style="s2">talking about it and the rules and kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.220" end="00:44:32.150" style="s2">of the absoluteness of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.330" end="00:44:35.250" style="s2">rulz and that they didn&#39;t have to hold</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.150" end="00:44:37.560" style="s2">boundaries themselves they just being</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.250" end="00:44:40.590" style="s2">someone who believed that got to follow</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.560" end="00:44:43.080" style="s2">those rules and at a survival level that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.590" end="00:44:46.080" style="s2">told this person oh she could actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.080" end="00:44:49.560" style="s2">survive because she could adopt a rule</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.080" end="00:44:51.990" style="s2">set that she now she could say no with</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.560" end="00:44:53.370" style="s2">that reason it bought it bypassed her</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.990" end="00:44:56.970" style="s2">childhood reasons of not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.370" end="00:44:59.010" style="s2">say no and so what I realized was it had</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.970" end="00:45:01.860" style="s2">nothing to do with theology even though</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.010" end="00:45:05.430" style="s2">later the theology back felled itself as</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.860" end="00:45:07.110" style="s2">a rationalization and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.430" end="00:45:08.460" style="s2">addressing it it totally the wrong level</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.110" end="00:45:10.290" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t the level at which the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.460" end="00:45:12.510" style="s2">decision was made the choice wasn&#39;t made</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.290" end="00:45:14.640" style="s2">by a deep rational introspection and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.510" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">study of the theology compared to other</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.640" end="00:45:22.050" style="s2">theologies and so then when I talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:25.980" style="s2">with them about basically just childhood</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.050" end="00:45:28.590" style="s2">and their ability to say no and set</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.980" end="00:45:30.330" style="s2">boundaries and construct those</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.590" end="00:45:32.370" style="s2">capacities inside of them rather than</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.330" end="00:45:33.540" style="s2">try to deconstruct a belief once</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.370" end="00:45:35.700" style="s2">actually felt they had that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.540" end="00:45:39.210" style="s2">they ended up deconstructing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.700" end="00:45:41.130" style="s2">religious belief on their own their</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.210" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">critical thinking couldn&#39;t kick in</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.130" end="00:45:44.790" style="s2">because it was if their critical</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.200" style="s2">thinking kicked in or if they allowed</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.790" end="00:45:48.390" style="s2">anyone else&#39;s critical thinking to kick</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.200" end="00:45:50.940" style="s2">in it would hit a survival level fear</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.390" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">for them of a belief that was meeting a</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.940" end="00:45:55.860" style="s2">need and maybe it&#39;s the need to get to</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:57.210" style="s2">still be part of your family because if</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.860" end="00:45:58.440" style="s2">you leave the religion you won&#39;t be part</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.210" end="00:46:00.630" style="s2">of the family or you won&#39;t be part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.440" end="00:46:02.760" style="s2">the community or or you&#39;re too afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.630" end="00:46:05.910" style="s2">death and so you know there&#39;s an extent</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.760" end="00:46:08.430" style="s2">whatever it is or it&#39;s it&#39;s a situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.910" end="00:46:09.990" style="s2">where if you say this particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.430" end="00:46:13.260" style="s2">inside of academia and inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.990" end="00:46:15.240" style="s2">sciences you will be shunned for saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.260" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">something that is so non-standard model</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.240" end="00:46:19.020" style="s2">that you lose all kinds of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:24.170" style="s2">so there&#39;s like all these little subtle</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.020" end="00:46:26.700" style="s2">and not-so-subtle sources of bias that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.170" end="00:46:31.740" style="s2">affect the process of how we go about</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.700" end="00:46:34.050" style="s2">understanding reality it&#39;s it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.740" end="00:46:35.790" style="s2">same sort of mechanism and thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.050" end="00:46:37.800" style="s2">when you make a big change in your life</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.790" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">or maybe you leave a place of employment</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.800" end="00:46:42.540" style="s2">and people become angry with you because</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">changing you&#39;re not what they expected</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.540" end="00:46:46.200" style="s2">anymore because for them there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:49.470" style="s2">they could receive it as an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.200" end="00:46:52.320" style="s2">implicit criticism of themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.470" end="00:46:54.510" style="s2">their choices and that&#39;s all happening</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.320" end="00:46:55.980" style="s2">kind of as a subtext and people are</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.510" end="00:46:59.250" style="s2">getting angry and they maybe don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.980" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">why they&#39;re angry yeah yeah so now you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.250" end="00:47:05.340" style="s2">come back to the cultural relativism and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:07.890" style="s2">you see okay someone might have taken</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.340" end="00:47:11.460" style="s2">postmodern philosophy and used it as</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.890" end="00:47:13.770" style="s2">cognitive backfill to positions that</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.260" end="00:47:27.180" style="s2">the topic it might have been their own</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.780" end="00:47:28.980" style="s2">trauma or witnessing a trauma in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.180" end="00:47:30.690" style="s2">world that was so problematic that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.980" end="00:47:33.740" style="s2">took it on or resonated with it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.690" end="00:47:36.030" style="s2">that&#39;s affecting then the way they are</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.740" end="00:47:37.560" style="s2">you know what they&#39;re resonating with</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.030" end="00:47:42.540" style="s2">intellectually and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.560" end="00:47:44.280" style="s2">processing it do you how do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.540" end="00:47:46.530" style="s2">can become more aware of that in</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.280" end="00:47:50.670" style="s2">ourselves if we if we start from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.530" end="00:47:52.860" style="s2">point that we&#39;re willing to become more</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.670" end="00:47:54.690" style="s2">aware of it a lot of these things just</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.860" end="00:47:56.550" style="s2">sort of well up as emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.690" end="00:47:59.070" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s useful and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.550" end="00:48:01.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not but maybe if we take the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.070" end="00:48:05.370" style="s2">example of cultural appropriation which</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.710" end="00:48:07.500" style="s2">is such a hot topic at the moment how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.370" end="00:48:09.870" style="s2">you see that playing out for people</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.500" end="00:48:12.180" style="s2">emotionally and how I&#39;m and how might we</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.870" end="00:48:16.380" style="s2">be able to have a more productive self</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.180" end="00:48:20.430" style="s2">reflective conversation about it well</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.380" end="00:48:23.790" style="s2">one good thing is I want to see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.430" end="00:48:29.630" style="s2">take both sides or any side of the topic</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.790" end="00:48:29.630" style="s2">well enough that I really get it II and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.930" end="00:48:37.350" style="s2">if I can&#39;t if while I&#39;m trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.440" end="00:48:38.940" style="s2">the other side I feel like I&#39;m mocking</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.350" end="00:48:42.150" style="s2">it the whole time because it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.940" end="00:48:44.280" style="s2">so stupid then there is some bias that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.150" end="00:48:45.840" style="s2">won&#39;t actually allow me to see reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.280" end="00:48:50.310" style="s2">through that lens and see if I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.840" end="00:48:52.950" style="s2">anything needs and so then part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.310" end="00:48:54.330" style="s2">earnestness would be can I actually do I</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.950" end="00:48:57.060" style="s2">know that I&#39;m seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.330" end="00:48:59.430" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing or am i I might not be</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.060" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">but I actually like notice how many</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.430" end="00:49:04.530" style="s2">times there&#39;s a I want to stay in with</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:10.020" style="s2">the people who share a belief similar to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.530" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">me or coming to this belief that I had</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.020" end="00:49:13.770" style="s2">answered some really critical things</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:15.120" style="s2">that made me feel more okay or like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.770" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">had my shit together or safer in</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.120" end="00:49:19.140" style="s2">universe or smarter and leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:22.950" style="s2">feel scary you know you know you notice</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.140" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">all those kinds of things and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.950" end="00:49:34.140" style="s2">say the degree to which we can identify</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:37.620" style="s2">with our own earnestness to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.140" end="00:49:39.570" style="s2">explore more than our current position</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.620" end="00:49:41.370" style="s2">about things that&#39;s a much better</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.570" end="00:49:45.720" style="s2">identity to the degree we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.370" end="00:49:48.300" style="s2">one mmm I think with with the example of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.720" end="00:49:49.860" style="s2">cultural appropriation when I try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.300" end="00:49:51.870" style="s2">think into the mind of someone who</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.860" end="00:49:52.560" style="s2">thinks that it&#39;s pretty much always a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.870" end="00:49:56.010" style="s2">bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.560" end="00:49:59.010" style="s2">it goes I&#39;ve sort of two rough pictures</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.010" end="00:50:00.840" style="s2">of what that can be driven by and one is</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.010" end="00:50:03.210" style="s2">the more negative kind of wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.840" end="00:50:05.220" style="s2">virtue signal and want to be right on</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.210" end="00:50:07.350" style="s2">and sort of a cruise the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.220" end="00:50:09.540" style="s2">certainty we talked about before that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.350" end="00:50:11.640" style="s2">know that this is the this is wrong to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.540" end="00:50:12.660" style="s2">do it&#39;s morally wrong and therefore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.640" end="00:50:15.150" style="s2">a good person</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.660" end="00:50:18.030" style="s2">and the other I think comes from a place</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.150" end="00:50:20.520" style="s2">of pain that it&#39;s hard to want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.030" end="00:50:23.490" style="s2">identify with that if you feel that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.520" end="00:50:26.220" style="s2">your culture or the culture of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.490" end="00:50:26.970" style="s2">parents and relatives has been taken and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.220" end="00:50:30.120" style="s2">abused</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.970" end="00:50:32.190" style="s2">that&#39;s quite a deep hurt and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.120" end="00:50:34.100" style="s2">coming from a place where you feel there</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.190" end="00:50:37.320" style="s2">is no understanding of you it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.100" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">alienation pain and that&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.320" end="00:50:44.040" style="s2">uncomfortable to enter into yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:47.130" style="s2">think this is a good process right where</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.040" end="00:50:49.710" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not making everyone who</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.130" end="00:50:52.110" style="s2">believes that cultural appropriation is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.710" end="00:50:53.070" style="s2">an issue in the same category you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.110" end="00:50:56.250" style="s2">acknowledging that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.070" end="00:50:58.230" style="s2">different epistemologies and different</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.250" end="00:50:59.610" style="s2">processes that bring them there which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.230" end="00:51:01.710" style="s2">key and then you&#39;re kind of feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.610" end="00:51:04.050" style="s2">what those could be and some that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.710" end="00:51:06.810" style="s2">can really empathize with this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.050" end="00:51:08.430" style="s2">topic that I would say I have very deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.810" end="00:51:10.440" style="s2">familiarity or expert</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.430" end="00:51:12.930" style="s2">Easter&#39;s but but as I just think into it</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.440" end="00:51:14.370" style="s2">right now with you there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.930" end="00:51:18.360" style="s2">things that come up right as I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.370" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">about someone who says cultural</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.360" end="00:51:23.280" style="s2">appropriation is wrong and why that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:27.450" style="s2">would be I can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.280" end="00:51:29.730" style="s2">reasons mmm deeper than just even the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.450" end="00:51:33.540" style="s2">pain of a culture that has been damaged</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.730" end="00:51:36.390" style="s2">by another culture II I can imagine very</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.540" end="00:51:37.980" style="s2">real reason so let&#39;s say we take hey</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.390" end="00:51:40.290" style="s2">white people shouldn&#39;t wear dreadlocks</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.980" end="00:51:42.420" style="s2">so they shouldn&#39;t wear hindu bindi so</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.290" end="00:51:44.970" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t you know where my Hari</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.420" end="00:51:48.600" style="s2">Krishna chika ponytails or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.970" end="00:51:51.480" style="s2">whatever it is right well then you say</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.600" end="00:51:54.150" style="s2">well what were those things well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.480" end="00:51:57.600" style="s2">a superficial answer which is they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.150" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">some aesthetic whatever right but then</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.600" end="00:52:04.860" style="s2">you go deeper well it was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:08.450" style="s2">signaling mechanism of people who had</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.860" end="00:52:11.490" style="s2">went through so say say in getting that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.450" end="00:52:13.110" style="s2">that Brahman string or getting that mall</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.490" end="00:52:15.570" style="s2">or getting that whatever it was they had</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.110" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">actually went through specific ritual</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.570" end="00:52:20.370" style="s2">specific processes practices worldview</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:22.380" style="s2">or then they could see anyone else who</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.370" end="00:52:23.490" style="s2">had that and they could know here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.380" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">person that I&#39;m gonna have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.490" end="00:52:27.770" style="s2">amount of shared experience with and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:30.270" style="s2">created a signaling that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.770" end="00:52:32.430" style="s2">relevant not only maybe for survival</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.270" end="00:52:33.510" style="s2">which it very much might have been in</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.430" end="00:52:35.580" style="s2">the world where in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.510" end="00:52:38.280" style="s2">dynamics are determined most of survival</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.580" end="00:52:40.740" style="s2">but also their ability for deeper</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.280" end="00:52:43.170" style="s2">connection trust coherence and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.740" end="00:52:44.520" style="s2">like okay that that that actually meant</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.170" end="00:52:49.590" style="s2">something sacred</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.520" end="00:52:51.660" style="s2">II and now if someone else is is taking</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.590" end="00:52:54.270" style="s2">that thing without all that it meant now</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.660" end="00:52:55.740" style="s2">I actually don&#39;t know my signaling</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.270" end="00:52:57.090" style="s2">system is broken and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.740" end="00:53:00.230" style="s2">these are people with shared experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.090" end="00:53:05.820" style="s2">or not or and so you think about like</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.230" end="00:53:08.760" style="s2">there might be layers of depth that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.820" end="00:53:11.640" style="s2">you&#39;re just completely missing in an</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.760" end="00:53:14.010" style="s2">argument when you come to a position on</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.640" end="00:53:16.080" style="s2">it and I&#39;m not saying I think cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.010" end="00:53:19.560" style="s2">appropriation is always wrong I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.080" end="00:53:21.810" style="s2">I as I start to imagine in I can think</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.560" end="00:53:22.210" style="s2">of a lot of things and I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.810" end="00:53:25.180" style="s2">listen</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.210" end="00:53:27.220" style="s2">a lot and I&#39;d want to see can I be</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.180" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">earnest about it or does something come</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.220" end="00:53:33.490" style="s2">up in me they starts to get blocked and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:35.080" style="s2">if it does I want to look at that well I</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.490" end="00:53:36.760" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s a great attitude is</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.080" end="00:53:39.760" style="s2">both self reflective and asking</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.760" end="00:53:42.070" style="s2">questions but also not seeking to have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.760" end="00:53:44.859" style="s2">certainty at the at the end of it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.070" end="00:53:47.050" style="s2">what what comes up for me when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.859" end="00:53:50.770" style="s2">describing those sorts of single as</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.050" end="00:53:54.010" style="s2">symbol systems and how we can read those</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.770" end="00:53:56.230" style="s2">things is is it at the core that we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.010" end="00:53:58.660" style="s2">as humans trying to understand each</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.230" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">other and improve ourselves are we kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.660" end="00:54:03.460" style="s2">of tripping over a kind of an innate</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">nature which is tribal and wanting</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.460" end="00:54:08.560" style="s2">certain systems to make sense and apply</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:15.730" style="s2">to everybody is that something that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.560" end="00:54:21.070" style="s2">can overcome they question it a dumpling</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.730" end="00:54:24.550" style="s2">is there different questions let me</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.070" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">separate are we tribal and signaling</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.550" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">mechanisms in human nature</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:32.349" style="s2">sure signaling mechanisms were actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:36.820" style="s2">part of what helped us go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.349" end="00:54:39.190" style="s2">tribalism because if I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.820" end="00:54:41.619" style="s2">hunter-gatherer society pre agrarian</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.190" end="00:54:43.599" style="s2">society and we&#39;re below Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.619" end="00:54:47.320" style="s2">right typically below 150 people maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:48.790" style="s2">meaningfully below them I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.320" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">need signaling mechanisms because I know</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.790" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">all the people like I firsthand actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:54.970" style="s2">know them all I&#39;ve lived with in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:56.170" style="s2">whole life and I know if it&#39;s the people</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.970" end="00:54:58.750" style="s2">that I know and can trust or other</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.170" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">people that I don&#39;t know and so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.750" end="00:55:03.250" style="s2">actually don&#39;t need symbolism because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:06.640" style="s2">don&#39;t need an abstraction layer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.250" end="00:55:12.040" style="s2">actually in my instantiated experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.640" end="00:55:13.750" style="s2">right okay and now if we want to get a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.040" end="00:55:16.869" style="s2">number of tribes to be able to come</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.750" end="00:55:19.020" style="s2">together into villages and then kingdoms</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.869" end="00:55:21.070" style="s2">and the nation-states or you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.020" end="00:55:23.170" style="s2">religious associations or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.070" end="00:55:25.540" style="s2">larger kind of entity that has some</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.170" end="00:55:27.369" style="s2">coherence then the question is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.540" end="00:55:29.349" style="s2">have coherence with other people that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.369" end="00:55:33.609" style="s2">don&#39;t know but that we&#39;ve chosen to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.349" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">coherence for coherence with in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.609" end="00:55:41.450" style="s2">situation where that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:43.400" style="s2">survival relevant mmm and now signaling</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.450" end="00:55:48.620" style="s2">mechanisms were a major part of how that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.400" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">happened right so now you know your red</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.620" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">team or blue team the fact that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:53.210" style="s2">got a red shirt on even though I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:54.680" style="s2">met you like I know that we&#39;re pleased</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.210" end="00:55:56.030" style="s2">that you&#39;re playing on my side that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.680" end="00:55:57.980" style="s2">called the what flag are you flying</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.030" end="00:55:59.930" style="s2">right and so you notice with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.980" end="00:56:01.130" style="s2">cultural appropriation like there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.930" end="00:56:03.830" style="s2">people who get pretty bent out of shape</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.130" end="00:56:05.300" style="s2">of someone who isn&#39;t a citizen of their</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.830" end="00:56:08.780" style="s2">country using their flag in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.300" end="00:56:12.500" style="s2">way yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a similar thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.780" end="00:56:15.260" style="s2">right I mean so it&#39;s a related topic of</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.500" end="00:56:18.320" style="s2">wait this is a way that our group was</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.260" end="00:56:20.770" style="s2">able to maintain some coherence against</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.320" end="00:56:23.870" style="s2">forces that were arrayed against it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.770" end="00:56:28.490" style="s2">you know you think about like how would</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.870" end="00:56:29.510" style="s2">US or or UK military deal with if</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.490" end="00:56:30.950" style="s2">someone was fucking up their</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.510" end="00:56:32.240" style="s2">intelligence system right and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.950" end="00:56:35.960" style="s2">signals that were coming in to their</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:38.270" style="s2">Intel like that would be a problem if if</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.960" end="00:56:39.800" style="s2">you see someone like the crime of being</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.270" end="00:56:42.290" style="s2">dressed as a police officer if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.800" end="00:56:44.060" style="s2">not a police officer or being dressed as</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.290" end="00:56:46.040" style="s2">a military official is actually a crime</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.060" end="00:56:51.380" style="s2">because that system of signaling is very</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.040" end="00:56:55.310" style="s2">meaningful and and so one thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.380" end="00:56:58.580" style="s2">say is like now many of those systems</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.310" end="00:57:00.290" style="s2">have have interspersed so much that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.580" end="00:57:01.610" style="s2">then have cultures like the u.s. that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.290" end="00:57:02.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have a culture right it</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.610" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">has the mix of a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.900" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">different things because it&#39;s fairly new</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:12.020" style="s2">and and and so then of course it makes</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">sense to allow those cultures to come</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.020" end="00:57:17.360" style="s2">together and to make new emergent things</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:19.460" style="s2">from one perspective from another</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.360" end="00:57:21.980" style="s2">perspective if some of those subgroups</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.460" end="00:57:24.050" style="s2">feel like they are still needing to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.980" end="00:57:26.390" style="s2">maintain some of their identity for</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.050" end="00:57:28.310" style="s2">survival or thriving reasons then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.390" end="00:57:30.890" style="s2">like wait fuck this is a real issue and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.310" end="00:57:32.660" style="s2">oh yeah by the way the US was built on</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.890" end="00:57:35.950" style="s2">slavery and on the genocide and if that</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.660" end="00:57:39.890" style="s2">hasn&#39;t even been addressed like there</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.950" end="00:57:41.600" style="s2">there are there are issues with some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.890" end="00:57:45.560" style="s2">the appropriation that are on the pain</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.600" end="00:57:48.650" style="s2">side so I I know I went off topic a</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.560" end="00:57:51.890" style="s2">little bit but I don&#39;t think that this</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.650" end="00:57:54.829" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the signaling I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.890" end="00:57:57.079" style="s2">that&#39;s actually an abstraction layer to</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.829" end="00:58:00.140" style="s2">make larger cultures cohere that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.079" end="00:58:01.369" style="s2">tribalism now if by tribalism what you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.140" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">really meant was in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.369" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">behavior i guess everybody did</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:10.730" style="s2">but beyond the Dunbar number now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">a different question are humans so</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.730" end="00:58:14.539" style="s2">arguments capable of moving beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.559" end="00:58:16.039" style="s2">Dumber number obviously right like being</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.539" end="00:58:19.130" style="s2">able to have some sense of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.039" end="00:58:21.109" style="s2">with abstracted people well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.130" end="00:58:25.010" style="s2">what nations and religions and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.109" end="00:58:27.859" style="s2">been and they&#39;ve had they&#39;ve mostly only</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.010" end="00:58:33.950" style="s2">been able to do it through hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.859" end="00:58:35.839" style="s2">systems that where the there was loss of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.950" end="00:58:39.309" style="s2">freedom of individuals within those</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.839" end="00:58:42.289" style="s2">systems to maintain coherence now</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.309" end="00:58:43.789" style="s2">Machiavelli you knows enemy hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.289" end="00:58:46.579" style="s2">said that the only way to get a group of</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.789" end="00:58:48.049" style="s2">people to cohere sustainably beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.579" end="00:58:50.900" style="s2">Dunbar number is if they have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.049" end="00:58:54.170" style="s2">outside threat that is a bigger threat</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.900" end="00:58:58.460" style="s2">than their reason to not cohere with</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.170" end="00:59:01.190" style="s2">each other that has been true for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.460" end="00:59:04.730" style="s2">most part right like we&#39;ve we you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.190" end="00:59:08.539" style="s2">get you can have infighting between</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.730" end="00:59:12.710" style="s2">Shiite and Sunni until they have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.539" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">West as a big enough you know shared foe</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.710" end="00:59:19.640" style="s2">that they can actually unify against</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:22.279" style="s2">that that&#39;s been true I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.640" end="00:59:23.690" style="s2">dynamic that&#39;s about to happen that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.279" end="00:59:25.460" style="s2">different than anything that has ever</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.690" end="00:59:27.650" style="s2">happened and I think so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.460" end="00:59:31.309" style="s2">actually an important piece of changing</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.650" end="00:59:33.829" style="s2">social science axioms for a minute so</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.309" end="00:59:36.650" style="s2">how do you get the whole how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.829" end="00:59:40.010" style="s2">everyone on this little spaceship</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.650" end="00:59:42.440" style="s2">biosphere to recognize that they are all</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.010" end="00:59:44.539" style="s2">inside of the same spaceship biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.440" end="00:59:45.950" style="s2">and now we&#39;re affecting things at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.539" end="00:59:48.410" style="s2">level of the whole fucking biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.950" end="00:59:50.720" style="s2">right it&#39;s like climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.410" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">biodiversity loss and like all those</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.720" end="00:59:54.380" style="s2">issues and if we have catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:56.990" style="s2">threats from the way we develop</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.380" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">exponential tech like AI or nanotech or</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.990" end="01:00:01.400" style="s2">like these are not local issues so they</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:02.180" style="s2">cool governance doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.400" end="01:00:05.180" style="s2">if we&#39;re effect</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.180" end="01:00:08.510" style="s2">each other completely like a China and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.180" end="01:00:10.340" style="s2">India in the US can&#39;t can&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.510" end="01:00:12.320" style="s2">climate change as countries in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.340" end="01:00:15.140" style="s2">meaningful you know sentence without</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.320" end="01:00:16.520" style="s2">what each other are doing so how do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.140" end="01:00:19.400" style="s2">get that to happen well either you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.520" end="01:00:21.170" style="s2">got to have some aliens attack so we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.400" end="01:00:23.510" style="s2">all unify against the common enemy</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.170" end="01:00:25.430" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to abstract the enemy and say</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.510" end="01:00:27.590" style="s2">climate change is the enemy we all need</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.430" end="01:00:29.780" style="s2">to unify to keep ourselves from going</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.590" end="01:00:32.660" style="s2">extinct as a species or AI is the enemy</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.780" end="01:00:38.900" style="s2">or whatever the fuck we decide or you</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.660" end="01:00:40.700" style="s2">can actually unify you so the first part</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.900" end="01:00:42.590" style="s2">is you can unify against an abstract</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.700" end="01:00:44.710" style="s2">threat right it does not have to be an</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.590" end="01:00:47.170" style="s2">agent ik threat so something like</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.710" end="01:00:49.550" style="s2">environmental destruction or</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.170" end="01:00:51.710" style="s2">catastrophic risk of any kind could be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.550" end="01:00:53.780" style="s2">unifying imperative it&#39;s harder but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.710" end="01:00:56.780" style="s2">possible but the next thing is we also</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.780" end="01:00:58.790" style="s2">can unify towards shared goals where it</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.780" end="01:01:01.730" style="s2">is more useful for us to do that than</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.790" end="01:01:02.870" style="s2">not and this is a important thing and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.730" end="01:01:07.130" style="s2">think right now we have a situation</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.870" end="01:01:11.930" style="s2">where if we continue in group out group</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.130" end="01:01:14.900" style="s2">dynamics there is no way to not move</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.930" end="01:01:18.130" style="s2">into catastrophic and even existential</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.900" end="01:01:21.410" style="s2">risk zone and so we absolutely do have</p>

<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:34.130" style="s2">to all of us are only realizable that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.320" end="01:01:35.830" style="s2">way why do I say this if we think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.130" end="01:01:39.470" style="s2">it from a game theoretic perspective</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.830" end="01:01:42.380" style="s2">those early tribes would cohere with</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.470" end="01:01:44.300" style="s2">each other as a team to then if when</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.380" end="01:01:48.050" style="s2">they needed to compete against other</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.300" end="01:01:49.790" style="s2">tribes in a win-lose game model and they</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.050" end="01:01:53.180" style="s2">would compete either for resource</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.790" end="01:01:55.790" style="s2">extraction of scarce resources or direct</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.180" end="01:01:58.520" style="s2">head-on competition through war right</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.790" end="01:02:00.260" style="s2">through military complex and if there</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.520" end="01:02:01.640" style="s2">was enough abundance of resources and</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.260" end="01:02:03.650" style="s2">materials that it was easier to take</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.640" end="01:02:04.880" style="s2">shit from nature from the Commons and</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.650" end="01:02:06.320" style="s2">fight each other then they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.880" end="01:02:08.830" style="s2">fight if the there started to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.320" end="01:02:11.170" style="s2">scarcity and fighting each other be</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.830" end="01:02:13.700" style="s2">directly or indirectly became a</p>

<p begin="01:02:13.700" end="01:02:15.859" style="s2">that happened and then of course if</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.530" end="01:02:22.009" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.859" end="01:02:23.599" style="s2">larger tribe and we can&#39;t actually fight</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.009" end="01:02:25.220" style="s2">them competently then we might unify</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.599" end="01:02:26.749" style="s2">with some other smaller tribes but then</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.220" end="01:02:28.999" style="s2">now we&#39;re bigger that&#39;s gonna have them</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.749" end="01:02:30.739" style="s2">do it now we&#39;re at villages and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.999" end="01:02:33.049" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna keep unifying and creating</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.739" end="01:02:36.220" style="s2">better now we need signalling systems</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.049" end="01:02:39.259" style="s2">right now we need culture larger and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.220" end="01:02:42.440" style="s2">will eventually get nation-states and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.259" end="01:02:44.359" style="s2">economic trading blocks but as as we</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.440" end="01:02:47.119" style="s2">think about this kind of what we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:03:11.450" end="01:03:15.380" style="s2">that start to collapse Grid</p>

<p begin="01:03:36.279" end="01:03:42.200" style="s2">right like are they china and russia in</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.009" end="01:03:44.509" style="s2">the u.s. like we just can&#39;t get into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.200" end="01:03:46.369" style="s2">war with each other so we will try and</p>

<p begin="01:03:46.369" end="01:03:53.480" style="s2">but we have weapons that are powerful</p>

<p begin="01:06:57.559" end="01:07:03.589" style="s2">finite and infinite games yep James</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.440" end="01:07:06.349" style="s2">course yeah it&#39;s a great read for those</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.589" end="01:07:08.180" style="s2">who haven&#39;t read it there&#39;s he outlines</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.349" end="01:07:10.819" style="s2">a perspective on essentially everything</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.180" end="01:07:13.039" style="s2">in human life where we can see it as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.819" end="01:07:15.380" style="s2">game and a finite game there&#39;s winners</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.039" end="01:07:17.749" style="s2">and losers and a clear outcome and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.380" end="01:07:19.519" style="s2">it&#39;s finite it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.749" end="01:07:22.369" style="s2">something you could repeat it you could</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.519" end="01:07:24.890" style="s2">do multiple times in the series but each</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.369" end="01:07:27.349" style="s2">outcome is kind of set whereas the point</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.890" end="01:07:31.130" style="s2">of an infinite game is to keep playing</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.349" end="01:07:33.019" style="s2">so like a relationship or we would say</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.130" end="01:07:35.390" style="s2">the human species if this is the game</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.019" end="01:07:37.219" style="s2">we&#39;re playing what we want to do is not</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.390" end="01:07:38.869" style="s2">to have winners and losers but to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.219" end="01:07:43.269" style="s2">able to enable the game to continue</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.869" end="01:07:45.739" style="s2">rolling along and yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.269" end="01:07:47.329" style="s2">foundational book and I highly recommend</p>

<p begin="01:07:47.329" end="01:07:51.710" style="s2">layers of depth and meaning built in</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.579" end="01:07:53.960" style="s2">that if you&#39;re if you&#39;re reading it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.710" end="01:07:56.809" style="s2">a treatise on economics and governance</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.960" end="01:08:00.109" style="s2">and spirituality and human psychology at</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.809" end="01:08:02.479" style="s2">the same time but that core idea that</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.109" end="01:08:05.680" style="s2">finite games are meant to be won and</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.479" end="01:08:08.509" style="s2">when you win the game&#39;s over and</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.680" end="01:08:12.650" style="s2">infinite games are meant to continue the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.509" end="01:08:14.479" style="s2">game of play it&#39;s a it is a so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.650" end="01:08:17.569" style="s2">looking at a shift from win-lose game</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.479" end="01:08:19.819" style="s2">theory to Omni win-win or a different</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.569" end="01:08:23.569" style="s2">concept even of what win means from</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.819" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">mostly zero-sum to increasingly positive</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.569" end="01:08:27.710" style="s2">some from finite to infinite there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:29.869" style="s2">whole shift but that new thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.710" end="01:08:32.540" style="s2">even anything like what we have called a</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.869" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">game previously yeah and if and if to</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.540" end="01:08:36.949" style="s2">win is to play then this brings us to a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:38.750" style="s2">couple of points of ideas that people</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.949" end="01:08:40.460" style="s2">have talked about I know you talked</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.750" end="01:08:42.980" style="s2">about the Commons as a key reference</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.460" end="01:08:45.619" style="s2">point in your work where things that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.980" end="01:08:46.880" style="s2">common like the common resources or the</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.619" end="01:08:49.790" style="s2">the things that are common to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.880" end="01:08:51.830" style="s2">like the environment but then we face</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.790" end="01:08:54.380" style="s2">the problem of say hardly anybody who</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.830" end="01:08:55.069" style="s2">uses Wikipedia actually contributes to</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.380" end="01:08:56.930" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.069" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">and how can we change that perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.930" end="01:09:01.220" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another obvious example</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:03.230" style="s2">which is the idea of a universal basic</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.220" end="01:09:07.069" style="s2">income which would enable people to keep</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.230" end="01:09:08.630" style="s2">playing their lives without feeling that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.069" end="01:09:10.430" style="s2">if they they don&#39;t do certain things</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.630" end="01:09:12.950" style="s2">they&#39;re simply not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.430" end="01:09:15.410" style="s2">play at all and I wonder if you could</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.950" end="01:09:18.049" style="s2">comment on the usual objections that</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.410" end="01:09:20.210" style="s2">come up against those which tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.049" end="01:09:22.330" style="s2">people are selfish and they don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.210" end="01:09:24.859" style="s2">about others how can we reconfigure AI</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.330" end="01:09:29.089" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas of what the game is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.859" end="01:09:33.980" style="s2">they&#39;re playing yeah so you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.089" end="01:09:36.109" style="s2">questions that to really deconstruct a</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.980" end="01:09:38.780" style="s2">lot of our ideas around evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.109" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">biology and evolutionary psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.780" end="01:09:45.080" style="s2">what we think of as human nature</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:46.850" style="s2">genetically and economic theory and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.080" end="01:09:49.160" style="s2">adequately reconstruct new things would</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.850" end="01:09:51.350" style="s2">take enough time that I&#39;m not gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.160" end="01:09:56.660" style="s2">to do it I&#39;m gonna just push push</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.350" end="01:09:59.900" style="s2">buttons of all of those I think that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.660" end="01:10:02.510" style="s2">have got human conditioning that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.900" end="01:10:04.310" style="s2">actually relatively new but that has</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.510" end="01:10:05.990" style="s2">become very ubiquitous because it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.310" end="01:10:07.670" style="s2">successful in a win-lose game theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.990" end="01:10:09.440" style="s2">structure and it&#39;s so skubick with us</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.670" end="01:10:12.020" style="s2">that we&#39;ve done pretty much all of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.440" end="01:10:13.700" style="s2">social science within that context and</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.020" end="01:10:16.430" style="s2">so we stopped factoring the context and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.700" end="01:10:19.220" style="s2">call it human nature we we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.430" end="01:10:21.890" style="s2">almost all of our social sciences within</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.220" end="01:10:24.260" style="s2">capitalism we&#39;ve done almost all of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.890" end="01:10:26.570" style="s2">within nation-states right within those</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.260" end="01:10:30.110" style="s2">kinds of structures done it within win</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.570" end="01:10:32.030" style="s2">lose game theory in a mostly</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.110" end="01:10:33.740" style="s2">post-industrial definitely post agrarian</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.030" end="01:10:37.220" style="s2">world most the history of our species</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.740" end="01:10:38.960" style="s2">was pre agrarian definitely pre nation</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.220" end="01:10:41.810" style="s2">say and you know pre agrarian also meant</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.960" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">pre capital pre private ownership of</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.810" end="01:10:45.560" style="s2">surplus because there was no fucking</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:47.000" style="s2">surplus and so there&#39;s a totally</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.560" end="01:10:51.230" style="s2">different relationship to those things</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.000" end="01:10:52.880" style="s2">so uh and then we say okay well the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.230" end="01:10:55.250" style="s2">that we&#39;re behaving since it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:56.840" style="s2">ubiquitous must be nature rather than</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.250" end="01:10:58.610" style="s2">nurture so then let&#39;s try and look for</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.840" end="01:11:00.440" style="s2">the genes that correlate and make it a</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.610" end="01:11:07.750" style="s2">genetic answer and this is where I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.440" end="01:11:07.750" style="s2">our our biases lead to bad science</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.040" end="01:11:13.330" style="s2">so I won&#39;t go further down there but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.110" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">will say that most of what we call in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.330" end="01:11:20.260" style="s2">Leah Boleyn is our nature expressed</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:23.770" style="s2">through a certain set of conditions and</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.260" end="01:11:25.720" style="s2">different enough conditions can can have</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.770" end="01:11:28.480" style="s2">what is nature expressed differently now</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.720" end="01:11:31.030" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna come back and say the whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.480" end="01:11:32.530" style="s2">nature-nurture what is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.030" end="01:11:35.350" style="s2">possible to the human condition</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.530" end="01:11:36.790" style="s2">it we can ask a thought experiment about</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.350" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">it that&#39;s different than we&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.790" end="01:11:41.920" style="s2">to ask previously because CRISPR is</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.360" end="01:11:44.730" style="s2">making the conversation of human genetic</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.920" end="01:11:48.460" style="s2">engineering a real not that far off</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.730" end="01:11:50.830" style="s2">possible conversation right it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.460" end="01:11:53.560" style="s2">fucking deal because if we say ok well</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.830" end="01:11:56.980" style="s2">maybe maybe there is something that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.560" end="01:12:00.190" style="s2">genetic and maybe we can change those</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.980" end="01:12:03.360" style="s2">genes then it brings up D instantly now</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.190" end="01:12:05.710" style="s2">we&#39;re in deep existentialism around oh</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:07.180" style="s2">if we can actually change something that</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.710" end="01:12:09.700" style="s2">we thought of as nature what is</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.180" end="01:12:13.170" style="s2">fundamentally desirable outside of what</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.700" end="01:12:15.730" style="s2">we thought was a fixed context right</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.170" end="01:12:16.930" style="s2">should do we want to then change the</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.730" end="01:12:20.650" style="s2">genes where everyone is a hyper</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.930" end="01:12:22.600" style="s2">competitor do we and and they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.650" end="01:12:25.150" style="s2">most violent and largest alpha men</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.600" end="01:12:26.590" style="s2">possible only do we want to make it</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.150" end="01:12:28.120" style="s2">toward now alphas are irrelevant and</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.590" end="01:12:29.200" style="s2">everyone is a super cooperator do we</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.120" end="01:12:32.530" style="s2">want to make it to where people are</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.200" end="01:12:34.060" style="s2">happy all the time and we have done the</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.530" end="01:12:36.310" style="s2">abolitionist imperative and got rid of</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.060" end="01:12:39.610" style="s2">the ability to suffer and feel pain or</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.310" end="01:12:41.320" style="s2">do we like are there evolutionary and</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.610" end="01:12:43.930" style="s2">psychological purposes that stay</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.320" end="01:12:46.570" style="s2">relevant to like now we&#39;re in a very</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.930" end="01:12:48.430" style="s2">deep existential philosophic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.570" end="01:12:50.590" style="s2">important that we go there now as soon</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.430" end="01:12:52.270" style="s2">as we can start to you know ask those</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.590" end="01:12:53.350" style="s2">questions then we can come back to ok</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.270" end="01:12:54.540" style="s2">well here are some things that are</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.350" end="01:12:57.130" style="s2">meaningful about the human condition</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.540" end="01:12:59.290" style="s2">what of them might actually be possible</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.130" end="01:13:00.940" style="s2">even without the genetic engineering but</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.290" end="01:13:02.980" style="s2">it does make us start thinking that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.940" end="01:13:05.710" style="s2">what we have thought of as human nature</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.980" end="01:13:08.200" style="s2">that was a hard unfixed limit we can at</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.710" end="01:13:11.850" style="s2">least think about it more flexibly which</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.200" end="01:13:11.850" style="s2">i think is a useful thought experiment</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.150" end="01:13:15.150" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.590" end="01:13:23.000" style="s2">if you have us if you have a situation</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.780" end="01:13:26.690" style="s2">where there&#39;s a lot of shitty jobs right</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.000" end="01:13:32.180" style="s2">like tarring roads is just not that fun</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.690" end="01:13:35.330" style="s2">and you know etc etc so it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.180" end="01:13:37.310" style="s2">that nobody would would never want to go</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.330" end="01:13:38.900" style="s2">do some touring of a road or different</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.310" end="01:13:40.640" style="s2">kinds of labor or different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.900" end="01:13:42.830" style="s2">rote tasks but most people wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.640" end="01:13:46.070" style="s2">to do 50 hours of it a week for 40 years</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.830" end="01:13:48.110" style="s2">right yeah and yet the society has</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.070" end="01:13:52.010" style="s2">needed people to do a bunch of that shit</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.110" end="01:13:55.100" style="s2">and so when you then see people as the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.010" end="01:13:57.740" style="s2">vector for getting societal things done</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.100" end="01:14:00.050" style="s2">you have to have an extrinsic motives</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.740" end="01:14:01.850" style="s2">system to get people to do it so if we</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.050" end="01:14:03.710" style="s2">all pull our resources and then make</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.850" end="01:14:06.470" style="s2">sure everybody has resources we call it</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.710" end="01:14:07.790" style="s2">communism then then why would anyone do</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.470" end="01:14:09.830" style="s2">the shitty jobs well now the state has</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.790" end="01:14:12.250" style="s2">to force them so we call it imperialism</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.830" end="01:14:14.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t like communism</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.250" end="01:14:15.980" style="s2">I&#39;m radically oversimplifying of course</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.930" end="01:14:18.140" style="s2">but that&#39;s like at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.980" end="01:14:19.640" style="s2">argument so then we say cool let&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.140" end="01:14:22.280" style="s2">the free market force people because</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.640" end="01:14:24.200" style="s2">that&#39;s better so we&#39;re the states not</p>

<p begin="01:15:31.370" end="01:15:33.680" style="s2">it like a</p>

<p begin="01:15:35.210" end="01:15:39.739" style="s2">can&#39;t use it and so because you</p>

<p begin="01:15:39.739" end="01:15:44.060" style="s2">enough of for everybody means that I</p>

<p begin="01:15:45.860" end="01:15:52.400" style="s2">right and if there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.630" end="01:15:54.500" style="s2">abundant enough that you having it</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.400" end="01:15:56.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t decrease my access at all like</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.500" end="01:15:57.890" style="s2">air we put no economic value at all on</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.510" end="01:16:00.140" style="s2">it because there&#39;s no ability to have</p>

<p begin="01:16:03.980" end="01:16:06.980" style="s2">air will pollute the shit out of it and</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.600" end="01:16:10.790" style="s2">burn it up because it doesn&#39;t enter our</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.980" end="01:16:13.790" style="s2">economics calculus is the basis of our</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.790" end="01:16:15.590" style="s2">decision-making but we&#39;ll work really</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.790" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">hard to get the gold or the diamond or</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.590" end="01:16:18.050" style="s2">whatever it is that we perceive as</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:19.670" style="s2">scarce nuff said if I have it gives me</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.050" end="01:16:21.410" style="s2">some differential advantage over you but</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.670" end="01:16:22.910" style="s2">then I&#39;m gonna take that gold of them in</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.410" end="01:16:24.530" style="s2">and put it in a safe that is doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.910" end="01:16:28.430" style="s2">nothing for anyone other than a Fiat</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.530" end="01:16:30.350" style="s2">purpose right and then because it scarce</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.430" end="01:16:31.820" style="s2">know this is important to get because</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.350" end="01:16:32.900" style="s2">the value is proportional to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.820" end="01:16:34.600" style="s2">scarcity because we&#39;re not looking for</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.900" end="01:16:36.620" style="s2">systemic advantage we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.600" end="01:16:38.450" style="s2">differential competitive advantage which</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.620" end="01:16:40.250" style="s2">just assumed if the thing became</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.450" end="01:16:42.320" style="s2">unscared so it would have no value like</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.250" end="01:16:43.670" style="s2">air so as soon as we start finding that</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.320" end="01:16:45.200" style="s2">diamonds aren&#39;t as scarce as we thought</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.670" end="01:16:47.000" style="s2">they were we start burning and crushing</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.200" end="01:16:51.350" style="s2">and hiding them right you know we need</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.000" end="01:16:54.980" style="s2">to artificially manufacture scarcity so</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.350" end="01:16:57.440" style="s2">when you have a system where if you</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.980" end="01:16:59.540" style="s2">don&#39;t get shit you die and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.440" end="01:17:01.310" style="s2">get more shit you don&#39;t get to express</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.540" end="01:17:03.739" style="s2">very well and anyone else getting shit</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.310" end="01:17:06.260" style="s2">means you don&#39;t have it and win-lose</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.739" end="01:17:08.000" style="s2">dynamics everywhere like if you if I</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.260" end="01:17:09.890" style="s2">wanted to condition greed and</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.000" end="01:17:11.989" style="s2">selfishness and jealousy and the people</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.890" end="01:17:13.730" style="s2">the best I could</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.989" end="01:17:17.719" style="s2">that&#39;s how the fuck I would do it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.730" end="01:17:19.910" style="s2">that you trading that exactly and if I</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.719" end="01:17:23.960" style="s2">wanted to train people to be Psychopaths</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.910" end="01:17:26.090" style="s2">right not like I put them through enough</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.960" end="01:17:27.739" style="s2">first person childhood trauma or they</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.090" end="01:17:30.290" style="s2">have the right kind of brain injuries or</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.739" end="01:17:32.000" style="s2">genes for formal psychopathy but I want</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.290" end="01:17:33.469" style="s2">to decrease their empathy pretty</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.000" end="01:17:36.350" style="s2">radically and their ability to</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.469" end="01:17:41.540" style="s2">rationalize harm well I would do things</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.350" end="01:17:43.400" style="s2">like capitalism and large you know and</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.540" end="01:17:45.409" style="s2">then the evolutions of capitalism that</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.400" end="01:17:49.489" style="s2">happen corporate capitalism where</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.409" end="01:17:50.659" style="s2">if you aren&#39;t willing to participate in</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.489" end="01:17:52.370" style="s2">something that&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.659" end="01:17:55.400" style="s2">externalities you just don&#39;t get to run</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.370" end="01:17:57.320" style="s2">a big company if you&#39;re running a big</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.400" end="01:18:00.500" style="s2">company you&#39;ve got to say yeah shit well</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.320" end="01:18:02.900" style="s2">those mines are run by slave labor but</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.500" end="01:18:04.489" style="s2">like there&#39;s just no other mines and if</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.900" end="01:18:06.409" style="s2">we tried to pay for fair trade we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.489" end="01:18:07.730" style="s2">totally out of business so you got it</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.409" end="01:18:09.980" style="s2">like crack some eggs to make some</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.730" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">omelets just even being able to</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.980" end="01:18:15.770" style="s2">participate with a system that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:19.000" style="s2">closed-loop that doesn&#39;t actually value</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.770" end="01:18:22.520" style="s2">all the metrics that it effects requires</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.000" end="01:18:24.800" style="s2">rationalizing harm and having a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.520" end="01:18:27.310" style="s2">abstracted psychopathy so you know we</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.800" end="01:18:29.719" style="s2">have a system that you can think of as</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.310" end="01:18:33.290" style="s2">conditioning low-grade whoo Bick wit a</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.719" end="01:18:34.820" style="s2">psychopathy and everybody and then we do</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.290" end="01:18:39.679" style="s2">social science on it we call it human</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.820" end="01:18:41.449" style="s2">nature yeah and then we can&#39;t change it</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.679" end="01:18:44.540" style="s2">then we&#39;d use that to rationalize the</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.449" end="01:18:46.580" style="s2">system again continuing it exactly but</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.540" end="01:18:50.630" style="s2">like you know if I walk by a homeless</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.580" end="01:18:53.659" style="s2">person and they have they&#39;re in real</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.630" end="01:18:56.409" style="s2">pain right they might even be bleeding</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.659" end="01:18:59.389" style="s2">they might be really dirty they and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.409" end="01:19:02.090" style="s2">just walk by because I&#39;m busy I got shit</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.389" end="01:19:05.389" style="s2">to do and maybe I give him five bucks</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.090" end="01:19:08.750" style="s2">but I you know I walk by there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.389" end="01:19:11.210" style="s2">something wrong with me at a human level</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.750" end="01:19:14.449" style="s2">there is some way that I was able to</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.210" end="01:19:16.159" style="s2">turn my empathy off where this</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.449" end="01:19:18.650" style="s2">disappointment I got to get to that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.159" end="01:19:21.710" style="s2">trivial as fuck in comparison to this</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.650" end="01:19:24.020" style="s2">other person&#39;s whole life I just I can</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.710" end="01:19:26.060" style="s2">and I can be fine just continuing to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.020" end="01:19:27.380" style="s2">worried about my busyness like what the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.060" end="01:19:29.000" style="s2">fuck how could I do that</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.380" end="01:19:30.770" style="s2">well because there&#39;s so many homeless</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.000" end="01:19:34.940" style="s2">people I can&#39;t fix all of them and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.770" end="01:19:38.600" style="s2">that then that rationalizes none of them</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.940" end="01:19:41.659" style="s2">right but that&#39;s that systemic that is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.600" end="01:19:44.060" style="s2">system where empathy isn&#39;t even viable</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.659" end="01:19:47.060" style="s2">in the system and so everybody has to</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.060" end="01:19:49.159" style="s2">turn it down or go crazy yeah it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.060" end="01:19:50.360" style="s2">like a personal if I don&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.159" end="01:19:52.070" style="s2">language makes sense but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.360" end="01:19:54.080" style="s2">personally systemic thing that if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.070" end="01:19:55.230" style="s2">think you can&#39;t help all the people then</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.080" end="01:19:59.989" style="s2">you won&#39;t help one</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.230" end="01:20:04.310" style="s2">then you never helped anybody yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.989" end="01:20:07.200" style="s2">so well you know cuz it doesn&#39;t you say</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.310" end="01:20:09.600" style="s2">alright I can try and do this like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.200" end="01:20:12.450" style="s2">help this one thing but then if I&#39;m if I</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.600" end="01:20:15.320" style="s2">care about this one enough to really</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.450" end="01:20:18.239" style="s2">help them I turn my feeling back on</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.320" end="01:20:20.580" style="s2">rights then you on the day my feeling</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.239" end="01:20:22.290" style="s2">back on now what about the next one and</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.580" end="01:20:25.489" style="s2">the next one and when do I stop but also</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.290" end="01:20:28.440" style="s2">and when do I decide that actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.489" end="01:20:30.120" style="s2">upgrading from my last year&#39;s Mercedes</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.440" end="01:20:33.440" style="s2">to this next year&#39;s Mercedes is worth</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.120" end="01:20:36.989" style="s2">more than helping a couple more of them</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.440" end="01:20:40.530" style="s2">how are you gonna say my time well in</p>

<p begin="01:20:43.050" end="01:20:48.330" style="s2">you help them but you also start risking</p>

<p begin="01:20:48.330" end="01:20:52.880" style="s2">you you really want to help them you</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.060" end="01:20:56.850" style="s2">want to give them all the resources and</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.880" end="01:20:59.190" style="s2">you already have you yourself living</p>

<p begin="01:20:59.190" end="01:21:02.450" style="s2">you have to take care of your own shit</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.750" end="01:21:05.220" style="s2">first before you can help anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.450" end="01:21:08.880" style="s2">well that&#39;s the story right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.220" end="01:21:12.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the story that we tell and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.880" end="01:21:14.820" style="s2">of course now this is a very painful</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.420" end="01:21:17.820" style="s2">thing to say but most people then if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.820" end="01:21:20.040" style="s2">look at at the end of their life the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.820" end="01:21:22.680" style="s2">amount of shit that they&#39;ve consumed and</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.040" end="01:21:24.330" style="s2">what that did to the environment what it</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.680" end="01:21:26.550" style="s2">did to however many animals that were</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.330" end="01:21:28.800" style="s2">involved how many species went extinct</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.550" end="01:21:30.900" style="s2">related to those supply chains how many</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.800" end="01:21:32.940" style="s2">animals in factory farms and then how</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.900" end="01:21:35.970" style="s2">many migrant workers how many people in</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.940" end="01:21:37.470" style="s2">sweat shops etc and you and you look at</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.970" end="01:21:40.560" style="s2">all of that and then you compare it to</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.470" end="01:21:41.940" style="s2">what that person then did once they got</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.560" end="01:21:44.430" style="s2">ahead well enough to help other people</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.940" end="01:21:48.480" style="s2">like there they are on the liability</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.430" end="01:21:50.580" style="s2">side of nature&#39;s balance sheet yes now</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.480" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">the answer is not obvious because the</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.580" end="01:21:54.090" style="s2">answer doesn&#39;t exist within this system</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:57.630" style="s2">the answer is actually needing to build</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.090" end="01:21:59.610" style="s2">new systems that don&#39;t take complexity</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.630" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">and make it simple or complicated right</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.610" end="01:22:03.989" style="s2">that don&#39;t do win-lose game-theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:06.780" style="s2">structures so when when you look at this</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.989" end="01:22:08.019" style="s2">it is it&#39;s actually there aren&#39;t obvious</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.780" end="01:22:10.210" style="s2">answers the</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.019" end="01:22:13.480" style="s2">good and meaningful about how to like</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.210" end="01:22:15.039" style="s2">okay how do we prevent war and have a</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.480" end="01:22:16.210" style="s2">world full of peace like why the fuck do</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.039" end="01:22:17.760" style="s2">we still have war it would seem like</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.210" end="01:22:22.659" style="s2">world peace is something everybody wants</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.760" end="01:22:24.999" style="s2">okay well how do you have a for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.659" end="01:22:28.230" style="s2">military-industrial complex as the</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.999" end="01:22:29.980" style="s2">largest block of global economics and</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.230" end="01:22:31.480" style="s2">understanding the laws of supply and</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.980" end="01:22:33.280" style="s2">demand have a world that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.480" end="01:22:36.999" style="s2">war like how do those two things get to</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.280" end="01:22:42.639" style="s2">live together they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.999" end="01:22:44.469" style="s2">right and so then when we say well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.639" end="01:22:45.579" style="s2">working on peace are you working to</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.469" end="01:22:47.230" style="s2">obsolete having a for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.579" end="01:22:51.159" style="s2">military-industrial complex cuz if not</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.230" end="01:22:53.800" style="s2">you have no chance of addressing it</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.159" end="01:22:56.380" style="s2">because any system of supply has to</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.800" end="01:22:58.539" style="s2">continue to maintain and protect and</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.380" end="01:23:00.940" style="s2">grow its source of demand and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.539" end="01:23:03.429" style="s2">even just the directors following their</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.940" end="01:23:04.869" style="s2">fiduciary responsibility to the</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.429" end="01:23:08.019" style="s2">shareholders of the company I mean like</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.869" end="01:23:10.349" style="s2">that so the point is it&#39;s a the system</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.019" end="01:23:10.349" style="s2">as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.769" end="01:23:16.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a paperclip Maximizer and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.980" end="01:23:19.809" style="s2">there&#39;s an identity problem here at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.690" end="01:23:21.369" style="s2">core to you that if you&#39;re trying to say</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.809" end="01:23:24.070" style="s2">obsolete a military-industrial complex</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.369" end="01:23:26.139" style="s2">the people within it don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.070" end="01:23:27.900" style="s2">obsoleted but in the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.139" end="01:23:30.219" style="s2">somebody who has spent their whole life</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.900" end="01:23:32.499" style="s2">tearing the roads and that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.219" end="01:23:34.900" style="s2">skill they feel they have they also</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.499" end="01:23:37.059" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be obsoleted because</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.900" end="01:23:39.219" style="s2">there&#39;s that sense of existential</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.059" end="01:23:41.019" style="s2">confusion and angst over well well what</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.219" end="01:23:43.090" style="s2">am i then I&#39;m being forced to become</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.019" end="01:23:45.820" style="s2">something else and that&#39;s frightening</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.090" end="01:23:48.670" style="s2">right right so the shift that has to</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.820" end="01:23:50.949" style="s2">happen does include a macro structural</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.670" end="01:23:54.219" style="s2">shift but it also includes individual</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.949" end="01:23:56.499" style="s2">both trauma and attachments level shifts</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.219" end="01:23:58.869" style="s2">and identity level shifts right because</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.499" end="01:24:00.849" style="s2">most people&#39;s identity like that not</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.869" end="01:24:03.340" style="s2">most people everybody&#39;s identity was</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.849" end="01:24:05.289" style="s2">conditioned by a system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.340" end="01:24:08.559" style="s2">adaptive within it and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.289" end="01:24:11.139" style="s2">maladaptive to making something else and</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.559" end="01:24:12.730" style="s2">then I guess we come back to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.139" end="01:24:15.639" style="s2">question of still wanting to have</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.730" end="01:24:17.469" style="s2">control over your life and how things</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.639" end="01:24:21.280" style="s2">make sense but if we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.469" end="01:24:23.170" style="s2">radical shift in human development</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.280" end="01:24:25.869" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve come to think of as</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.170" end="01:24:27.190" style="s2">human nature which you said likely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.869" end="01:24:29.139" style="s2">just something we call human nature</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.190" end="01:24:30.969" style="s2">because it&#39;s been the case for long</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.139" end="01:24:35.289" style="s2">enough that we think it&#39;s fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.969" end="01:24:38.770" style="s2">the we have to overhaul some very basic</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.289" end="01:24:40.960" style="s2">structures of thoughts here so looking</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.770" end="01:24:43.329" style="s2">looking forward at that process do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:45.340" style="s2">think this is we&#39;re a chrysalis about to</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.329" end="01:24:56.110" style="s2">turn into a butterfly or are you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.340" end="01:25:03.579" style="s2">more worried than that I think that if</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.110" end="01:25:05.349" style="s2">we just okay first I will say that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.579" end="01:25:14.230" style="s2">have what I might call kind of naive</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.349" end="01:25:19.599" style="s2">Tecna is Amaya there much of Silicon</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.230" end="01:25:22.539" style="s2">Valley is famous for right and that that</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.599" end="01:25:24.929" style="s2">narrative is also connected to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.539" end="01:25:28.780" style="s2">this that dialectic of progress that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.929" end="01:25:30.099" style="s2">used to have these short brutish nasty</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.780" end="01:25:32.770" style="s2">lives and should have just been getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.099" end="01:25:36.010" style="s2">continuously better with capitalism and</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.770" end="01:25:37.360" style="s2">tech and industry you know on a on a</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.010" end="01:25:39.760" style="s2">consistent path and it&#39;s gonna continue</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.360" end="01:25:41.050" style="s2">forever and every problem we have that</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.760" end="01:25:42.639" style="s2">ahead we don&#39;t really have to worry</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.050" end="01:25:44.380" style="s2">about because human ingenuity always</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.639" end="01:25:47.260" style="s2">figures it out</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.380" end="01:25:50.289" style="s2">I do think that this is radically naive</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.260" end="01:25:52.690" style="s2">i I think that is a more dangerous world</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.289" end="01:25:55.869" style="s2">view than fundamentalist religious</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.690" end="01:25:57.219" style="s2">worldviews interest because the</p>

<p begin="01:25:57.219" end="01:26:03.449" style="s2">can&#39;t create new tech that gives us more</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.860" end="01:26:05.860" style="s2">power and having more power</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.449" end="01:26:07.480" style="s2">exponentially more power to affect shit</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.860" end="01:26:09.280" style="s2">without having comprehensively better</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.480" end="01:26:13.630" style="s2">decision making means exponential</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.280" end="01:26:14.889" style="s2">externality equals catastrophic risk we</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.630" end="01:26:17.739" style="s2">have a scenario right now where</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.889" end="01:26:20.050" style="s2">exponential tech is means we are</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.739" end="01:26:21.880" style="s2">exponent we don&#39;t know how to make an</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.050" end="01:26:24.550" style="s2">intuition around exponents because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.880" end="01:26:26.889" style="s2">never had them right we we&#39;ve got we can</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.550" end="01:26:28.630" style="s2">maybe make a sense out of like curves</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.889" end="01:26:30.369" style="s2">that are slightly inflected up for a</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.630" end="01:26:33.550" style="s2">short period of time but not really</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.369" end="01:26:35.050" style="s2">right so with an exponential curve our</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.550" end="01:26:37.000" style="s2">intuition can&#39;t really make</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.050" end="01:26:38.920" style="s2">but we have exponentially increasing</p>

<p begin="01:26:38.920" end="01:26:51.250" style="s2">militarily and through supply chains and</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.639" end="01:26:52.630" style="s2">through extraction technology and there</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.250" end="01:26:55.150" style="s2">are positive applications because</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.630" end="01:26:57.760" style="s2">thermodynamics just works that way right</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.150" end="01:27:00.670" style="s2">like there there&#39;s one way to put all</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.760" end="01:27:02.380" style="s2">the pieces of a cell together where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.670" end="01:27:07.619" style="s2">a cell and it respirate s&#39; there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.380" end="01:27:11.500" style="s2">of fucking ways to take it apart and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.619" end="01:27:13.090" style="s2">and it takes a year to build a house or</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.500" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">six months but it takes a few minutes</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.090" end="01:27:16.599" style="s2">with a record ball to break it down</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:18.579" style="s2">entropy is just easier so when we</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.599" end="01:27:20.590" style="s2">develop new technological capacity that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.579" end="01:27:23.260" style="s2">negative applications have higher</p>

<p begin="01:27:23.260" end="01:27:28.119" style="s2">even playing field of probability so we</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.849" end="01:27:30.250" style="s2">have to factor that so if we&#39;re two</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.119" end="01:27:32.050" style="s2">things we&#39;re exponentially increasing</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.250" end="01:27:37.059" style="s2">our capacity to affect the world around</p>

<p begin="01:30:26.440" end="01:30:30.790" style="s2">does it look well if I just plot the</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.690" end="01:30:37.060" style="s2">current curves the current curves don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:30:51.610" end="01:30:56.770" style="s2">asked this question about caterpillar</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.640" end="01:30:59.230" style="s2">into a butterfly this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.770" end="01:31:00.400" style="s2">interesting question because if I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.230" end="01:31:01.900" style="s2">know the caterpillar was going to go</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.400" end="01:31:03.969" style="s2">into a chrysalis and do the butterfly</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.900" end="01:31:07.030" style="s2">and I was just watching the caterpillar</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.969" end="01:31:08.320" style="s2">grow and I was forecasting a curve I</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.030" end="01:31:09.670" style="s2">would assume that it just kept becoming</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.320" end="01:31:10.900" style="s2">a bigger and bigger caterpillar and</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.670" end="01:31:12.460" style="s2">eating more and more shit until it</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.900" end="01:31:13.239" style="s2">decimated all the plants and ate itself</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.460" end="01:31:17.860" style="s2">to extinction</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.239" end="01:31:19.390" style="s2">yeah and so I can&#39;t keep plotting that</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.860" end="01:31:20.800" style="s2">curve because it&#39;s not gonna do that</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.390" end="01:31:23.469" style="s2">curve it&#39;s gonna do that curve to a</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.800" end="01:31:26.590" style="s2">certain point where it&#39;s actually eaten</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.469" end="01:31:28.960" style="s2">enough stuff meaning the caterpillar is</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.590" end="01:31:30.730" style="s2">a net consumption machine right like it</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.960" end="01:31:32.409" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pollinate stuff all it does is</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.730" end="01:31:34.750" style="s2">devastate everything around it consuming</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.409" end="01:31:36.659" style="s2">but it&#39;s getting the raw materials the</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.750" end="01:31:39.880" style="s2">minerals amino acids to make a butterfly</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.659" end="01:31:41.469" style="s2">so but as this consumption machine it is</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.880" end="01:31:45.400" style="s2">devastating the environment around it</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.469" end="01:31:47.110" style="s2">but once it eats enough stuff that it</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.400" end="01:31:49.300" style="s2">has the fuel and resources necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.110" end="01:31:51.190" style="s2">make a butterfly the imaginal cells the</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.300" end="01:31:53.230" style="s2">first butterfly cells start kicking on</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.190" end="01:31:55.960" style="s2">triggers the movement into the chrysalis</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.230" end="01:31:58.420" style="s2">at which point the caterpillar ends up</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.960" end="01:32:01.530" style="s2">dissolving like all the organs is</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.420" end="01:32:05.949" style="s2">alright dissolves all the way down to</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.530" end="01:32:08.620" style="s2">sub cellular structures and then gets to</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.949" end="01:32:11.260" style="s2">reform right at an amino acid at a</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.620" end="01:32:13.420" style="s2">peptide level reform to a butterfly that</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.260" end="01:32:15.489" style="s2">is not a retrofit of a caterpillar it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.420" end="01:32:17.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamentally different thing of</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.489" end="01:32:19.630" style="s2">the fundamentally different code but you</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.560" end="01:32:22.390" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have predicted that discrete</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.630" end="01:32:24.630" style="s2">phase shift by just continuing to</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.390" end="01:32:26.800" style="s2">forecast along the caterpillar curve</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.630" end="01:32:30.159" style="s2">anymore than you would if you just took</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.800" end="01:32:32.890" style="s2">the 40 weeks of in utero development and</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.159" end="01:32:34.090" style="s2">said it looks bad right like if we</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.890" end="01:32:36.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t know birth was gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.090" end="01:32:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s getting really cramped around 42</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.790" end="01:32:40.420" style="s2">weeks around 44 weeks it looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.800" end="01:32:44.800" style="s2">just gonna like get too big and die</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.420" end="01:32:46.929" style="s2">right and this the same can be true said</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.800" end="01:32:49.090" style="s2">true for a little bird developing inside</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.929" end="01:32:51.760" style="s2">of an eggshell right like they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.090" end="01:32:54.880" style="s2">the developmental phases are defined by</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.760" end="01:32:58.239" style="s2">net consumption and net growth in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.880" end="01:32:59.770" style="s2">finite self terminating way to get to</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.239" end="01:33:02.469" style="s2">the point that of course if it tried to</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.770" end="01:33:03.909" style="s2">continue it would go it would die but</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.469" end="01:33:05.830" style="s2">it&#39;s to get to the point that it has the</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.909" end="01:33:09.340" style="s2">capacity to go through some discrete</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.830" end="01:33:10.630" style="s2">phase shift the chrysalis the birth out</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.340" end="01:33:12.190" style="s2">of the uterus and the cutting of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.630" end="01:33:15.159" style="s2">umbilical cord the emergence out of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.190" end="01:33:15.820" style="s2">eggshell and then on the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.159" end="01:33:18.990" style="s2">that discrete</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.820" end="01:33:22.600" style="s2">a ship is a totally new curve and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.990" end="01:33:24.970" style="s2">then the question is could there be a</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.600" end="01:33:27.070" style="s2">discrete phase shift that where all of</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.970" end="01:33:28.630" style="s2">what we&#39;ve called humanity or</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.070" end="01:33:31.060" style="s2">civilization so far has been a</p>

<p begin="01:33:33.790" end="01:33:37.780" style="s2">industrial complex all the civilization</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.710" end="01:33:41.500" style="s2">structures we&#39;re focused on gathering</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.780" end="01:33:44.260" style="s2">the parts necessary to build a truly</p>

<p begin="01:33:47.320" end="01:33:52.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be an extension of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.420" end="01:33:54.880" style="s2">current system it is a dissolve and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.680" end="01:33:57.150" style="s2">restructure those technologies those</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.880" end="01:34:01.360" style="s2">capacities for a fundamentally new</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.150" end="01:34:03.760" style="s2">reason for being and that is I would say</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.360" end="01:34:06.550" style="s2">the the hope and the possibility is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.760" end="01:34:09.190" style="s2">world where win lose game theory got us</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.550" end="01:34:11.250" style="s2">a lot of capacity to actually not just</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.190" end="01:34:13.990" style="s2">be a tribal people but a global people</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.250" end="01:34:16.090" style="s2">but now we actually have to transcend at</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.990" end="01:34:19.090" style="s2">the place where we&#39;ve gotten so much</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.090" end="01:34:21.010" style="s2">power to win that that power actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.090" end="01:34:23.050" style="s2">can&#39;t be used without destroying itself</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.010" end="01:34:26.020" style="s2">we have to now transcend win lose game</p>

<p begin="01:34:26.020" end="01:34:32.920" style="s2">I&#39;d say last question for this this part</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.780" end="01:34:35.320" style="s2">of discussion then are you optimistic</p>

<p begin="01:34:35.320" end="01:34:40.960" style="s2">be the chrysalis moment and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.320" end="01:34:42.760" style="s2">going to just be creating or turn into a</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.960" end="01:34:44.650" style="s2">new paradigm of some kind</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.760" end="01:34:53.500" style="s2">is there enough cause for hope that we</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.650" end="01:34:59.380" style="s2">could feel that way it&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.500" end="01:35:02.650" style="s2">question there there&#39;s a utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.380" end="01:35:05.470" style="s2">answer which is depending upon what is</p>

<p begin="01:35:13.390" end="01:35:18.280" style="s2">just wanting to win at a dying game then</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.270" end="01:35:20.290" style="s2">they might need to go through that and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.280" end="01:35:22.930" style="s2">think probably most people do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.290" end="01:35:25.570" style="s2">important but then not stay stuck there</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.930" end="01:35:26.620" style="s2">and then say okay well now I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.570" end="01:35:28.960" style="s2">to win at a dying</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.620" end="01:35:32.230" style="s2">or a game that is causing the death of</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.960" end="01:35:34.060" style="s2">what is meaningful itself I want to help</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.230" end="01:35:36.520" style="s2">birth a new game now what is what is</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.060" end="01:35:39.910" style="s2">that it&#39;s if you think of it as</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.520" end="01:35:42.280" style="s2">inevitable then it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.910" end="01:35:44.140" style="s2">compel your participation if you think</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.280" end="01:35:46.360" style="s2">of it as impossible it doesn&#39;t compel</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.140" end="01:35:49.360" style="s2">your participation either if you think</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.360" end="01:35:52.330" style="s2">of it as possible and not yet determined</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.360" end="01:35:53.260" style="s2">and influenceable by how you show up I</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.330" end="01:35:57.310" style="s2">think that&#39;s the right way to think</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.260" end="01:36:01.990" style="s2">about it so I have one last question in</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.310" end="01:36:06.700" style="s2">this regard what can we do then on an</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.990" end="01:36:14.440" style="s2">individual level to make this shift</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.700" end="01:36:21.580" style="s2">happen yeah so I&#39;m gonna answer that in</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.440" end="01:36:27.610" style="s2">a meta way first ask that question</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.580" end="01:36:29.890" style="s2">earnestly a lot and really work for</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.610" end="01:36:34.240" style="s2">answers without assuming that any</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.890" end="01:36:35.620" style="s2">authority already has them and not</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.240" end="01:36:36.820" style="s2">assuming that there aren&#39;t places that</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.620" end="01:36:40.120" style="s2">have a lot of answer that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.820" end="01:36:44.670" style="s2">study right but like for whatever faults</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.120" end="01:36:47.290" style="s2">we can assess there Gandhi did some very</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.670" end="01:36:49.330" style="s2">meaningful things that have have not</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.290" end="01:36:51.460" style="s2">been done at that scale maybe maybe ever</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.330" end="01:36:52.930" style="s2">and one of the interesting parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.460" end="01:36:54.190" style="s2">story when he said you know in South</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.930" end="01:36:55.630" style="s2">Africa the first time then in India</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.190" end="01:36:56.920" style="s2">later he said okay I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.630" end="01:36:59.200" style="s2">stop this I&#39;m gonna get a home rule for</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.920" end="01:37:01.260" style="s2">India and people said how he said I have</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.200" end="01:37:04.630" style="s2">no idea mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.260" end="01:37:07.000" style="s2">but he said like I know that it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.630" end="01:37:08.860" style="s2">I know that these people being enslaved</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.000" end="01:37:10.030" style="s2">by another people is not right I know</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.860" end="01:37:12.550" style="s2">that&#39;s right so I&#39;m commended to</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.030" end="01:37:15.490" style="s2">aligning my life to make it happen fully</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.550" end="01:37:18.400" style="s2">before knowing how there&#39;s a decision</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.490" end="01:37:20.860" style="s2">before the problem solving and so then</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.400" end="01:37:23.440" style="s2">it was like then because of that and he</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.860" end="01:37:25.780" style="s2">said so my how I&#39;m gonna just sit here</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.440" end="01:37:27.100" style="s2">in Journal and think about it and</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.780" end="01:37:29.320" style="s2">meditate and pray and do whatever</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.100" end="01:37:30.970" style="s2">process I have to come up with the how</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.320" end="01:37:33.580" style="s2">and then when I give that how I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.970" end="01:37:35.470" style="s2">try it and then when it failed he was</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.580" end="01:37:37.120" style="s2">like no I didn&#39;t they always learn</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.470" end="01:37:40.179" style="s2">something kind of like Edison&#39;s aibum</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.120" end="01:37:43.810" style="s2">tre again we have to take something</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.179" end="01:37:45.370" style="s2">an approach where there is a where</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.810" end="01:37:47.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a knowing that we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.370" end="01:37:49.600" style="s2">know how to do this fundamentally new</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.530" end="01:37:50.679" style="s2">phase yet we want to learn from all the</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.600" end="01:37:52.420" style="s2">people that have been thinking well</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.679" end="01:37:53.830" style="s2">about it and we want to be thinking well</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.420" end="01:37:55.659" style="s2">about it and we want to be adding our</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.830" end="01:37:57.580" style="s2">energy to it as best as we can and we</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.659" end="01:38:00.730" style="s2">want to get really fucking earnest about</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.580" end="01:38:03.190" style="s2">that and notice wait where am I actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.730" end="01:38:05.380" style="s2">just kind of mostly trying to win at the</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.190" end="01:38:07.750" style="s2">current system and and what does that</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.380" end="01:38:09.520" style="s2">mean and think more deeply about it so</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.750" end="01:38:14.890" style="s2">the first thing I would say is is really</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.520" end="01:38:16.630" style="s2">that like rather than yeah rather than</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.890" end="01:38:20.760" style="s2">you know me give an answer do this thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.630" end="01:38:24.429" style="s2">it&#39;s activate yourself as an agent of</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.760" end="01:38:26.440" style="s2">sense making as a capable being that can</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.429" end="01:38:29.370" style="s2">actually make sense of shit and think</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.440" end="01:38:35.710" style="s2">about it and and work on something and</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.370" end="01:38:38.530" style="s2">so the the answer what can you do I one</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.710" end="01:38:40.060" style="s2">thing that it is not is donate some</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.530" end="01:38:42.159" style="s2">money to charity and go do some</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.060" end="01:38:45.310" style="s2">volunteer work sometimes and recycle and</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.159" end="01:38:49.900" style="s2">like ride your bike to work all of that</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.310" end="01:38:51.730" style="s2">is lovely and we we still hit</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.900" end="01:38:54.280" style="s2">catastrophe if that&#39;s the if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.730" end="01:38:56.290" style="s2">best we&#39;re doing because it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.280" end="01:38:58.320" style="s2">decrease our personal consumption a</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.290" end="01:39:02.170" style="s2">little bit try and do some good stuff</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.320" end="01:39:03.489" style="s2">changes anything at scale Oh like people</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.170" end="01:39:04.719" style="s2">have to take a deeper level of</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.489" end="01:39:08.280" style="s2">responsibility for how do we actually</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.719" end="01:39:11.080" style="s2">change these meta systems what could a</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.280" end="01:39:12.760" style="s2">future of economics post capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.080" end="01:39:13.719" style="s2">that&#39;s viable really look like so then</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.760" end="01:39:15.550" style="s2">you say well I don&#39;t know let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.719" end="01:39:17.320" style="s2">studying at steady post capitalism and</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.550" end="01:39:19.179" style="s2">and study different systems that have</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.320" end="01:39:20.739" style="s2">been proposed and then look out what are</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.179" end="01:39:21.760" style="s2">groups that are working on things and is</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.739" end="01:39:24.070" style="s2">there something I can meaningfully</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.760" end="01:39:25.600" style="s2">contribute all right well that system</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.070" end="01:39:26.500" style="s2">makes sense but I have no idea how the</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.600" end="01:39:27.850" style="s2">fuck we get there</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.500" end="01:39:30.370" style="s2">all right what might a transitional</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.850" end="01:39:32.460" style="s2">system its intelligible to the current</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.370" end="01:39:34.570" style="s2">system but vectors towards that so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.460" end="01:39:37.000" style="s2">aspects of The Venus Project and</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.570" end="01:39:38.440" style="s2">resource-based economy&#39;s are not fully</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.000" end="01:39:39.790" style="s2">dialed in but there are parts of it that</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.440" end="01:39:42.760" style="s2">are right but how do you vector there</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.790" end="01:39:45.040" style="s2">may be some parts of crypto currency</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.760" end="01:39:46.690" style="s2">blockchain is also inadequate but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.040" end="01:39:50.590" style="s2">convector that you start kind of really</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.690" end="01:39:54.300" style="s2">dialing in what are the closest things</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.590" end="01:39:56.290" style="s2">we know for how to</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.300" end="01:39:58.750" style="s2">think about both what a viable</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.290" end="01:40:03.730" style="s2">civilization could look like and how we</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.750" end="01:40:05.199" style="s2">can vector there and yeah I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.730" end="01:40:08.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would really say is think</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.199" end="01:40:11.320" style="s2">about it earnestly educate yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.010" end="01:40:15.179" style="s2">work on it and actually realize that it</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.320" end="01:40:16.929" style="s2">matters that&#39;s really helpful thank you</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.179" end="01:40:19.210" style="s2">yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.929" end="01:40:21.040" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely it&#39;s keeping an it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.210" end="01:40:24.010" style="s2">an active mind and not just looking for</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.040" end="01:40:26.199" style="s2">quick fixes which I guess is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.010" end="01:40:28.540" style="s2">core of what what your work is and what</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.199" end="01:40:31.239" style="s2">neuro hacker is trying to do if people</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.540" end="01:40:33.250" style="s2">want to find out more about your own</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.239" end="01:40:37.239" style="s2">thinking and writing as well as neuro</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.250" end="01:40:42.760" style="s2">hacker where can they go to find you you</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.239" end="01:40:44.889" style="s2">know all of this work on kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.760" end="01:40:47.110" style="s2">macroeconomics and sense-making in</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.889" end="01:40:50.409" style="s2">governance and infrastructure there is</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.110" end="01:40:54.460" style="s2">no place that that&#39;s hosted on the web</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.409" end="01:40:56.139" style="s2">yet but there is about to be we you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.460" end="01:40:58.030" style="s2">we have some kind of think tank like</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.139" end="01:41:01.150" style="s2">organizations that focus on these things</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.030" end="01:41:03.610" style="s2">but it they&#39;re not publishing at some</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.150" end="01:41:05.530" style="s2">point they might I&#39;ll let you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.610" end="01:41:09.099" style="s2">about to put up a website in like a week</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.530" end="01:41:11.349" style="s2">or so and I&#39;ll give you the URL it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.099" end="01:41:15.610" style="s2">civilization emerging calm or something</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.349" end="01:41:18.340" style="s2">like that but you know for right now</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.610" end="01:41:20.290" style="s2">there&#39;s people can come make friends on</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.340" end="01:41:23.980" style="s2">Facebook and maybe see some things and</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.290" end="01:41:25.480" style="s2">neural hackers not really focused on you</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.980" end="01:41:28.690" style="s2">know future of macroeconomics whatever</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.480" end="01:41:31.840" style="s2">directly but it is focused on can we</p>
