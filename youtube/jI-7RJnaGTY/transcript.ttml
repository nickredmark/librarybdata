<p begin="00:01:21.860" end="00:01:28.210" style="s2">somewhere so so you might say that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.420" end="00:01:32.830" style="s2">past is something we can learn from and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.210" end="00:01:37.670" style="s2">and the present is something to live and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.830" end="00:01:40.009" style="s2">the future is something to love if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.670" end="00:01:41.420" style="s2">wanted to move forward healthily I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.009" end="00:01:44.899" style="s2">you could say a whole lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.420" end="00:01:48.319" style="s2">things as well of course and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.899" end="00:01:49.670" style="s2">something that can happen when someone&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:49.670" end="00:01:56.840" style="s2">the past that prevents them from doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.569" end="00:02:01.750" style="s2">so we get set up we get sort of locked</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.840" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">you know yeah I think you are a man who</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.750" end="00:02:10.819" style="s2">may be able to talk to that you know in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">a rather interesting way I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.819" end="00:02:16.940" style="s2">there&#39;s been a way we&#39;re oh well I&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">I think that the blocks that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.390" end="00:02:33.470" style="s2">learning from our mistakes they&#39;re a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:36.920" style="s2">about you know self-criticism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.470" end="00:02:41.810" style="s2">self-hatred and perfectionism and the or</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.920" end="00:02:44.629" style="s2">there&#39;s something that will make people</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.810" end="00:02:48.890" style="s2">realise an emotional aspect of it that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.629" end="00:02:50.599" style="s2">there needs to be a change or that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.890" end="00:02:53.330" style="s2">needs to be a new truth there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.599" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">something about growth that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.330" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">happen that&#39;s postponed or resisted that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:02.780" style="s2">I was a master of resistance from my</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">early LSD trips and had very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.780" end="00:03:07.130" style="s2">difficult led LSD trips and we just hold</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:10.040" style="s2">on and wouldn&#39;t let go and wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.130" end="00:03:12.290" style="s2">learn and just wasn&#39;t capable of it then</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.040" end="00:03:14.180" style="s2">I had a series of trips my first year of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.290" end="00:03:15.530" style="s2">college which eventually led me to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.180" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">know go to the guidance counselor and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.530" end="00:03:21.500" style="s2">learn about Stan Grof was to just take</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:23.300" style="s2">it just try to have whatever I heard</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.500" end="00:03:24.950" style="s2">about this mystical unit of experience I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.300" end="00:03:27.709" style="s2">want to know the truth I wanted to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.950" end="00:03:30.709" style="s2">a different understanding I want to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.709" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">out of being confused and I would have</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.709" end="00:03:33.560" style="s2">these very strong trips a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:35.900" style="s2">would happen I&#39;d have these different</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.560" end="00:03:40.459" style="s2">emotions but then I would I&#39;d still be</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.900" end="00:03:43.489" style="s2">like I you know I know I would have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.459" end="00:03:44.870" style="s2">difficult time letting things happen I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.489" end="00:03:46.970" style="s2">would end up resisting and I would feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.870" end="00:03:48.800" style="s2">just incredible friction of my brain and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.970" end="00:03:53.030" style="s2">then it was me doing it and I was fail</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.800" end="00:03:55.400" style="s2">it was for me it was like even the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.030" end="00:03:56.930" style="s2">emotional circuits I wasn&#39;t prepared I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.400" end="00:03:58.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the capacity these are</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.930" end="00:04:00.050" style="s2">strong emotions and I hadn&#39;t built up</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.520" end="00:04:02.360" style="s2">even my capacity driving with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.050" end="00:04:05.600" style="s2">lightning rod what they do and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.360" end="00:04:09.019" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.600" end="00:04:10.910" style="s2">ways that people get blocked and there</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.019" end="00:04:13.670" style="s2">are some ways that we&#39;re learning about</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.910" end="00:04:15.739" style="s2">how to unblock if people are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.670" end="00:04:17.959" style="s2">do it and it&#39;s not just about the drug I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.739" end="00:04:20.989" style="s2">think that&#39;s very important to say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.959" end="00:04:24.260" style="s2">it&#39;s drugs or other drugs but as 70a my</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:26.270" style="s2">assistant psychotherapy for PTSD but</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.260" end="00:04:28.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a voluntary part where the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.270" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">people are ultimately healing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.040" end="00:04:33.500" style="s2">and they have to choose to do so and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">choose to face things and and so has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.500" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">be voluntary right some important thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:40.130" style="s2">it has to come from the individual yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:41.900" style="s2">so we have a not I mean a very just to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.130" end="00:04:43.790" style="s2">give you an example we don&#39;t ever hand</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.900" end="00:04:45.470" style="s2">MDMA to somebody right you know we put</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.790" end="00:04:47.479" style="s2">it down and they have to take it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.470" end="00:04:50.419" style="s2">themselves when my very start and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.479" end="00:04:51.979" style="s2">it&#39;s their own inner wisdom that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.419" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">helping them with and they have to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.979" end="00:05:00.250" style="s2">these decisions and come to feel certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:05:00.250" style="s2">things and and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.270" end="00:05:04.600" style="s2">once people recognize that - that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.040" end="00:05:06.640" style="s2">not so automatic taking pill and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.600" end="00:05:10.180" style="s2">something happens that you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.640" end="00:05:13.330" style="s2">it happen and own it people can find</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.180" end="00:05:15.820" style="s2">less punitive ways to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.330" end="00:05:17.650" style="s2">self-criticism or they can be more self</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.820" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">loving and forgiving and just they have</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.650" end="00:05:22.510" style="s2">a kind of relaxation I mean this rabbi</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">Zalman Schechter described MDMA as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.510" end="00:05:28.540" style="s2">delight like the Sabbath right you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:31.630" style="s2">a really yeah that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.540" end="00:05:38.910" style="s2">interesting I mean there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.630" end="00:05:44.830" style="s2">about the relationship to light mmm that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.910" end="00:05:46.270" style="s2">so I mean with respect and motivation</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.830" end="00:05:48.430" style="s2">it&#39;s something in front of you you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.270" end="00:05:49.930" style="s2">it&#39;s something to move towards right but</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.430" end="00:05:52.420" style="s2">it&#39;s all but it&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.930" end="00:05:55.300" style="s2">that well yes I mean imagine if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.420" end="00:05:57.400" style="s2">in a cave and it&#39;s it&#39;s morning you need</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.300" end="00:05:59.410" style="s2">to go out there into the day right I</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:02.140" style="s2">mean it&#39;s also you know a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.410" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">motif you know that the Sun being</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.140" end="00:06:05.950" style="s2">consciousness about the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">and then things like this it is a primal</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.950" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">thing and I think sometimes in in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.260" end="00:06:14.470" style="s2">certain mystical experiences you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">have there is also the movement towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.470" end="00:06:18.580" style="s2">something you know sometimes but but but</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:22.840" style="s2">but more generally it&#39;s important to set</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.580" end="00:06:23.650" style="s2">goals you know and and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.840" end="00:06:26.470" style="s2">interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.650" end="00:06:29.550" style="s2">yeah Eisenhower the General Eisenhower</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.470" end="00:06:33.580" style="s2">you in president he has a saying that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.550" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">planning is everything plans are nothing</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.580" end="00:06:40.570" style="s2">you know I have you have to say your</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.960" end="00:06:42.700" style="s2">goals but there&#39;s so many you know plans</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.570" end="00:06:45.040" style="s2">that you make that keep getting sorted</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.700" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">by reality or just absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.040" end="00:06:48.460" style="s2">absolutely but the thing is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:49.930" style="s2">make the plans in order to then judge</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.460" end="00:06:52.030" style="s2">whether or not things are Co hearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.930" end="00:06:53.380" style="s2">with them and the thing is where is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.030" end="00:06:56.020" style="s2">where does the ability to set those</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.380" end="00:06:57.880" style="s2">goals come from now I actually think I</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.020" end="00:07:00.700" style="s2">actually think Rick that it comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.880" end="00:07:02.380" style="s2">place that blurs the line between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.700" end="00:07:05.700" style="s2">psychological and the metaphysical if</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.380" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">you take certain things into account I</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.700" end="00:07:12.250" style="s2">well I feel that the impetus for me to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:13.129" style="s2">study psychedelics comes from multiple</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.250" end="00:07:14.539" style="s2">generations be</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.129" end="00:07:16.729" style="s2">me who were killed killed in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.539" end="00:07:19.459" style="s2">Holocaust and in other ways so that if</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.729" end="00:07:22.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what you mean that the goal comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.459" end="00:07:26.059" style="s2">from life that happened before I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.550" end="00:07:27.619" style="s2">even born well well I mean that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.059" end="00:07:28.969" style="s2">lot of sense right I mean we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.619" end="00:07:31.309" style="s2">creatures with the history we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.969" end="00:07:32.869" style="s2">evolved over a very long time and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.309" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">might think that what also moves other</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.869" end="00:07:37.429" style="s2">beings forward into life is is in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:40.669" style="s2">sense the same essence that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.429" end="00:07:42.860" style="s2">that capacity as well now in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.669" end="00:07:44.089" style="s2">right now we can use many other words to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.860" end="00:07:45.649" style="s2">talk about things that are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.089" end="00:07:48.559" style="s2">and things to do but but there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.649" end="00:07:50.869" style="s2">something I think really essential about</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.559" end="00:07:52.909" style="s2">this this sort of a will to movement or</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.869" end="00:07:57.169" style="s2">a will to life is philosophical ideas</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.909" end="00:08:04.429" style="s2">but you know in order to in order to set</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.169" end="00:08:05.990" style="s2">goals sometimes I feel you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.429" end="00:08:09.519" style="s2">have to figure out where you are and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.990" end="00:08:13.639" style="s2">also where you&#39;ve been and I guess with</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.519" end="00:08:18.589" style="s2">MDMA we well how would you describe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.639" end="00:08:22.159" style="s2">experience of MDMA hmm in in that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.589" end="00:08:24.769" style="s2">that allows you to not only just accept</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.159" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">what you are now but tip what did to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.769" end="00:08:34.909" style="s2">deal with the past how do you even yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.050" end="00:08:41.029" style="s2">here&#39;s a okay there&#39;s a MDMA is like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.909" end="00:08:44.319" style="s2">deep breath and it helps you to think</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.029" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">clearly to the ways in which our fears</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.319" end="00:08:51.410" style="s2">block our thinking we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">think certain things you know look at we</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.410" end="00:08:56.180" style="s2">don&#39;t want to think that that ice can</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:59.089" style="s2">actually be melting and we could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:00.889" style="s2">changing the climate of the earth you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.089" end="00:09:03.350" style="s2">know and so we have people that reject</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.889" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">it with climate change denial and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.350" end="00:09:09.889" style="s2">you know how can they how how is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">this is the earth cooling by the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.889" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.430" end="00:09:29.660" style="s2">Rick that news better have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.329" end="00:09:29.660" style="s2">extremely important Rita is showing up</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.930" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">so then I guess I guess MDMA as a deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.160" end="00:09:40.139" style="s2">breath</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">yeah and that by helping calm the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.139" end="00:09:44.370" style="s2">emotions you can think more clearly so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:51.180" style="s2">one of the veterans that was in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.370" end="00:09:54.449" style="s2">study was long PTSD after friends were</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.180" end="00:09:57.180" style="s2">killed and wounded in Iraq and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.449" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">described the healing from a medium dose</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.180" end="00:10:03.930" style="s2">of 75 milligrams with this idea that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:05.610" style="s2">he came to the realization that the PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.930" end="00:10:07.649" style="s2">was his way of staying connected with</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.610" end="00:10:12.300" style="s2">his friends who had been killed and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.649" end="00:10:14.339" style="s2">was a sign of loyalty this was it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.300" end="00:10:16.260" style="s2">and but then he looked at it from there</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.339" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">every one of you and he said these</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.260" end="00:10:20.790" style="s2">people are dead they wouldn&#39;t want me to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:25.050" style="s2">suffer they can&#39;t live they would want</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.790" end="00:10:26.250" style="s2">me to live for them and he said now what</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.050" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">am I going to do with the rest of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.250" end="00:10:33.810" style="s2">life and in that moment he healed</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.240" end="00:10:39.570" style="s2">himself from PTSD and there was just</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.810" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">this well thank god we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.570" end="00:10:49.019" style="s2">save the world hey okay because Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">Christ well I don&#39;t think anyone could</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.019" end="00:10:54.660" style="s2">but at the same strange thing that every</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:56.370" style="s2">individual is an individual and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.660" end="00:10:59.069" style="s2">responsible for themselves you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.370" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">so in that sense there is that ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.069" end="00:11:03.149" style="s2">responsibility right yeah that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">scary actually and but it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.149" end="00:11:07.140" style="s2">finding your point of leverage like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.220" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">who are you knowing your past as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.140" end="00:11:12.139" style="s2">saying knowing what&#39;s the current</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">situation and where can you make a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.139" end="00:11:17.339" style="s2">contribution that&#39;s you know uses your</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">abilities and what the world needs in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.339" end="00:11:23.410" style="s2">some kind of pattern and yes you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:26.769" style="s2">there is something about how</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.410" end="00:11:33.790" style="s2">I thought a lot of people would actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.769" end="00:11:36.329" style="s2">see psychedelics as a solution and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.790" end="00:11:38.769" style="s2">know eventually it&#39;s turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.329" end="00:11:41.350" style="s2">well they certainly can be they can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.769" end="00:11:45.370" style="s2">remarkable solutions for and for lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.350" end="00:11:48.730" style="s2">people with with and about problems that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.370" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">are so fundamental and and important to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.730" end="00:11:52.600" style="s2">all of us which is really quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:54.189" style="s2">interesting and I think the title beyond</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.600" end="00:11:57.339" style="s2">psychedelics I&#39;ve come to understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.189" end="00:11:57.759" style="s2">it&#39;s about you know what do we do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.339" end="00:11:59.350" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.759" end="00:12:02.199" style="s2">absolutely they help us move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:04.689" style="s2">those moments into our integration into</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.199" end="00:12:05.649" style="s2">our daily life into our choices in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.689" end="00:12:07.110" style="s2">world yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.649" end="00:12:09.160" style="s2">absolutely I think that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.110" end="00:12:12.970" style="s2">intention as a message and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.160" end="00:12:15.699" style="s2">of course the experience you have on</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.970" end="00:12:16.899" style="s2">psychedelics is at least in big part a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.699" end="00:12:18.459" style="s2">product of the life you&#39;ve been living</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.899" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">and what you&#39;ve been doing and who you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.459" end="00:12:22.569" style="s2">are now we might talk about fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.490" style="s2">themes we all go through right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.569" end="00:12:25.720" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s yeah but the specifics</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.490" end="00:12:27.550" style="s2">of how they manifest like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.720" end="00:12:28.720" style="s2">particulars you know yeah it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.550" end="00:12:30.639" style="s2">continuous with the life you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:32.649" style="s2">and also where you&#39;re already aiming and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:33.880" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s the well it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.649" end="00:12:36.040" style="s2">that way for them to be useful and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.880" end="00:12:37.540" style="s2">important otherwise it would be in just</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.040" end="00:12:38.920" style="s2">some strange escape with no relevance to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.540" end="00:12:41.529" style="s2">the world but of course it is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.920" end="00:12:46.360" style="s2">relevant to the world but also something</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.529" end="00:12:49.000" style="s2">that my word it requires a certain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.360" end="00:12:50.589" style="s2">a certain kind of serious attitude it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.000" end="00:12:51.730" style="s2">not it&#39;s not as though you there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.589" end="00:12:53.079" style="s2">still the lightness and fun and these</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.730" end="00:12:56.949" style="s2">different things but these are powerful</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.079" end="00:12:59.370" style="s2">things and yeah and although there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.949" end="00:13:04.870" style="s2">there&#39;s so many different ways to help I</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.370" end="00:13:07.930" style="s2">mean people can you know pick something</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.870" end="00:13:10.680" style="s2">example and yeah and that&#39;s doing good</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.930" end="00:13:13.180" style="s2">that&#39;s moving things forward and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.680" end="00:13:18.220" style="s2">over time you see what&#39;s right for you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.180" end="00:13:20.230" style="s2">or yeah yeah I have the my son and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.220" end="00:13:24.220" style="s2">daughter have both graduated college</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.230" end="00:13:26.439" style="s2">just this last month oh that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.220" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">and so they&#39;re both in this like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.439" end="00:13:29.220" style="s2">know how do you choose what you do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:32.910" style="s2">Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.220" end="00:13:35.889" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.910" end="00:13:37.080" style="s2">the existential question damn college is</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.889" end="00:13:39.850" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.080" end="00:13:41.620" style="s2">look they at least at least the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.850" end="00:13:43.150" style="s2">the question is good the question is an</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.620" end="00:13:45.010" style="s2">important way that&#39;s the crucial one</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.150" end="00:13:47.740" style="s2">yeah because but but you can find it out</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.010" end="00:13:52.090" style="s2">the answers you might not get in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.740" end="00:13:53.470" style="s2">blinding flash well we might I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.090" end="00:13:54.970" style="s2">it I suppose it could happen and of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.470" end="00:13:56.440" style="s2">course inspiration strikes if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.970" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">doing anything create if there are lots</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.440" end="00:13:59.050" style="s2">of different little things you do and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:00.640" style="s2">you take action on them and you do them</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.050" end="00:14:01.990" style="s2">so the inspiration striking is something</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.640" end="00:14:04.510" style="s2">that can all relate to however the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.990" end="00:14:08.140" style="s2">problem is sometimes that life is so</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.510" end="00:14:09.610" style="s2">complicated that you know you really</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.140" end="00:14:11.110" style="s2">have to step out there into the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.610" end="00:14:12.820" style="s2">and see what works and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.110" end="00:14:14.530" style="s2">before you can be totally sure and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.820" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">for anything complicated it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.530" end="00:14:17.860" style="s2">effort that you obviously have to stick</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">out for a long time yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.860" end="00:14:21.190" style="s2">something obviously that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:24.250" style="s2">able to do so incredibly well which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.190" end="00:14:28.590" style="s2">very it&#39;s very impressive for me okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.250" end="00:14:32.080" style="s2">the good fortune to see something change</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.590" end="00:14:33.520" style="s2">over so in 1990 is when we first started</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.520" end="00:14:39.850" style="s2">to try to interest them in MDMA for PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.250" end="00:14:42.340" style="s2">mm-hmm and we kept being rejected and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.850" end="00:14:46.740" style="s2">rejected and rejected it was there was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.340" end="00:14:55.660" style="s2">dissent it was it was particularly a and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.740" end="00:15:00.600" style="s2">then just last year we were you know our</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.660" end="00:15:03.580" style="s2">study is finally going to be conducted</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.600" end="00:15:06.010" style="s2">inside someone who&#39;s affiliated with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.580" end="00:15:07.840" style="s2">VA in a way but who&#39;s head of a major</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.010" end="00:15:09.100" style="s2">Department of Psychiatry and so he</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.840" end="00:15:10.690" style="s2">finally said yes to him do you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.100" end="00:15:14.980" style="s2">research but it was the same one that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.690" end="00:15:19.150" style="s2">said no in 1990 so it&#39;s you know 27</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.980" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">years Jesus see somebody initially</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.150" end="00:15:25.450" style="s2">fearful and resist them yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:28.510" style="s2">the thing to say is that it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.450" end="00:15:30.850" style="s2">that long you know that&#39;s not a really</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.510" end="00:15:32.230" style="s2">very long time it is a long time but</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.850" end="00:15:34.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.230" end="00:15:35.560" style="s2">right yeah I think that you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.420" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">couldn&#39;t even see change in your own</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.560" end="00:15:38.290" style="s2">lifetime you&#39;re lucky you&#39;re just born</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:40.870" style="s2">at the right time and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.290" end="00:15:45.580" style="s2">fortunate in terms of trans yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.870" end="00:15:48.910" style="s2">sure I think for people to choose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.580" end="00:15:50.710" style="s2">like yeah I think you have long term</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.910" end="00:15:51.139" style="s2">plans I mean you can have goals that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.710" end="00:15:55.369" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.139" end="00:15:59.389" style="s2">long term and and then you you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.369" end="00:16:01.910" style="s2">develop little efforts along the way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.389" end="00:16:03.739" style="s2">do pieces of that totally totally I ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.910" end="00:16:04.819" style="s2">I have a friend of mine a wonderful man</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.739" end="00:16:06.709" style="s2">named Neville Christie you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.819" end="00:16:08.179" style="s2">sometimes say if you&#39;re going to Rome</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.709" end="00:16:09.559" style="s2">sometimes you need to go through Naples</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.179" end="00:16:10.910" style="s2">and when you&#39;re in Naples you meet you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.559" end="00:16:12.949" style="s2">realize you might need to go to Venice</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.910" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">now I have no Geographic knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.949" end="00:16:17.929" style="s2">Italy so this going all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:20.419" style="s2">overhead figuratively alright and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.929" end="00:16:22.189" style="s2">but you know the point is you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.419" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">reassess along the way and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.189" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">exactly as it as it should be it needs</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:27.919" style="s2">to be because you don&#39;t have all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:29.299" style="s2">knowledge at the beginning and and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.919" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">don&#39;t have all the knowledge at the end</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.299" end="00:16:35.059" style="s2">but you hopefully have a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:37.850" style="s2">anyway but Rick I know we don&#39;t have too</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.059" end="00:16:41.720" style="s2">long together thank you for sharing this</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.850" end="00:16:43.579" style="s2">time with me if I could ask you if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.720" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">could ask you one question sure it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.579" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">be go ahead so let&#39;s think about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.290" end="00:17:02.959" style="s2">where are you aiming now Europe all</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.509" end="00:17:06.650" style="s2">right we all ready hey mate are you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.959" end="00:17:10.669" style="s2">gonna burrow downwards in the very next</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.650" end="00:17:12.740" style="s2">few days if not even potentially today I</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.669" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t even checked but probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.740" end="00:17:15.140" style="s2">tomorrow or Wednesday we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">receive a letter from the European</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.140" end="00:17:19.370" style="s2">Medicines Agency interesting and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:21.709" style="s2">going to include this the results of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.370" end="00:17:24.110" style="s2">discussions that have taken place over</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.709" end="00:17:26.809" style="s2">about six months so far and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.110" end="00:17:29.299" style="s2">to include their scientific advice for</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.809" end="00:17:32.510" style="s2">what we need to do for phase three in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.299" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">order to make MDMA into a medicine then</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.510" end="00:17:44.380" style="s2">we need to develop a a protocol and a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:47.240" style="s2">budget and then we need to raise</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.380" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">probably eight million dollars of which</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.240" end="00:17:52.520" style="s2">I think we have almost a million already</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:56.330" style="s2">and then we need to train about forty</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.520" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2">therapists and then next summer 2019 I</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.330" end="00:18:03.590" style="s2">hope we start phase three in Europe but</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.450" end="00:18:07.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a rapid timeline and and we will</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.590" end="00:18:10.730" style="s2">be starting phase three for FDA in</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.640" end="00:18:13.880" style="s2">August okay so that&#39;s the organisational</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.730" end="00:18:16.580" style="s2">aim now I suppose another question might</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.880" end="00:18:18.890" style="s2">be ok no no it&#39;s it&#39;s I I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.580" end="00:18:21.080" style="s2">interested in its going on yeah but also</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.890" end="00:18:22.490" style="s2">I think it&#39;s always interesting to ask I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.080" end="00:18:23.690" style="s2">mean you probably got asked it&#39;s all a</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.490" end="00:18:26.450" style="s2">lot so it&#39;s not a particularly valuable</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.690" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">base it&#39;s helpful to to formulate where</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.450" end="00:18:30.260" style="s2">you hate well I like to be updating my</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:33.650" style="s2">thinking is always valuable oh it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.260" end="00:18:36.669" style="s2">it is it&#39;s sides you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.650" end="00:18:39.530" style="s2">what the hell&#39;s going on Jesus but ok so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.669" end="00:18:42.230" style="s2">your role within this is probably quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.530" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">clear to you in certain respects but in</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.230" end="00:18:48.919" style="s2">others I guess because things are so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:51.740" style="s2">world is so complicated and dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.919" end="00:18:53.090" style="s2">dynamic and the community psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.740" end="00:18:53.870" style="s2">and otherwise is so large but just</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.090" end="00:18:55.940" style="s2">taking a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.870" end="00:18:57.290" style="s2">community aids is small in some respects</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.940" end="00:18:58.790" style="s2">but large in terms of the different</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.290" end="00:19:00.230" style="s2">voices in there yeah yeah even though</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.790" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">there are definitely binding features</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.230" end="00:19:02.990" style="s2">there are different voices people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:04.429" style="s2">different intentions quite different</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.990" end="00:19:06.290" style="s2">intentions for the world fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.429" end="00:19:07.890" style="s2">if you were to just let them go off and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.290" end="00:19:09.210" style="s2">paint it on some virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.890" end="00:19:13.470" style="s2">page which which of course some people</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.210" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">are trying to do what what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.470" end="00:19:26.100" style="s2">that what are the key features of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:28.110" style="s2">community or a way to discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.100" end="00:19:30.030" style="s2">current state of play and the value</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.110" end="00:19:33.830" style="s2">associated with the integration of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.030" end="00:19:36.390" style="s2">psychedelics into our life and society</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.830" end="00:19:39.630" style="s2">what are the fundamental features of how</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.390" end="00:19:42.150" style="s2">that discussion should happen that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.630" end="00:19:44.850" style="s2">believe absolutely need to be there and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.150" end="00:19:47.940" style="s2">kept vital and alive or are still vital</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.850" end="00:19:53.100" style="s2">and alive well I&#39;d say respecting the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.940" end="00:19:54.540" style="s2">fears and the questions of the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.100" end="00:19:59.930" style="s2">people that you&#39;re negotiating</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.540" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">discussing one you know this society the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.930" end="00:20:05.340" style="s2">culture the FDA the regulator&#39;s the EMA</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:09.630" style="s2">that there&#39;s they&#39;re coming from a place</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.630" end="00:20:18.750" style="s2">of requirements some irrational some are</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.930" end="00:20:21.060" style="s2">not that rational some our denial of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.750" end="00:20:24.360" style="s2">reality some are really open that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.060" end="00:20:26.700" style="s2">there&#39;s just a way in which the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.360" end="00:20:28.710" style="s2">part is listening to what the what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.700" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2">they&#39;re saying and trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.710" end="00:20:31.080" style="s2">what their concerns are</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.790" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">which may be somewhat different than</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.080" end="00:20:34.890" style="s2">what they express them maybe they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">always expressing them so it&#39;s to try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.890" end="00:20:40.470" style="s2">understand what their real goals are and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:43.590" style="s2">then try to respond to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:45.540" style="s2">so for us it&#39;s been the progress we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.590" end="00:20:48.030" style="s2">made with the FDA has been from</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.540" end="00:20:50.760" style="s2">listening to the FDA and then trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.030" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">help them help us so it&#39;s the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.760" end="00:20:54.450" style="s2">learned at the Kennedy School of</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.500" end="00:21:14.760" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to present a case as clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.150" end="00:21:18.730" style="s2">and simple as you can then as weighted</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.760" end="00:21:20.360" style="s2">and balanced as that and that</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.700" end="00:21:31.220" style="s2">sort of science and was the one dose of</p>
