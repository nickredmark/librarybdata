<p begin="00:00:01.829" end="00:00:04.950" style="s2">conversations we spend 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:06.990" style="s2">talking about what it currently looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.950" end="00:00:09.000" style="s2">like in this case in media entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.990" end="00:00:10.710" style="s2">and then 15 minutes talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">we&#39;d like it to look like an hour ideal</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.710" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">version of a ideal world version however</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">far in the future that needs to be and</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">then we spend half an hour talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:24.600" style="s2">but 10,000 people and $100,000 could</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">actually do right now in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.600" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">space come up with an actual adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:30.869" style="s2">possible so for the first part we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:32.520" style="s2">usually just end up ranting Eric would</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.869" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">you like to start down usually start</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.520" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">right good I can rant on media and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">entertainment no problem get the rant</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:45.110" style="s2">out of the way and then we can get down</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:47.910" style="s2">to the solution I&#39;m not going first</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.110" end="00:00:51.860" style="s2">that&#39;s totally valid do want me to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.910" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">first Eric since usually all right oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.860" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">media and entertainment particularly</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">this is a weird one because it&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:05.030" style="s2">imitates art and art imitates life so</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:05.030" style="s2">how much is how much it is art responds</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.970" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">there we go there we go so having a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.260" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">levitate art it&#39;s funny Eric just let</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">let us let us cigarette because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">part of like back in the was it the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">when media stopped allowing or stopped</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">having cigarettes but everywhere it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">actually did go down a fairway is one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">my things that always I get really</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">annoyed in media when they carry around</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">those coffee cups that are disposable my</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">mom gets really annoyed because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">light mints so it&#39;s just like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">not even full of coffee at least filled</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:38.850" style="s2">a bowl of water like how hard would it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">be for all the cops to carry reusable</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.850" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">ones because then people would start to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">mimic it but they get the cops don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">carry your usable ones so they want it</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">to look real so then Pete and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">people mimic the what people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:52.409" style="s2">carrying around and it ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">self perpetuating there&#39;s a lot of I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.409" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">thinking about in the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">technology and and media entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:00.149" style="s2">so much money is spent when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:02.670" style="s2">new film and and I live in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.149" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">where like city streets are shut down so</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.670" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">that so they can film it and yet it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">much risk and so much labor for</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:13.550" style="s2">something that may or may not succeed</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:16.550" style="s2">the diversity is getting better with</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.550" end="00:02:18.230" style="s2">and movies and media there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.550" end="00:02:20.330" style="s2">people of color and disability and our</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.230" end="00:02:23.030" style="s2">divergence and stuff that&#39;s that&#39;s shown</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.330" end="00:02:25.300" style="s2">but way less than representation and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.030" end="00:02:29.720" style="s2">lot of that has to do with profit and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.300" end="00:02:32.090" style="s2">I&#39;m sketching here the same time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.720" end="00:02:33.530" style="s2">just a lot like a lot of it being for</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.090" end="00:02:35.450" style="s2">profit but of course it&#39;s for profit</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.530" end="00:02:38.390" style="s2">it&#39;s entertainment and how important is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.450" end="00:02:41.750" style="s2">entertainment I shadow yes like I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:44.860" style="s2">absolutely love watching sorry to chide</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.750" end="00:02:46.820" style="s2">like me to do I mean that you having I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.860" end="00:02:48.260" style="s2">feel like my thoughts are very</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.820" end="00:02:49.460" style="s2">distractive day and I might just end it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.260" end="00:02:50.630" style="s2">there and let someone else rat for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.460" end="00:02:52.700" style="s2">while I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll come up with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.630" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">but it&#39;s like a lot of money to take on</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.700" end="00:03:00.860" style="s2">risk when I really enjoy media but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">wish that we could kind of vote on what</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.860" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">gets made like I wish this is all good</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:08.150" style="s2">comment section okay anyway would anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">else like to share what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:11.660" style="s2">the media and entertainment and what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:13.130" style="s2">currently do for it how you you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.660" end="00:03:18.890" style="s2">what you like about it and don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.130" end="00:03:21.140" style="s2">about it I&#39;ll go just because I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.890" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">pick up on your point about smoking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.140" end="00:03:26.450" style="s2">when ads for smoking were banned and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:28.220" style="s2">they were no longer allowed to sponsor</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.450" end="00:03:29.630" style="s2">sporting events and all of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.220" end="00:03:31.580" style="s2">thing the tobacco companies what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.630" end="00:03:33.770" style="s2">did instead was they encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:35.570" style="s2">characters in movies to smoke more and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.770" end="00:03:37.910" style="s2">if you look at the incidence of smoking</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.570" end="00:03:39.260" style="s2">in movies since tobacco advertising was</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.910" end="00:03:41.959" style="s2">banned it&#39;s gone through the roof so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.260" end="00:03:46.430" style="s2">product placement you know putting using</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.959" end="00:03:47.959" style="s2">art as advertising conduits you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.430" end="00:03:49.640" style="s2">what I mean this is this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.959" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">things that kind of makes me a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.640" end="00:03:52.850" style="s2">bit ill then as that it&#39;s not restricted</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:55.160" style="s2">to the background in product placement</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.850" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">exists in TV shows and movies all over</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.160" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">the place a big source of revenue for</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:02.270" style="s2">the makers of movies and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:04.610" style="s2">must impinge to some degree on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.270" end="00:04:05.959" style="s2">artistic process obvious is a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.610" end="00:04:09.020" style="s2">here in some cases it impinges a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.959" end="00:04:12.650" style="s2">more than others right but for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.020" end="00:04:16.790" style="s2">so I guess there&#39;s the core of my rent</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.650" end="00:04:19.220" style="s2">is that money and profit really have no</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.790" end="00:04:21.290" style="s2">business in the in in the world of art</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:22.940" style="s2">and media and entertainment right stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.290" end="00:04:24.680" style="s2">she made simply because it&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.940" end="00:04:26.600" style="s2">it&#39;s fun to make and people want to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.680" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">it and people want to see it or listen</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.600" end="00:04:30.530" style="s2">to it or</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:32.480" style="s2">or whatever it might be and as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.530" end="00:04:34.430" style="s2">you inject money into it and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.480" end="00:04:37.130" style="s2">requirement to get back your investment</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.430" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">right and the requirement to fund it you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.130" end="00:04:40.970" style="s2">know find funding for it as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:43.700" style="s2">go out looking for people to fund your</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.970" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">project they now expect to have some</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.700" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">kind of input into the project right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">once again the artistic integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:51.410" style="s2">thing itself is compromised so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:52.790" style="s2">whatever the whatever I know this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.410" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">slightly jumping here but whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.790" end="00:04:59.060" style="s2">future of art and media is to be it has</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:05:01.430" style="s2">to somehow divorce itself from this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.060" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">whole need to make profit right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.430" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">made because it&#39;s good and people want</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:05.750" style="s2">to get involved in the project and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the barrier not that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.750" end="00:05:08.090" style="s2">raise the money but people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:11.270" style="s2">interested because it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.090" end="00:05:14.230" style="s2">right and as simple as that so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.270" end="00:05:14.230" style="s2">guess I&#39;ll stop there</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.430" end="00:05:20.750" style="s2">sure Laura Daniel do you wanna do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.960" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">wanna share I do have notes here I feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.750" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">like I rambled for way too long and said</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">nothing when I did buy-in so I can go</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:33.650" style="s2">honestly I haven&#39;t thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.920" end="00:05:39.320" style="s2">topic a whole lot so I&#39;ll be honest</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.650" end="00:05:40.790" style="s2">about that I think that media means so</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.320" end="00:05:46.390" style="s2">many different things</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.790" end="00:05:49.340" style="s2">I have studied social media a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.390" end="00:05:53.800" style="s2">and I&#39;m kind of more knowledgeable and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.340" end="00:05:57.669" style="s2">like understanding some types of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.800" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">problems and potential solutions there</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.669" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">but on the whole you know like I say</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:07.340" style="s2">there&#39;s different types of media there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">as print media there&#39;s there&#39;s pamphlets</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.340" end="00:06:16.100" style="s2">then there&#39;s movies there&#39;s TV so this I</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:18.890" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to think about like</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.100" end="00:06:22.070" style="s2">what different areas obviously I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.890" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">that like I don&#39;t have like a rant I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.070" end="00:06:30.590" style="s2">not that emotional about topic I do like</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:34.300" style="s2">what was mentioned about like you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.590" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">the disposable cups or the smoking thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.300" end="00:06:45.650" style="s2">we are it is a way to influence culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:49.430" style="s2">we&#39;re giving folks who have these great</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.650" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">big platforms on now like you know TV</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:54.110" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know how many people watch</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:56.629" style="s2">TV Netflix or whatever say you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.110" end="00:06:58.879" style="s2">popular show that&#39;s like popular just</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.629" end="00:07:00.889" style="s2">for the sake of it look I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.879" end="00:07:04.310" style="s2">have a problem with that like people</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.889" end="00:07:06.740" style="s2">seem to like being entertained but now</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.310" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">you have this moment you have moments</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.740" end="00:07:13.639" style="s2">for teachable moments and we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:15.409" style="s2">influence culture positively or</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.639" end="00:07:18.860" style="s2">negatively through those teachable</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.409" end="00:07:24.919" style="s2">moments like you say you know having</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.860" end="00:07:29.419" style="s2">more diversity having more diverse types</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.919" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">of people types of relationships you</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.419" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">know having having LGBT relationships on</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:39.439" style="s2">shows and things you know that whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:45.099" style="s2">gamut like so there&#39;s opportunities to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.439" end="00:07:48.590" style="s2">show more holistic moments of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.099" end="00:07:51.409" style="s2">getting people like outside the box so</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.590" end="00:07:54.110" style="s2">can that be framed inside of like a show</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.409" end="00:07:57.349" style="s2">that&#39;s just geared on pure entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.110" end="00:08:00.610" style="s2">comedy or something like yeah it seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.349" end="00:08:03.560" style="s2">like there&#39;s opportunities for that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.610" end="00:08:07.610" style="s2">lately so we&#39;ve got like these teachable</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.560" end="00:08:13.940" style="s2">moments lately I do think a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.610" end="00:08:17.509" style="s2">our waste problem and I recently watched</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.940" end="00:08:20.330" style="s2">that what is it called the planet of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.509" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">humans that documentary that came out</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.330" end="00:08:26.360" style="s2">and so like as an engineer type that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:30.580" style="s2">pretty eye-opening I&#39;m kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.360" end="00:08:33.050" style="s2">renewable energy stuff that&#39;s going on I</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.580" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">you know I want to fact-check some</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.050" end="00:08:39.740" style="s2">things but like point--is seems like</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:42.979" style="s2">much of our solutions in waste have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.740" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">come with reducing what we&#39;re spending</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.979" end="00:08:50.890" style="s2">and doing and so if I&#39;m emotional about</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:53.660" style="s2">any of that or something it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.890" end="00:08:54.889" style="s2">Wow when you look at all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.660" end="00:09:00.769" style="s2">television show</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.889" end="00:09:05.269" style="s2">and movies the production cost not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.769" end="00:09:09.649" style="s2">on monetary side but the stuff all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.269" end="00:09:12.889" style="s2">costumes all of the energy you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.649" end="00:09:14.449" style="s2">petroleum or whatever that&#39;s put in to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.889" end="00:09:17.029" style="s2">these things so they&#39;re just these</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.449" end="00:09:19.669" style="s2">moments and time that get recorded and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.029" end="00:09:21.619" style="s2">then poof it&#39;s gone I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.669" end="00:09:24.699" style="s2">what happens to all that stuff I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.619" end="00:09:27.290" style="s2">hopefully studio spaces get reused but</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.699" end="00:09:29.230" style="s2">flying equipment all around the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.290" end="00:09:31.790" style="s2">for these shoots and everything it seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.230" end="00:09:34.249" style="s2">it reminds me a little bit of sports</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.790" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">like it seems like a total waste of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.249" end="00:09:43.069" style="s2">time and energy so maybe that&#39;s part two</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:50.359" style="s2">I guess the other thing that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.069" end="00:09:53.179" style="s2">mind is the difficulty in the access so</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.359" end="00:09:55.549" style="s2">there&#39;s like moments there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.179" end="00:09:59.569" style="s2">teachable moments and advertising inside</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.549" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">of existing shows television and movies</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.569" end="00:10:09.439" style="s2">but it also looks like um the people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:12.439" style="s2">have had all the monetary resources for</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.439" end="00:10:15.079" style="s2">the past hundred years they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.439" end="00:10:18.499" style="s2">deciding what gets put in front of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.079" end="00:10:20.149" style="s2">people next you know if I have this now</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.499" end="00:10:21.709" style="s2">there&#39;s always exceptions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.149" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">like little breakout things that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.709" end="00:10:27.290" style="s2">never expected to do well but for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:30.410" style="s2">most part they&#39;re designing things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.290" end="00:10:32.929" style="s2">will just sell the most and so yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.410" end="00:10:37.489" style="s2">you think of what advertisement am I</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.929" end="00:10:41.019" style="s2">gonna see for the next show that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.489" end="00:10:44.809" style="s2">coming up whatever that might be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.019" end="00:10:48.129" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like lobbyists or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.809" end="00:10:50.419" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re they&#39;re not heavily</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.129" end="00:10:53.809" style="s2">advertising things that are important</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.419" end="00:10:55.339" style="s2">and things that actually like would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.809" end="00:10:57.859" style="s2">good for people they&#39;re heavily</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.339" end="00:11:06.199" style="s2">advertising like keeping the status quo</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.859" end="00:11:08.010" style="s2">going pandering to consumption and all</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.199" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.010" end="00:11:12.780" style="s2">cultural tropes that we might think are</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:16.680" style="s2">no longer helpful but they like</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.780" end="00:11:18.930" style="s2">romanticize these things status and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.680" end="00:11:21.330" style="s2">wealth and was I thinking about a couple</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.930" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">years ago how like Daniel I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.330" end="00:11:24.810" style="s2">so I just want to give a shout time you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">share before we go on to the next the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.810" end="00:11:27.330" style="s2">next portion and then we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:28.980" style="s2">little bit more of an open conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.330" end="00:11:31.560" style="s2">about what&#39;s currently going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.980" end="00:11:32.550" style="s2">media Charlie would you or do want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.560" end="00:11:36.900" style="s2">give you the opportunity you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.550" end="00:11:39.030" style="s2">to okay um I guess I have a couple quick</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.900" end="00:11:43.380" style="s2">stories I&#39;ll try to make it really short</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.030" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">um I I know I&#39;m not an expert or</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.380" end="00:11:47.790" style="s2">anything but I know there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:50.100" style="s2">be said like our brains can&#39;t tell the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.790" end="00:11:52.170" style="s2">difference between what we see and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.100" end="00:11:54.300" style="s2">we&#39;re really experiencing so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.170" end="00:11:57.240" style="s2">something very powerful in that and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.300" end="00:11:59.700" style="s2">just wanted to share like two things in</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.240" end="00:12:02.700" style="s2">my life that I the first one I remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.700" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">was I used to watch I don&#39;t know tons of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.700" end="00:12:05.700" style="s2">cartoons and there&#39;d always be somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.290" end="00:12:07.560" style="s2">that was like running around with a bat</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.700" end="00:12:09.800" style="s2">and hitting somebody else on the head or</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.560" end="00:12:12.030" style="s2">like a log or something like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.800" end="00:12:14.910" style="s2">remember being at a friend&#39;s house and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.030" end="00:12:17.400" style="s2">was I don&#39;t know maybe five kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.910" end="00:12:19.650" style="s2">young and their dad had just come home</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.400" end="00:12:21.840" style="s2">from crab fishing so he&#39;d been gone for</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.650" end="00:12:24.330" style="s2">months and everyone was excited it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.840" end="00:12:26.370" style="s2">kind of a party and we were running</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.330" end="00:12:28.140" style="s2">around the house and he was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.370" end="00:12:30.060" style="s2">chasing us and I remember I grabbed a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.140" end="00:12:32.190" style="s2">bat and got up on this top of a dresser</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.060" end="00:12:34.770" style="s2">and waited till he came in the door and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.190" end="00:12:38.730" style="s2">I whacked him on the head I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.770" end="00:12:40.650" style="s2">was hilarious and it wasn&#39;t and people</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.730" end="00:12:42.750" style="s2">got really pissed off and I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.650" end="00:12:45.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t have I couldn&#39;t understand why it</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.750" end="00:12:47.490" style="s2">wasn&#39;t funny when I did it and that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.720" end="00:12:50.490" style="s2">maybe my first time I realized oh like</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.490" end="00:12:52.260" style="s2">things are a little like not really what</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.490" end="00:12:53.970" style="s2">you believe but as a child you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.260" end="00:12:57.380" style="s2">don&#39;t have that discernment so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.970" end="00:13:00.440" style="s2">really points to all the advertising</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.380" end="00:13:02.790" style="s2">around children right now just really</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.440" end="00:13:05.700" style="s2">terrible and a lot of it is does go to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.790" end="00:13:07.620" style="s2">this waste or overconsumption idea so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.700" end="00:13:11.340" style="s2">start there really young teaching them</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.620" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">about things that I don&#39;t know just</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.340" end="00:13:15.150" style="s2">there is no inner there&#39;s no connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.230" end="00:13:16.710" style="s2">with what they&#39;re seeing but they</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.150" end="00:13:19.620" style="s2">definitely want these things because</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.710" end="00:13:21.870" style="s2">they look so desirable my second thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.620" end="00:13:26.279" style="s2">is I was much older</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.870" end="00:13:29.370" style="s2">and I was working in a French spa and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.279" end="00:13:34.920" style="s2">in 2000 there was a it was an election</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.370" end="00:13:37.260" style="s2">year and I remember working in the print</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.920" end="00:13:40.380" style="s2">shop it&#39;s dealing with these politicians</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.260" end="00:13:42.180" style="s2">that would come in and want me to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.380" end="00:13:43.620" style="s2">these pamphlets Daniel you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.180" end="00:13:46.950" style="s2">about there&#39;s different types of media</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.620" end="00:13:49.020" style="s2">so this is print and they would come in</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.950" end="00:13:50.730" style="s2">and they wouldn&#39;t want me to make these</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.020" end="00:13:53.460" style="s2">pamphlets it&#39;s just showing how great</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.730" end="00:13:54.690" style="s2">they are family people great values but</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.460" end="00:13:59.310" style="s2">they&#39;re real assholes</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.690" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">and I&#39;m empathic very in tune to how</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.310" end="00:14:04.440" style="s2">people&#39;s real personality is and it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:06.330" style="s2">so like it went on I don&#39;t know eight</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.440" end="00:14:07.589" style="s2">months or something of this political</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.330" end="00:14:10.260" style="s2">season we&#39;re making all this political</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.589" end="00:14:13.170" style="s2">advertising and a war on me so much I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.260" end="00:14:14.970" style="s2">felt like this was just a propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.170" end="00:14:16.830" style="s2">machine and we were just a regular print</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.970" end="00:14:19.350" style="s2">shop but we did get because we were a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.830" end="00:14:21.810" style="s2">union shop we said their reunion but we</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.350" end="00:14:23.100" style="s2">really weren&#39;t yet we got a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.810" end="00:14:25.860" style="s2">politicians because they wanted that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.100" end="00:14:28.410" style="s2">Union bug on their flyers and it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.860" end="00:14:29.880" style="s2">drastic to meet these people and then to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.410" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">see their flyers coming to me in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.880" end="00:14:33.750" style="s2">mail and how much money they spend on it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:36.870" style="s2">just outrageous amounts of money of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.750" end="00:14:39.029" style="s2">advertising and it felt like straight</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.870" end="00:14:40.920" style="s2">lies it just did not feel like who this</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.029" end="00:14:43.800" style="s2">person really was so those are my two</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.920" end="00:14:45.959" style="s2">kind of media things that come up for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.800" end="00:14:49.140" style="s2">right now and I will let us move on to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.959" end="00:14:51.510" style="s2">the next one yeah so that was like</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.140" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">perfect timing 50 minute mark so now we</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.510" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">move on to the part where we can each</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:56.580" style="s2">talk about what we would like it to look</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:57.300" style="s2">like so it&#39;s specifically media and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.580" end="00:15:00.089" style="s2">entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.300" end="00:15:02.730" style="s2">what would the entertainment sector of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.089" end="00:15:05.070" style="s2">the media look like in five ten a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.730" end="00:15:07.170" style="s2">hundred years under your ideal world and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.070" end="00:15:08.550" style="s2">our visions in no way need to match they</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.170" end="00:15:09.720" style="s2">don&#39;t need to counteract er but if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.550" end="00:15:12.270" style="s2">want to add on someone else&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.720" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">able to after they share but what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.270" end="00:15:18.500" style="s2">your version of entertainment look like</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:22.190" style="s2">in however long and good to look like I</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.500" end="00:15:25.110" style="s2">I have a story to kick this off with</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.190" end="00:15:27.420" style="s2">when I was god I must have been about</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.110" end="00:15:29.459" style="s2">ten years old something like that when</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.420" end="00:15:32.250" style="s2">the first Star Wars movie came out right</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.459" end="00:15:34.350" style="s2">and like a lot of other kids of my age</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.250" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">and older and my parents and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.350" end="00:15:38.460" style="s2">some other adults I completely fell in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:39.960" style="s2">love with this film right</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.460" end="00:15:41.700" style="s2">and then there was Empire Strikes Back</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.960" end="00:15:43.890" style="s2">which was even better than The Return of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.700" end="00:15:45.150" style="s2">the Jedi knew it wasn&#39;t as good as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.890" end="00:15:47.670" style="s2">first see but it was still you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.150" end="00:15:49.170" style="s2">still liked it I was a bit older didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.670" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">like the Ewoks that much blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.170" end="00:15:54.690" style="s2">but anyway that franchise obviously is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.490" end="00:15:56.430" style="s2">one of the biggest in movie history</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.690" end="00:16:00.030" style="s2">right in fact was the biggest until</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.430" end="00:16:02.070" style="s2">Marvel came along and they went on to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.030" end="00:16:04.740" style="s2">make the three prequels which were</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.070" end="00:16:06.750" style="s2">dreadful and then part seven eight and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.740" end="00:16:11.100" style="s2">nine which set new standards in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.750" end="00:16:12.990" style="s2">unintelligible follow and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.100" end="00:16:15.300" style="s2">spin-offs right there&#39;s the Mandalorian</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:17.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s the cartoons and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.300" end="00:16:19.170" style="s2">pinball machines and bla bla bla bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.880" end="00:16:22.230" style="s2">bla bla bla bla I mean this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.170" end="00:16:23.940" style="s2">giant business right so anyway what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.230" end="00:16:25.620" style="s2">driving at with all this is sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.940" end="00:16:28.490" style="s2">a rant right but it&#39;s actually not what</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.620" end="00:16:31.110" style="s2">I&#39;m driving at with all of this is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.490" end="00:16:33.030" style="s2">entertainment and I know we&#39;re focusing</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.110" end="00:16:34.740" style="s2">particularly on entertainment right</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.030" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">rather than information that&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.740" end="00:16:39.210" style="s2">one right and so the end I think to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:41.190" style="s2">certain extent they&#39;re inseparable from</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.210" end="00:16:44.370" style="s2">each other right but but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.190" end="00:16:45.660" style="s2">another conversation the media the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.370" end="00:16:48.080" style="s2">entertainment industry of the future</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.660" end="00:16:50.910" style="s2">would look like an environment in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.080" end="00:16:53.820" style="s2">people made films because because George</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.910" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">Lucas had storyboards for decades right</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.820" end="00:16:57.930" style="s2">I mean he had this story bouncing around</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:59.430" style="s2">his head but literally decades before he</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.930" end="00:17:01.800" style="s2">finally managed it you know it was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.430" end="00:17:03.660" style="s2">labor of love it was a and so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.800" end="00:17:07.940" style="s2">industry needs to be that right people</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.660" end="00:17:10.230" style="s2">producing stuff from that and not as</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.940" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">straightaway happens look at the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.230" end="00:17:13.110" style="s2">right another brilliant film a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:15.240" style="s2">long-standing project right and there</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.110" end="00:17:17.250" style="s2">and then money came into it pressure to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.240" end="00:17:19.530" style="s2">make sequels didn&#39;t really have ideas</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.250" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">for sequels it was a standalone idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.530" end="00:17:22.530" style="s2">right and so they manufactured sequels</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:24.680" style="s2">in order to me there</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.530" end="00:17:27.240" style="s2">none of that would exist it would all be</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.680" end="00:17:29.580" style="s2">labors of blood engaged in with people</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.240" end="00:17:31.710" style="s2">and and and collaborated in by people</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.580" end="00:17:33.690" style="s2">who believed in the thing for the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.710" end="00:17:36.090" style="s2">not because of its commercial potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.690" end="00:17:38.280" style="s2">but believed in the thing for thing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.090" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it looks like now how</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.280" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">the you produced that I have no</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:45.550" style="s2">idea but that&#39;s that&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:47.590" style="s2">like all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.550" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">and I want to share I have thoughts that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.590" end="00:17:55.000" style="s2">boys happy for other people to go first</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:57.870" style="s2">if they want to alright I will go my</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.000" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2">version of an ideal entertainment media</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.870" end="00:18:02.770" style="s2">world would be one where anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.000" end="00:18:04.780" style="s2">create their own media that you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.770" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">access to the filming equipment you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.780" end="00:18:08.290" style="s2">access to creating the team so any story</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.230" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">equipment as well as the editing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.150" end="00:18:30.610" style="s2">every and everything else and on a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:33.070" style="s2">larger scale of what gets produced I</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.610" end="00:18:34.990" style="s2">want to be able to put my money in</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.350" end="00:18:49.660" style="s2">we&#39;re not getting going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.490" end="00:18:51.400" style="s2">previous one but this idea that media</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.660" end="00:18:53.140" style="s2">and information is very injured</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.400" end="00:18:54.760" style="s2">intertwined you can&#39;t actually have one</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.790" end="00:19:59.470" style="s2">actually want to watch it and you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.440" end="00:20:00.970" style="s2">I think you&#39;d have tons of content</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.470" end="00:20:02.409" style="s2">and then I want to know what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.970" end="00:20:04.330" style="s2">work for me what&#39;s gonna be up in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.409" end="00:20:07.900" style="s2">alignment with me if I like Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.330" end="00:20:09.340" style="s2">what else will I like if I like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.900" end="00:20:11.140" style="s2">just been refined just watched the great</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.340" end="00:20:12.340" style="s2">which got very bad reviews and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.140" end="00:20:14.770" style="s2">actually really liked it it was like</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.340" end="00:20:16.330" style="s2">Catherine the Great but in this that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.770" end="00:20:17.799" style="s2">time period but this time period it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.330" end="00:20:21.490" style="s2">mashed-up which I know some people hate</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.799" end="00:20:23.409" style="s2">so that would be my version of an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.490" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">media source is everyone has access to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.409" end="00:20:28.270" style="s2">it and yet</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:30.970" style="s2">together we can fund the more costly</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.270" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">ones both by public will of can we use</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.970" end="00:20:36.190" style="s2">the streets what gets films where is if</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:37.929" style="s2">you need the streets to be shut down to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.190" end="00:20:39.880" style="s2">film you&#39;re gonna need to get city</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.929" end="00:20:41.260" style="s2">rights which means we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.880" end="00:20:43.419" style="s2">priority which projects are most</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.260" end="00:20:45.909" style="s2">important and fun as an individual I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.419" end="00:20:47.530" style="s2">make any art I want and have get help</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.909" end="00:20:49.510" style="s2">creating those teams so that is what my</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.530" end="00:20:51.850" style="s2">version would look like and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.510" end="00:21:00.250" style="s2">have the right technology we could start</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.850" end="00:21:02.260" style="s2">that within five years Daniel or Shiloh</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.250" end="00:21:04.179" style="s2">would you like to share on what you what</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.260" end="00:21:06.309" style="s2">if that brought up anything this needs</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.179" end="00:21:10.450" style="s2">to be a whole brand vision or anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.309" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">feel like a little little thing I feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.450" end="00:21:14.710" style="s2">like I have to bow out to the people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:17.650" style="s2">spent some time thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.710" end="00:21:21.700" style="s2">topic like I&#39;ve done very little on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.650" end="00:21:25.150" style="s2">topic myself I really like that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.700" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">the library thing access to equipment</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.150" end="00:21:34.600" style="s2">for everyone that&#39;s pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:37.150" style="s2">funding something before it&#39;s made I</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.600" end="00:21:40.270" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve seen some examples of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.150" end="00:21:42.549" style="s2">like that so that&#39;s cool it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.270" end="00:21:47.080" style="s2">tricky because you have some talented</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.549" end="00:21:49.090" style="s2">people that like you know some things</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.080" end="00:21:53.380" style="s2">are hard to describe before they&#39;re made</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.090" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">like I loved the matrix could I could</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.380" end="00:21:56.830" style="s2">they have described that well enough for</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:21:58.570" style="s2">me to have funded it beforehand I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.830" end="00:22:00.340" style="s2">know but I think that&#39;s a cool idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.570" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">another thing that came in mind was like</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.340" end="00:22:06.280" style="s2">you know what if we had a system where</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:09.159" style="s2">like you know more proceeds from films</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.280" end="00:22:12.070" style="s2">went to causes like you knew oh if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.159" end="00:22:13.149" style="s2">seeing this film I had this idea that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.070" end="00:22:16.149" style="s2">was going</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.149" end="00:22:17.769" style="s2">um that the proceeds were going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.149" end="00:22:20.259" style="s2">something I cared about or you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.769" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">have like a theater that like show films</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.259" end="00:22:30.219" style="s2">in that way that might be a partial help</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:38.409" style="s2">I like some of the stuff I heard so far</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.219" end="00:22:41.219" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s it um I get to Jubilee I</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.409" end="00:22:44.710" style="s2">when I picture kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.219" end="00:22:47.049" style="s2">alternative media system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.710" end="00:22:49.539" style="s2">connected with people kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.049" end="00:22:53.229" style="s2">humanitarian like in my world it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.539" end="00:22:55.839" style="s2">humanitarian counterbalancing system to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.229" end="00:22:57.969" style="s2">capitalism so it is exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.839" end="00:23:00.789" style="s2">saying where we do have access to all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.969" end="00:23:05.229" style="s2">these types of things to make art and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.789" end="00:23:09.339" style="s2">media freely collectively but I really</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.229" end="00:23:13.059" style="s2">like the idea of like the meta currency</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.339" end="00:23:15.820" style="s2">showing these connections so we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.059" end="00:23:17.259" style="s2">of start to see what like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.820" end="00:23:19.479" style="s2">people don&#39;t really think about when</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.259" end="00:23:21.279" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing a coke can on TV that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.479" end="00:23:24.279" style="s2">it&#39;s triggering them to drink coke it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.279" end="00:23:26.169" style="s2">just because a lot of times media for us</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.279" end="00:23:28.509" style="s2">is a way to relax so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.169" end="00:23:29.889" style="s2">checking out we&#39;re kind of like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.509" end="00:23:31.419" style="s2">want to have to think anymore and when</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.889" end="00:23:34.059" style="s2">we&#39;re being triggered by things like</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.419" end="00:23:36.039" style="s2">that it&#39;d be really cool to see a system</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.059" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">that shows like you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.039" end="00:23:41.889" style="s2">positive stuff and triggers us to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:45.219" style="s2">more recycling or just be more creative</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.889" end="00:23:50.289" style="s2">in our ways of being sustainable and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.219" end="00:23:53.320" style="s2">having a way to show that in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.289" end="00:23:56.259" style="s2">currency so I don&#39;t know you guys</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.320" end="00:23:58.779" style="s2">watched some of Raymond&#39;s um more recent</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.259" end="00:24:02.529" style="s2">videos but there was somebody on his one</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.779" end="00:24:04.479" style="s2">of his calls that I think I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.529" end="00:24:09.129" style="s2">really butchering it but I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.479" end="00:24:10.330" style="s2">like a media positive media type company</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.129" end="00:24:12.549" style="s2">then they&#39;re trying to get these</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.330" end="00:24:15.639" style="s2">positive things out but also gang I</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.549" end="00:24:18.330" style="s2">really like what you said about like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.639" end="00:24:21.129" style="s2">theater that&#39;s dedicated to these more</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.330" end="00:24:25.610" style="s2">positive works or works that are going</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.129" end="00:24:27.530" style="s2">to stimulate us in a way that&#39;s positive</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.610" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">humanity I think that&#39;s super cool too</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.530" end="00:24:36.170" style="s2">yeah I will just think I wanted one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:38.120" style="s2">the things I would like to see in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.170" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">future and starting to happen out like</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.120" end="00:24:45.230" style="s2">the diversity in the sex that&#39;s in media</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:47.690" style="s2">and the main characters that are in</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.230" end="00:24:50.210" style="s2">media those things are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.690" end="00:24:52.160" style="s2">like when when queer people were first</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.210" end="00:24:53.809" style="s2">more often in the limelight their</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.160" end="00:24:55.130" style="s2">secondary roles right it&#39;s the same with</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.809" end="00:24:57.110" style="s2">people with disabilities unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.130" end="00:24:58.730" style="s2">focused on your disability story you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.110" end="00:25:02.750" style="s2">not a main character right unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.730" end="00:25:05.090" style="s2">focusing on your emergence into being</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.750" end="00:25:06.620" style="s2">the hero or heroine you don&#39;t get to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.090" end="00:25:08.630" style="s2">the hero or heroine and then because</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.620" end="00:25:11.510" style="s2">life imitates art were attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.630" end="00:25:13.400" style="s2">people that look like the leading roles</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.510" end="00:25:17.179" style="s2">and the more we have new people in those</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.400" end="00:25:18.950" style="s2">leading roles the more our diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.179" end="00:25:21.470" style="s2">Attraction opens and then with things</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.950" end="00:25:23.630" style="s2">like consents and things like even like</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.470" end="00:25:25.610" style="s2">safe sex when they&#39;re not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.630" end="00:25:26.990" style="s2">media right when you just like kiss and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.610" end="00:25:28.130" style="s2">then you&#39;re laying in bed it&#39;s like wait</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.990" end="00:25:29.960" style="s2">what about the condom what about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.130" end="00:25:32.600" style="s2">awkward conversation what about the like</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.960" end="00:25:35.240" style="s2">you know like making consent sexy</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.600" end="00:25:35.690" style="s2">instead of the idea that oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.240" end="00:25:36.770" style="s2">boring</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.690" end="00:25:38.510" style="s2">well that right because we haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.770" end="00:25:39.890" style="s2">at movies as much you know I mean now</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.510" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">it&#39;s starting to get it and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.890" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">okay well this is actually that can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:47.870" style="s2">really sexy and having more of those</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:50.660" style="s2">conversations without it because then</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.870" end="00:25:52.669" style="s2">there&#39;s also the other side of like when</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.660" end="00:25:54.980" style="s2">I look at complex characters like Dexter</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.669" end="00:25:56.630" style="s2">and Nurse Jackie did they come about</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.980" end="00:25:59.660" style="s2">because we were ready for it as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.630" end="00:26:03.260" style="s2">society and therefore we&#39;re more complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.660" end="00:26:05.150" style="s2">or or did they allow us to accept like</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.260" end="00:26:07.820" style="s2">chicken or egg right what happens first</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.150" end="00:26:08.690" style="s2">like because 10 years before Dexter came</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.820" end="00:26:10.820" style="s2">out we wouldn&#39;t have been ready for</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:12.679" style="s2">Dexter and now even if Dexter came out</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.820" end="00:26:14.540" style="s2">again to be like a same ol single right</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.679" end="00:26:16.340" style="s2">like there&#39;s so many now but it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.540" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">becomes anyway I know anyone else have</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.340" end="00:26:20.150" style="s2">any thoughts and what they would like it</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:21.559" style="s2">to look like in the future with millions</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.150" end="00:26:22.820" style="s2">of dollars and everyone participating</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.559" end="00:26:28.130" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll get on to the town people</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.820" end="00:26:29.690" style="s2">who chase it possible I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.130" end="00:26:31.580" style="s2">push back a little bit but just before I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.690" end="00:26:33.140" style="s2">do I&#39;d really like the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.580" end="00:26:35.300" style="s2">libraries you know having having the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.140" end="00:26:36.580" style="s2">studios and the camera equipment and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.300" end="00:26:38.510" style="s2">audio equipment and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.580" end="00:26:39.710" style="s2">paintbrushes and canvases and</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.710" end="00:26:43.670" style="s2">there&#39;s just there for anyone to use</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.150" end="00:26:45.350" style="s2">along with access to instruction how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.670" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">improve all of that kind of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.350" end="00:26:50.330" style="s2">think that&#39;s all of that yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:52.160" style="s2">exactly how people who have labors of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.330" end="00:26:54.110" style="s2">love can can you know and but don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.160" end="00:26:55.370" style="s2">money so that Kenan Kenan can actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.110" end="00:26:56.930" style="s2">bring that into the world so I love all</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.370" end="00:27:01.340" style="s2">of that there&#39;s a couple of things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.930" end="00:27:03.890" style="s2">I said that I kind of like the idea but</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.340" end="00:27:06.110" style="s2">I also see problems with right so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.890" end="00:27:08.300" style="s2">idea of font text is a really good</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.110" end="00:27:10.010" style="s2">example right if you&#39;d put that out in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.300" end="00:27:11.720" style="s2">the world and sought funding for it what</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.010" end="00:27:14.900" style="s2">you want to make a you want to make a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.720" end="00:27:16.730" style="s2">you know like a serial killer</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.900" end="00:27:18.350" style="s2">violent serial killer you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.730" end="00:27:19.820" style="s2">in the hero of a show no way</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.350" end="00:27:21.530" style="s2">there&#39;s no way I&#39;m putting money into</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.820" end="00:27:23.540" style="s2">that right all of the righteous</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.530" end="00:27:25.280" style="s2">indignation would have come up and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.540" end="00:27:28.130" style="s2">no way that ever gets funded so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.280" end="00:27:30.050" style="s2">the notion of funding stuff from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.130" end="00:27:33.770" style="s2">eventual audience I think is I think is</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.050" end="00:27:35.660" style="s2">a I I think it really restricts the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.770" end="00:27:38.990" style="s2">possibility of what can be made right</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.660" end="00:27:40.310" style="s2">rather giving the people access but</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.990" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">either I just let them make what they</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.310" end="00:27:43.250" style="s2">want and then people like it and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">like it they don&#39;t like it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.250" end="00:27:47.990" style="s2">like it and let it be upregulated and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:49.310" style="s2">downregulated you know post-production I</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.990" end="00:27:53.870" style="s2">think there was there was one other</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.310" end="00:27:56.560" style="s2">thing as well the other thing no I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.870" end="00:28:01.370" style="s2">remember so kinda been that important</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.560" end="00:28:05.660" style="s2">are we still are - what well something</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.370" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">that comes to mind is this question that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.660" end="00:28:11.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve been studying over the past month</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:11.960" style="s2">and a half which is asking does this</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.210" end="00:28:14.900" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.960" end="00:28:19.580" style="s2">and I wonder if that&#39;s a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.900" end="00:28:21.770" style="s2">like set our compass on things I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.580" end="00:28:25.670" style="s2">he&#39;s like does the movie matter like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.770" end="00:28:27.980" style="s2">be made or whatever you&#39;re doing does it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.670" end="00:28:33.770" style="s2">matter so like I&#39;m sort of thinking for</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.980" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">instance like I care a lot about local</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.770" end="00:28:37.820" style="s2">gardening and like food security and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:39.730" style="s2">like why do we have all these lawns kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.820" end="00:28:43.970" style="s2">of thing and at least where I live and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.730" end="00:28:48.980" style="s2">so but people really love comedy so like</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.970" end="00:28:50.140" style="s2">you know and I I get that and so what if</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.980" end="00:28:54.430" style="s2">you had</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.140" end="00:28:56.440" style="s2">like a show that had all the comedic I</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.430" end="00:28:59.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know just silliness and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.440" end="00:29:04.540" style="s2">that people loved but you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.830" end="00:29:07.990" style="s2">okay what is the context that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.540" end="00:29:11.320" style="s2">do this in because that matters I could</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.990" end="00:29:13.270" style="s2">do a comedy show in any sort of context</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.320" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">you know sort of like a Cheers or</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:18.370" style="s2">surrounding a bar or surrounding her I</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:20.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know an office or an oil rig or</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.370" end="00:29:23.080" style="s2">whatever but what if I did a comedy show</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.560" end="00:29:26.290" style="s2">and I said okay so what matters people</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.080" end="00:29:28.630" style="s2">like comedy it&#39;s great sure fine what if</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.290" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">I surrounded it in like urban gardening</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.630" end="00:29:34.990" style="s2">and like there you go make it cool make</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.090" end="00:29:43.630" style="s2">it fun so I guess the what really</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.990" end="00:29:45.490" style="s2">matters here has helped me a compass and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.630" end="00:29:47.170" style="s2">to me that is part of the crowd funny</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.490" end="00:29:48.670" style="s2">beforehand but I also get what Eric is</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.170" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">saying I there&#39;s one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.670" end="00:29:52.300" style="s2">stories for hunger games before Hunger</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:54.430" style="s2">Games was making people like well well</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.300" end="00:29:56.260" style="s2">no one wants to watch a story about a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.430" end="00:29:57.850" style="s2">female lead that isn&#39;t all about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.260" end="00:29:59.800" style="s2">romance I mean yes there&#39;s romance in</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.850" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2">Hunger Games but it&#39;s and then it came</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.800" end="00:30:03.610" style="s2">out and it was blockbuster they were</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:05.380" style="s2">like oh actually women are half the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.610" end="00:30:07.120" style="s2">population and they also want to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.380" end="00:30:11.350" style="s2">themselves as heroes they also want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.120" end="00:30:13.090" style="s2">be the main character and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.350" end="00:30:15.700" style="s2">investors started and then there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.090" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">of female content that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.700" end="00:30:21.040" style="s2">character but as a woman I would have</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:22.690" style="s2">known I wanted to go see Katniss because</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.040" end="00:30:24.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve read the books so I would have</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.690" end="00:30:25.480" style="s2">funded Hunger Games for sure and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.070" end="00:30:26.770" style="s2">would the people who do the books and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.480" end="00:30:28.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount of the audience</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.770" end="00:30:30.100" style="s2">knowing but also it could have really</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.660" end="00:30:32.620" style="s2">been shitty right even though the books</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.100" end="00:30:34.060" style="s2">are good the movie itself it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.620" end="00:30:36.730" style="s2">time and time again there were it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.060" end="00:30:39.070" style="s2">bad right so it&#39;s it is it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.730" end="00:30:41.260" style="s2">you get good art necessarily know it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.070" end="00:30:42.820" style="s2">to be a new a new mechanism for not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.260" end="00:30:46.600" style="s2">what how do we fund it but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.820" end="00:30:48.760" style="s2">also get the best out there which might</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.600" end="00:30:51.250" style="s2">mean instead of what is it called in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.760" end="00:30:52.870" style="s2">Hollywood when you get a on a contract</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.250" end="00:30:54.970" style="s2">to make the film you have the option is</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.870" end="00:30:56.680" style="s2">it an option the option to make the film</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.970" end="00:30:58.690" style="s2">but instead of it being an option right</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.680" end="00:31:01.390" style="s2">I own the option for making Hunger Games</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.690" end="00:31:02.360" style="s2">that we say hey Hunger Games wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.390" end="00:31:05.150" style="s2">made and we want</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.120" end="00:31:11.060" style="s2">look like and then the people who like</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.560" end="00:31:12.890" style="s2">Hunger Games voting on which one they</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.060" end="00:31:14.300" style="s2">want to make the movie and then that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.890" end="00:31:15.680" style="s2">person makes the movie at least we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.300" end="00:31:18.500" style="s2">some amount of saying whether it fails</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.680" end="00:31:20.150" style="s2">or not all right and we are over time</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.500" end="00:31:21.320" style="s2">for getting onto my favorite portion</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.110" end="00:31:30.380" style="s2">because of what you were talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.370" end="00:31:33.320" style="s2">minute ago putting a TV opening a comedy</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.380" end="00:31:35.000" style="s2">in the context of there&#39;s a show a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.320" end="00:31:36.290" style="s2">button made by the BBC years and years</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.000" end="00:31:37.310" style="s2">ago it&#39;s decades old called The Good</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.290" end="00:31:39.770" style="s2">Life it&#39;s a really really excellent</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.310" end="00:31:41.420" style="s2">sitcom and it is exactly that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.770" end="00:31:43.430" style="s2">really good sitcom really nice character</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.420" end="00:31:45.680" style="s2">setting exactly that they leave their</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.430" end="00:31:48.170" style="s2">jobs and and use their garden to raise</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.680" end="00:31:49.910" style="s2">chickens and grow vegetables and and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.170" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">that and this was made 40 years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.910" end="00:31:52.730" style="s2">mean it was really ahead of its time and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.260" style="s2">it&#39;s an excellent show I highly</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.730" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">recommend watching it I put the plate up</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.260" end="00:32:00.200" style="s2">put a playlist in the chat window for</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">you nice and into what&#39;s currently on</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.200" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">Netflix there&#39;s more current one of two</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">people quitting their jobs and moving</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:08.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a comedy so just before we move on</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:11.030" style="s2">just that it&#39;s it&#39;s reads I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.420" end="00:32:13.700" style="s2">only fair to say that a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.030" end="00:32:15.320" style="s2">really really good stuff does get made</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.700" end="00:32:18.290" style="s2">in this world you know I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.320" end="00:32:20.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of really in all domains</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.290" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">of media entertainment there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.810" end="00:32:24.740" style="s2">really excellent stuff produced so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:26.240" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be forgotten the problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.740" end="00:32:29.090" style="s2">is that when something good is produced</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:31.040" style="s2">it&#39;s immediately captured by you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.090" end="00:32:33.470" style="s2">the animals wanting to feed off of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.040" end="00:32:34.670" style="s2">you know I mean it comes and becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.470" end="00:32:38.920" style="s2">something ugly</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.670" end="00:32:42.170" style="s2">so yes anyway let&#39;s move on all right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.920" end="00:32:43.970" style="s2">the adjacent possible so in the area of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.170" end="00:32:48.380" style="s2">entertainment and media what could</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.970" end="00:32:51.080" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 do to improve</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.380" end="00:32:53.510" style="s2">our media lives right our entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.080" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">lives for those 10,000 people not</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.510" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">necessarily the world or maybe those</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:58.970" style="s2">10,000 people are the filmmakers they</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.370" style="s2">can be in various groups of 10 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.970" end="00:33:03.950" style="s2">people but 10,000 people and $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.370" end="00:33:05.660" style="s2">what could we do with that you&#39;ll think</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.950" end="00:33:07.550" style="s2">Jubilee it&#39;s perfect I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.660" end="00:33:10.730" style="s2">actually perfect for that 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.550" end="00:33:13.190" style="s2">each to putting in $10 to buy $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.730" end="00:33:14.510" style="s2">worth of equipment $100,000 as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.190" end="00:33:15.070" style="s2">meaningful spend if you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.510" end="00:33:17.710" style="s2">buying all</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.070" end="00:33:19.419" style="s2">video equipment that is a meaningful you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.710" end="00:33:20.980" style="s2">can buy good stuff with that right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.419" end="00:33:23.889" style="s2">and the reasonable amount of it that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.980" end="00:33:26.289" style="s2">those 10,000 people could have access to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.889" end="00:33:27.700" style="s2">right so that you did they collectively</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.289" end="00:33:30.490" style="s2">have access to that which way they have</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.700" end="00:33:32.139" style="s2">collectively purchased simple I love it</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.490" end="00:33:34.389" style="s2">love that expect don&#39;t forget anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.139" end="00:33:36.309" style="s2">near enough money like 10,000 people put</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.389" end="00:33:37.990" style="s2">money $10 in to get access to equipment</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.309" end="00:33:39.580" style="s2">there&#39;s now 10,000 people who want that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.990" end="00:33:40.990" style="s2">equipment yeah but they don&#39;t all want</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.580" end="00:33:43.509" style="s2">it all at once that&#39;s the point right</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.990" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">they they own it collectively and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.509" end="00:33:50.139" style="s2">figure out some way of you know library</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:51.399" style="s2">yet yeah and and and I agree there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.139" end="00:33:52.600" style="s2">some logistical difficulties to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.399" end="00:33:54.820" style="s2">figured out but in principle I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.600" end="00:33:57.250" style="s2">absolutely think it works at that kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.820" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">of scale I think it does work what could</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.250" end="00:34:00.730" style="s2">happen well we could do with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.129" style="s2">thousand ten thousand is actually start</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.730" end="00:34:04.090" style="s2">a library with existing equipment</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.129" end="00:34:06.129" style="s2">meaning all the people who have this</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.090" end="00:34:08.109" style="s2">equipment like an Airbnb for khurana</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.129" end="00:34:10.149" style="s2">equipment right that you get rented out</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.109" end="00:34:12.819" style="s2">what that cost or you know like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.149" end="00:34:15.099" style="s2">broken it&#39;s insurance like Airbnb that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.819" end="00:34:16.929" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to use existing what</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.099" end="00:34:19.750" style="s2">people own and either they donate it for</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.929" end="00:34:21.849" style="s2">credit or they have it in the library</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.750" end="00:34:23.560" style="s2">system so they maybe have priority on</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.849" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">other equipment that they get to use but</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.560" end="00:34:26.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of equipment that just</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:27.310" style="s2">sits there and used because and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.200" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">maybe you have to have a certain skill</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.310" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">sets we will be use that equipment right</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:33.099" style="s2">when you&#39;re starting you&#39;re using like</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:35.500" style="s2">the very durable maybe not so great but</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.099" end="00:34:38.319" style="s2">as you prove your your skills you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.500" end="00:34:41.460" style="s2">and your skill more likely less in film</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.319" end="00:34:43.899" style="s2">and morning not breaking it right boring</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.460" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">not ruining the equipment for the for</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.899" end="00:34:50.550" style="s2">the rest of the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:53.580" style="s2">I think there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.550" end="00:34:56.280" style="s2">so something what is it called the test</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.580" end="00:34:59.310" style="s2">the black something test it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.280" end="00:35:01.290" style="s2">a feminine it&#39;s due to I think after</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.310" end="00:35:03.840" style="s2">this easy due to women talk in the movie</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.290" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">on something other than men to women</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.840" end="00:35:07.320" style="s2">talking to each other man could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.900" style="s2">presence or not they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.320" end="00:35:12.450" style="s2">something other than a man that is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.900" end="00:35:15.000" style="s2">BLET role test or whatever and very few</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.450" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">movies toss it that is how sad it is but</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.000" end="00:35:22.770" style="s2">having some something like that with</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:24.930" style="s2">every movie every script this been made</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.770" end="00:35:26.370" style="s2">having it show right what are the white</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.930" end="00:35:27.630" style="s2">people say versus the black people what</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.370" end="00:35:29.790" style="s2">are the females and the males but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.630" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">like just even having that catalog now</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.790" end="00:35:34.500" style="s2">could we do that for $100,000 I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:36.210" style="s2">know we really like movies people like</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.500" end="00:35:39.660" style="s2">writing them out the scripts already</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.210" end="00:35:41.220" style="s2">available right so maybe it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.660" end="00:35:46.890" style="s2">there it&#39;s just about creating the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.220" end="00:35:49.170" style="s2">robot that doesn&#39;t because then I also</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.890" end="00:35:52.200" style="s2">have access to if I do want queer</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.170" end="00:35:54.150" style="s2">contents right here all the gay</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.200" end="00:35:55.530" style="s2">characters and gay people may have said</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.150" end="00:35:56.850" style="s2">yes I like this one and not this one</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.530" end="00:35:58.920" style="s2">right this is a good representation this</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.850" end="00:36:01.020" style="s2">is a bad representation I want to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.920" end="00:36:03.210" style="s2">somebody in a movie who has autism but</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.020" end="00:36:06.450" style="s2">actually has autism right like the actor</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.210" end="00:36:07.980" style="s2">has autism different than like um Wayne</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.450" end="00:36:09.110" style="s2">man who played Rain Man right he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.980" end="00:36:11.730" style="s2">he&#39;s not autistic</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.110" end="00:36:13.740" style="s2">thank you that there is like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.730" end="00:36:15.600" style="s2">different right Rain Man is a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.740" end="00:36:18.030" style="s2">important movie but not if it was made</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.600" end="00:36:19.830" style="s2">today it would be actually it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.030" end="00:36:22.860" style="s2">happens all the time not autistic actors</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.830" end="00:36:25.650" style="s2">play autistic people all the time but to</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.860" end="00:36:29.300" style="s2">be able to find that content within what</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.650" end="00:36:29.300" style="s2">exists how do I find mine</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.670" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">knowing what projects so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.230" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">three different projects a Kickstarter</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:39.510" style="s2">type thing for movies of hey I have this</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:41.369" style="s2">thing how do i fund it how do we get the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.510" end="00:36:44.970" style="s2">cost down how do we coordinate on and if</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.369" end="00:36:51.450" style="s2">we want it to actually be made sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.970" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">equipment I&#39;m gonna say just in my</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.450" end="00:36:57.420" style="s2">perfect world um we do have hubs in</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:37:00.599" style="s2">every community that are like our</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.420" end="00:37:05.730" style="s2">community centers or really the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.599" end="00:37:08.819" style="s2">so I do think if we eventually have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.730" end="00:37:11.309" style="s2">Commons as a valued resource and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.819" end="00:37:13.319" style="s2">actually value it we would have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.309" end="00:37:17.130" style="s2">possibility to have these types of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.319" end="00:37:19.650" style="s2">libraries in every community and in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.130" end="00:37:21.270" style="s2">ways people could donate their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.650" end="00:37:23.819" style="s2">that they have maybe you have stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.270" end="00:37:25.770" style="s2">and then people can learn on it but also</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.819" end="00:37:27.510" style="s2">you could do fundraisers to improve</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.770" end="00:37:30.630" style="s2">those libraries if you&#39;re getting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.510" end="00:37:32.990" style="s2">of use out of them but by using using it</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.630" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">as a value system within your community</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.990" end="00:37:38.670" style="s2">you could see the interconnectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:42.599" style="s2">how the arts really enhance our lives</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.670" end="00:37:46.020" style="s2">and I think that would also lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.599" end="00:37:48.150" style="s2">lot less sex in movies and I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.020" end="00:37:50.099" style="s2">sounding very old and nasty because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.150" end="00:37:52.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s just too much there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.099" end="00:37:54.630" style="s2">much I feel so uncomfortable and I have</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.410" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">friends with young kids they can&#39;t watch</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.630" end="00:37:59.640" style="s2">a movie without it being uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:01.530" style="s2">because there&#39;s like just so much sex in</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.640" end="00:38:05.339" style="s2">your face and it feels like it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.530" end="00:38:07.140" style="s2">of these perverts in Hollywood or</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.339" end="00:38:10.770" style="s2">whatever that are directing or producing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.140" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">all this content for more of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.770" end="00:38:18.210" style="s2">activity and I just feel like if it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:20.369" style="s2">if we had our hubs and we had these</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.210" end="00:38:23.460" style="s2">types of media libraries and it was more</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.369" end="00:38:25.140" style="s2">like you have to be at least you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.460" end="00:38:26.940" style="s2">have to be but a lot of the content</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.140" end="00:38:29.400" style="s2">would be more family-friendly because</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.940" end="00:38:36.299" style="s2">people in families were participating in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.400" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">making it my little something a poke no</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.299" end="00:38:42.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a media for kids where especially</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:44.819" style="s2">LGBT content because all the parents</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.990" end="00:38:47.090" style="s2">that are up in arms about like how dare</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.819" end="00:38:50.250" style="s2">you have two moms right</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.090" end="00:38:52.410" style="s2">finding dory has two women pushing a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.250" end="00:38:54.869" style="s2">carriage in Central Park that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.410" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">neither in the background they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.869" end="00:38:58.500" style="s2">freaking out like you know your main</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:39:01.320" style="s2">character as a lesbian right like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.500" end="00:39:03.240" style="s2">actress but whatever that there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.320" end="00:39:06.600" style="s2">parents who are LGBT and have kids who</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.240" end="00:39:08.609" style="s2">are LGBTQ plus that we can fund that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.600" end="00:39:10.680" style="s2">like who cares what if Pixar and Disney</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.609" end="00:39:14.250" style="s2">make it can we make it but then it</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.680" end="00:39:16.500" style="s2">becomes like I don&#39;t know bad media like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.250" end="00:39:19.380" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like if you create queer</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.500" end="00:39:20.790" style="s2">content for kids it&#39;s gonna be bad queer</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.380" end="00:39:21.210" style="s2">content for kids but that&#39;s ok I&#39;m ok</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.790" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.210" end="00:39:28.680" style="s2">I&#39;d rather bad pure content they know</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">queer content but my eventual goal I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.680" end="00:39:35.070" style="s2">want to be able to have the like it not</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:37.109" style="s2">to be a big deal right have heroes that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.070" end="00:39:39.060" style="s2">are every ability and every look and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.109" end="00:39:42.210" style="s2">every and have and have it be no big</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.060" end="00:39:44.700" style="s2">deal not this up in arms oh my god you</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.210" end="00:39:48.030" style="s2">you had a autistic person be the main</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.700" end="00:39:49.590" style="s2">the main character yeah cuz I&#39;m autistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.030" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">and I&#39;m the main character in my life</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.590" end="00:39:57.810" style="s2">you know my place I could direct roles a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:40:02.580" style="s2">lot of the time to both I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.810" end="00:40:06.900" style="s2">kind of the key for like having that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.580" end="00:40:10.230" style="s2">equity of access to things is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.900" end="00:40:12.990" style="s2">library or Commons just say the live you</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.230" end="00:40:17.609" style="s2">know your film library for equipment is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.990" end="00:40:19.980" style="s2">not they don&#39;t have a voice in what gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.609" end="00:40:23.250" style="s2">made they&#39;re just giving the equipment</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.980" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">and like so you know because you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.250" end="00:40:27.090" style="s2">different opinions on all these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:31.250" style="s2">you know what you know right or wrong or</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.090" end="00:40:35.850" style="s2">whatever like that&#39;s just a fact but</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.250" end="00:40:37.940" style="s2">you&#39;re you know the the library can lend</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.850" end="00:40:41.880" style="s2">these things out but isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.940" end="00:40:46.220" style="s2">contributing to producing or profiting</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.880" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">from whatever gets made you know I could</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.220" end="00:40:52.200" style="s2">you you know someone could take that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:56.369" style="s2">equipment when it&#39;s their turn and make</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.200" end="00:40:58.290" style="s2">something that you know was I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.369" end="00:40:59.680" style="s2">more traditional or something and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.290" end="00:41:01.569" style="s2">could be like all it didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:04.089" style="s2">have enough of this type of diversity</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.569" end="00:41:12.490" style="s2">but you know that&#39;s on them it&#39;s not on</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.089" end="00:41:14.890" style="s2">the library so I think that is like when</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.490" end="00:41:16.270" style="s2">we make media for profit somebody in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.890" end="00:41:19.270" style="s2">boardroom decides it it&#39;s for profit</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.270" end="00:41:20.859" style="s2">right is is the lead character white</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.270" end="00:41:22.510" style="s2">male and able-bodied then we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.859" end="00:41:25.150" style="s2">possibly make this right</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.510" end="00:41:27.819" style="s2">no it&#39;s gonna be bare as we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.150" end="00:41:29.710" style="s2">world right so if we are making it I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.819" end="00:41:30.790" style="s2">could choose to make a white male</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.710" end="00:41:32.680" style="s2">character because I think it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.790" end="00:41:34.210" style="s2">more profitable but it&#39;s not gonna be my</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.680" end="00:41:35.980" style="s2">art it&#39;s not gonna be touching my heart</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.210" end="00:41:37.809" style="s2">and telling my story and do you that so</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.980" end="00:41:39.790" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be kind of crap whereas if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.809" end="00:41:41.650" style="s2">can tell my story writer the stories</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.790" end="00:41:43.030" style="s2">that are more similar to mine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.650" end="00:41:44.680" style="s2">going to be more diversity out there so</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.030" end="00:41:46.630" style="s2">I like the idea of allowing people to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.680" end="00:41:49.420" style="s2">create their own will learn and not</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.630" end="00:41:52.930" style="s2">putting restrictions on that what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.420" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">done is because we&#39;re afraid to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.930" end="00:41:56.619" style="s2">anything radical or that seems</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:58.960" style="s2">impossible like I&#39;m talking about where</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.619" end="00:42:04.420" style="s2">the big money is we&#39;ve kind of distilled</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.960" end="00:42:07.809" style="s2">things down to be relatively safe in all</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.420" end="00:42:13.480" style="s2">these different realms like in on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.809" end="00:42:15.069" style="s2">sex stuff or the non sex stuff or I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.480" end="00:42:17.470" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of things about</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.069" end="00:42:22.990" style="s2">violence and we push the edge on that as</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.470" end="00:42:26.140" style="s2">well so but if you have it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.990" end="00:42:28.569" style="s2">like if you have an opinion that Mike</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.140" end="00:42:29.890" style="s2">could get people riled up</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.569" end="00:42:32.170" style="s2">but you&#39;ve got to just go with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.890" end="00:42:33.910" style="s2">lowest common denominator and just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.170" end="00:42:36.309" style="s2">keep putting out superhero movies</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.910" end="00:42:39.940" style="s2">because like not likely to offend</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.309" end="00:42:45.220" style="s2">anybody with that I know some people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.940" end="00:42:47.859" style="s2">are in there in Christian filmmaking and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.220" end="00:42:49.869" style="s2">like so even that side you know they</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.859" end="00:42:55.000" style="s2">can&#39;t was very hard for them to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.869" end="00:42:57.130" style="s2">traction on funding or advertising mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:42:58.869" style="s2">they they end up making their stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.130" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">they can&#39;t you know no one puts it on</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.869" end="00:43:06.369" style="s2">their platforms someone got something on</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:08.380" style="s2">Amazon Prime and so like I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.369" end="00:43:11.500" style="s2">say whether I agree or disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.380" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">like the views that they&#39;re saying they</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.500" end="00:43:15.260" style="s2">have in their films</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:18.980" style="s2">but it&#39;s same kind of thing it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.260" end="00:43:21.110" style="s2">touchy and so they have so then you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.980" end="00:43:23.900" style="s2">these networks that I don&#39;t know like if</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.110" end="00:43:27.980" style="s2">there&#39;s LGBT something like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.900" end="00:43:31.220" style="s2">networks but you know those folks the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.980" end="00:43:33.380" style="s2">they put together like what I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.220" end="00:43:35.330" style="s2">what it&#39;s called shine media or</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.380" end="00:43:38.180" style="s2">something&#39;s like Netflix just for</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.330" end="00:43:40.010" style="s2">Christian films $6.99 a month or</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.180" end="00:43:41.510" style="s2">something because like we can&#39;t get our</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.010" end="00:43:44.630" style="s2">stuff on that we just got to make our</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.510" end="00:43:49.580" style="s2">own dang platform for our for our people</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.630" end="00:43:51.140" style="s2">to put their stuff on and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.580" end="00:43:53.710" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen is we&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.140" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">continue to have more and more different</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.710" end="00:44:04.300" style="s2">platforms um is that like more echo</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:04.300" style="s2">chambers or something I don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.990" end="00:44:08.900" style="s2">for whatever is going on it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:11.780" style="s2">yeah we just keep going to the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.900" end="00:44:17.750" style="s2">common denominator because you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.780" end="00:44:19.550" style="s2">anything too exciting even even big</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.750" end="00:44:22.970" style="s2">companies that we know about like</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.550" end="00:44:26.270" style="s2">Jubilee you&#39;re mentioning you know a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.970" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">company like Disney or Pixar if they do</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.270" end="00:44:32.090" style="s2">something that is a little bit edgy</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:35.990" style="s2">pushing the envelope progressively I</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.090" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">mean gosh all they need is enough voices</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.990" end="00:44:41.270" style="s2">to say we&#39;re gonna stop we&#39;re gonna drop</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">your your subscription or you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.270" end="00:44:46.100" style="s2">not gonna like it doesn&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:48.470" style="s2">be in every single film but you want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.100" end="00:44:50.180" style="s2">make one film that has a message and all</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.470" end="00:44:52.670" style="s2">of a sudden you&#39;ve got people saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.180" end="00:44:54.830" style="s2">your whole company is like this and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.670" end="00:45:00.190" style="s2">can&#39;t support you and whatever and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.830" end="00:45:03.050" style="s2">like companies are afraid to lose I</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.190" end="00:45:05.540" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is well like lose</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.050" end="00:45:07.550" style="s2">subscribers or something but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.540" end="00:45:11.000" style="s2">they&#39;re fan based or they&#39;re very loyal</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.550" end="00:45:12.740" style="s2">fanbase they don&#39;t want to risk risk</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.000" end="00:45:14.660" style="s2">profit what are the other things coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.740" end="00:45:17.480" style="s2">up we&#39;re talking is there&#39;s a sweb site</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.660" end="00:45:19.340" style="s2">that exists it&#39;s called the Common Sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.480" end="00:45:21.950" style="s2">Media go to it all the time for kids</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.340" end="00:45:23.840" style="s2">it&#39;s about kids it&#39;s it&#39;s what do adults</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.950" end="00:45:25.250" style="s2">say is the age you should watch this on</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.840" end="00:45:26.430" style="s2">what do kids say is the age you should</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.250" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">watch this arm then it talks</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.430" end="00:45:30.329" style="s2">sex and violence and we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">everything else and so it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.329" end="00:45:34.260" style="s2">find things that are suitable for your</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:38.369" style="s2">family having something like that for</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.260" end="00:45:40.710" style="s2">all media where it isn&#39;t about like if</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.369" end="00:45:42.690" style="s2">you have a trigger warning for your own</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.710" end="00:45:44.670" style="s2">personal self here are the parts to skip</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.690" end="00:45:45.990" style="s2">and if you skip this part here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.670" end="00:45:48.230" style="s2">you need to know from it right like</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.990" end="00:45:50.220" style="s2">therefore you could say okay well well</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.230" end="00:45:51.150" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna see any of the sex</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.220" end="00:45:52.829" style="s2">scenes right you&#39;re not gonna see any</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.150" end="00:45:54.540" style="s2">violence or in my kids case you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.829" end="00:45:55.890" style="s2">handle violence but not blood so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.540" end="00:45:58.380" style="s2">like knowing when there&#39;s gonna be blood</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.890" end="00:46:00.119" style="s2">and and shutting her eyes or you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.380" end="00:46:01.980" style="s2">just skipping those parts well still</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.119" end="00:46:04.829" style="s2">getting the plot points could help</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.980" end="00:46:06.690" style="s2">people still is that you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.829" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">like I don&#39;t need everyone so don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.380" end="00:46:32.190" style="s2">the whole movie just like these certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.270" end="00:46:34.829" style="s2">things that push that envelope for me on</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.190" end="00:46:37.260" style="s2">gore and like just take that out is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.829" end="00:46:39.450" style="s2">okay that&#39;d be like a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.260" end="00:46:40.890" style="s2">solution I know how you do it but and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.450" end="00:46:42.390" style="s2">you know it&#39;s happening right because</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.890" end="00:46:43.559" style="s2">it&#39;s all you just like deleting scenes</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.559" end="00:46:47.880" style="s2">watching this scene and go to the next</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.170" end="00:46:50.220" style="s2">one and the more technology it would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.880" end="00:46:53.540" style="s2">more just information of where you skip</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.220" end="00:46:53.540" style="s2">go from this point to this point</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.089" end="00:47:01.559" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.270" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">excuse me right along with this</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.559" end="00:47:05.790" style="s2">technology comes the ability for other</p>

<p begin="00:47:05.790" end="00:47:09.180" style="s2">the scenes with black people in or I</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.180" end="00:47:21.510" style="s2">and and so I I&#39;m not sure because life</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.900" end="00:47:23.849" style="s2">does contain violence and sex and gore</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.510" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">and blood sometimes you know and and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.849" end="00:47:28.470" style="s2">exclude it in all cases</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:30.270" style="s2">I agree there&#39;s too much of it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.470" end="00:47:32.970" style="s2">not disputing that at all that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.270" end="00:47:34.770" style="s2">routier Thyssen is way too often use I</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.970" end="00:47:37.380" style="s2">that I&#39;m not arguing for a second</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.770" end="00:47:38.430" style="s2">however to eliminate it completely to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.380" end="00:47:40.349" style="s2">have a bit of software that would</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.430" end="00:47:42.630" style="s2">eliminate all traces</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.349" end="00:47:44.339" style="s2">that which you do not wish to see from</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.630" end="00:47:45.569" style="s2">from from your feet I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.339" end="00:47:46.819" style="s2">think that&#39;s healthy I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.569" end="00:47:50.009" style="s2">that&#39;s good either</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.819" end="00:47:52.759" style="s2">it just helps with the idea that you get</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.009" end="00:47:55.259" style="s2">to cater your own right so you get a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.759" end="00:47:57.180" style="s2">change like Daniel saying they just as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.259" end="00:47:59.069" style="s2">self-created echo chamber and nothing</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.180" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">other than the fluffy beautiful things</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.069" end="00:48:02.220" style="s2">that you want to see in life and make it</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:04.410" style="s2">into your bubble you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.220" end="00:48:08.999" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not healthy I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.410" end="00:48:11.249" style="s2">anyway my dad that&#39;s okay but I also</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.999" end="00:48:13.349" style="s2">think it&#39;s like you have to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.249" end="00:48:15.269" style="s2">what you want and don&#39;t want right so if</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.349" end="00:48:16.890" style="s2">your own we&#39;re like why would you even</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.269" end="00:48:18.359" style="s2">put it I don&#39;t want black people in at</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.890" end="00:48:21.630" style="s2">all and you put that into the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.359" end="00:48:23.430" style="s2">and like what show is watchable that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.630" end="00:48:25.229" style="s2">made in the last 30 years right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.430" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">you&#39;re like all of these scenes aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.229" end="00:48:33.569" style="s2">in there you get the beginning and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:34.829" style="s2">credits that&#39;s it like it&#39;s not what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.569" end="00:48:38.789" style="s2">there left to watch when you take all</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.829" end="00:48:40.739" style="s2">the sec say well this is great you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.789" end="00:48:42.900" style="s2">not gonna watch those ones you know this</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.739" end="00:48:46.339" style="s2">is sort of related because sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.900" end="00:48:49.499" style="s2">have really great stories that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.339" end="00:48:53.400" style="s2">meaningful but the only way that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.499" end="00:48:56.819" style="s2">are able to get any traction in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.400" end="00:48:59.519" style="s2">population is to have these exciting</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.819" end="00:49:01.469" style="s2">things and so you have to have that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.519" end="00:49:04.769" style="s2">along with the story for anyone to even</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.469" end="00:49:07.469" style="s2">like put it in theaters that might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.769" end="00:49:11.489" style="s2">like a little bit more precise on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.469" end="00:49:13.650" style="s2">going on I mean like so let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.489" end="00:49:15.779" style="s2">just had a great wonderful meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.650" end="00:49:19.410" style="s2">story that could like actually help</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.779" end="00:49:22.109" style="s2">someone be encouraged or something but</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.410" end="00:49:24.989" style="s2">if you don&#39;t include some of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.109" end="00:49:27.509" style="s2">really edgy things which I&#39;m not like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.989" end="00:49:31.710" style="s2">mean I&#39;m pretty edgy like I like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.509" end="00:49:33.299" style="s2">thing but some people won&#39;t you know if</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.710" end="00:49:36.239" style="s2">you don&#39;t include them it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.299" end="00:49:38.489" style="s2">get traction in a larger world and like</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.239" end="00:49:39.989" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s part of the thing but to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.489" end="00:49:45.299" style="s2">back to the original problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.989" end="00:49:48.390" style="s2">$10,000 or $100,000 thing showing films</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.299" end="00:49:50.809" style="s2">that have a particular cause like there</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.390" end="00:49:53.980" style="s2">is another thing you could possibly do</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.809" end="00:49:55.330" style="s2">me and some friends we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.980" end="00:49:59.130" style="s2">we&#39;re throwing around the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.330" end="00:50:02.350" style="s2">starting a documentary Club at one point</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.130" end="00:50:04.750" style="s2">we didn&#39;t really have the space to do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.350" end="00:50:08.110" style="s2">but we had a lot of documentaries we all</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.750" end="00:50:10.570" style="s2">liked watching we did one showing at a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.110" end="00:50:12.310" style="s2">church that let us use their space and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.570" end="00:50:13.150" style="s2">we had like 20 people show up and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.310" end="00:50:16.150" style="s2">was pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.150" end="00:50:17.860" style="s2">and that was last year kind of want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.150" end="00:50:19.720" style="s2">do it again and now we&#39;re like in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.860" end="00:50:21.310" style="s2">pandemic and we&#39;re hoping to do another</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.720" end="00:50:23.170" style="s2">one in the spring but we thought man</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.310" end="00:50:25.300" style="s2">what if we had a space and we could like</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.170" end="00:50:27.850" style="s2">once a month we show a documentary and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.300" end="00:50:29.740" style="s2">like have people come and throw in five</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.850" end="00:50:33.310" style="s2">bucks if you got it if you don&#39;t hang</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.740" end="00:50:35.860" style="s2">out anyways have a little pizza whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.310" end="00:50:41.170" style="s2">you want to sustainably do I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.860" end="00:50:43.840" style="s2">but um that could be a fun way we did</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.170" end="00:50:44.980" style="s2">like a Q&amp;A thing afterwards so like it</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.840" end="00:50:47.140" style="s2">kind of got people a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.980" end="00:50:49.450" style="s2">connected what do you think let people</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.140" end="00:50:51.790" style="s2">just have a moment to agree or disagree</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.450" end="00:50:53.880" style="s2">and the documentary Club</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.790" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t know hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.880" end="00:51:07.870" style="s2">you commit by a building or rent space</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:09.190" style="s2">with that maybe in Toronto to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.870" end="00:51:11.560" style="s2">a cure anything yet the person but ya</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.190" end="00:51:12.760" style="s2">know having something like that words I</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.560" end="00:51:14.560" style="s2">mean they do that a co-hosting all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.760" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">time or their get a documentary and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.560" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">watch it together and then discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.630" style="s2">it&#39;s less of it but knowing when that</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:21.610" style="s2">was happening where you could go to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.630" end="00:51:24.160" style="s2">that right and each other having</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.610" end="00:51:26.110" style="s2">discussion around it it would be a cool</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.160" end="00:51:30.190" style="s2">tool for sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.110" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">how did like that - and I kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.190" end="00:51:34.750" style="s2">that as part of this new system arising</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:37.570" style="s2">with the Commons hopefully so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.750" end="00:51:40.210" style="s2">have to always buy a whole theater but</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.570" end="00:51:42.190" style="s2">we have space that we can schedule and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.210" end="00:51:44.710" style="s2">do that kind of thing but what I really</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.190" end="00:51:46.420" style="s2">like about and I probably doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.710" end="00:51:49.540" style="s2">into the hundred thousand dollars ten</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.420" end="00:51:53.170" style="s2">thousand people but if we do create this</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.540" end="00:51:55.750" style="s2">alternative value system we do then have</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.170" end="00:51:57.670" style="s2">the feedback loops that we need because</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.750" end="00:51:59.980" style="s2">we might think that we have to add all</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.670" end="00:52:01.390" style="s2">this violence and gore to our movies to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.980" end="00:52:02.830" style="s2">get people to watch it but maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.390" end="00:52:05.470" style="s2">just what they&#39;ve been telling us maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.830" end="00:52:07.069" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessarily true and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.470" end="00:52:09.349" style="s2">how they keep their funding and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.069" end="00:52:11.420" style="s2">how they get so maybe if we had more</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.349" end="00:52:14.569" style="s2">feedback loops about what we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.420" end="00:52:16.609" style="s2">watching and ways like I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.569" end="00:52:21.170" style="s2">like the sensory neither but if you had</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.609" end="00:52:22.999" style="s2">a way to I don&#39;t know vote on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.170" end="00:52:25.400" style="s2">that this has you know ninety percent</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.999" end="00:52:26.449" style="s2">sex and we may be needed thirty percent</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.400" end="00:52:28.549" style="s2">and we could have got the point across</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.449" end="00:52:30.859" style="s2">if there was a way to have that so</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.549" end="00:52:32.690" style="s2">people can realize maybe what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.859" end="00:52:36.829" style="s2">being told what we need isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.690" end="00:52:39.380" style="s2">what we need or even want and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.829" end="00:52:42.289" style="s2">one part one other thing I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.380" end="00:52:44.599" style="s2">remember I forgot already go I just want</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.289" end="00:52:45.890" style="s2">to throw that out there I think about I</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.599" end="00:52:47.509" style="s2">think you have a good point on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.890" end="00:52:49.400" style="s2">feedback loops I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.509" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">things we&#39;re learning with YouTube we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.400" end="00:52:54.109" style="s2">got lis these big corporate machines</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:55.759" style="s2">that are so afraid to take risks that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.109" end="00:52:57.619" style="s2">they just like well this worked let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.759" end="00:52:59.959" style="s2">keep doing that like what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.619" end="00:53:02.329" style="s2">with YouTube especially with news media</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.959" end="00:53:05.209" style="s2">is like they&#39;re freaking out they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.329" end="00:53:07.670" style="s2">like oh wait a second so they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.209" end="00:53:09.979" style="s2">well the people can only handle 30</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.670" end="00:53:11.989" style="s2">second sound bites two minute interviews</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.979" end="00:53:13.519" style="s2">and like that so it works and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.989" end="00:53:16.489" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t realize that people</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.519" end="00:53:19.910" style="s2">could actually handle 20 minute videos</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.489" end="00:53:23.509" style="s2">and that they would like that and so the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.910" end="00:53:25.309" style="s2">experimentation I think however you put</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.509" end="00:53:27.529" style="s2">it was like that&#39;s really cool they</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.309" end="00:53:29.209" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what actually how we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.529" end="00:53:33.289" style="s2">changed because they can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.209" end="00:53:36.440" style="s2">experiment I just remember the last</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.289" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">thing I was going to say um Jubilee if</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.440" end="00:53:41.809" style="s2">like if we are making our own media in</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:43.339" style="s2">our neighborhoods or whatnot and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.809" end="00:53:46.069" style="s2">voting let&#39;s say on it or we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.339" end="00:53:47.660" style="s2">saying we love it it affected me and</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.069" end="00:53:49.880" style="s2">then we just like to make it into a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.660" end="00:53:53.319" style="s2">bigger production our communities can</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.880" end="00:53:58.190" style="s2">support it and we could find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.319" end="00:54:00.140" style="s2">hurt to get people to engage in like</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.190" end="00:54:01.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say we have a lot of local things</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.140" end="00:54:03.739" style="s2">that we show in our movies so we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.880" end="00:54:05.239" style="s2">supporting our local businesses just by</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.739" end="00:54:07.130" style="s2">showing them in our movies and we kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.239" end="00:54:10.459" style="s2">of are tracking that with our currency</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.130" end="00:54:12.410" style="s2">system so we can see the value you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.459" end="00:54:15.529" style="s2">bring to your own community through that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.410" end="00:54:17.930" style="s2">and then in the bigger picture any</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.529" end="00:54:20.200" style="s2">profits can go back to the community and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.930" end="00:54:23.380" style="s2">maybe at the Commons love</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.200" end="00:54:34.420" style="s2">so it can like filter back out to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.380" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">community so okay it&#39;s a thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.420" end="00:54:40.900" style="s2">just like a tool to know what to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:43.060" style="s2">binge-watch next I think when you&#39;re out</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:33.010" style="s2">loosely on the Murdoch family so it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.820" end="00:56:48.730" style="s2">around seems to me there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:50.650" style="s2">and more and more crap you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.730" end="00:56:53.290" style="s2">mean just churned out by Netflix from</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.650" end="00:56:54.700" style="s2">prime and the real quality HBO type</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.290" end="00:56:56.770" style="s2">stuff that used to come out pretty</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.700" end="00:56:58.240" style="s2">regularly seems to dwindle I mean there</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.550" end="00:57:09.940" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to find the good stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.750" end="00:57:11.590" style="s2">amongst all the now so I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.940" end="00:57:13.720" style="s2">there&#39;s so much of it that&#39;s the issue</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.590" end="00:57:16.690" style="s2">like there&#39;s no way you can have water</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.720" end="00:57:18.490" style="s2">like everyone watches the same five</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.170" end="00:57:39.790" style="s2">say the thing they think would be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.210" end="00:57:41.530" style="s2">most powerful for 10,000 people and</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.940" end="00:57:46.750" style="s2">what do you think would be the most</p>

<p begin="00:58:27.250" end="00:58:31.600" style="s2">up and down and sideways really</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.260" end="00:58:33.580" style="s2">excellent solution does its own solves</p>

<p begin="00:58:33.580" end="00:58:39.400" style="s2">a whole bunch of of knock-on benefits</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.060" end="00:58:47.380" style="s2">that seems to me to be the my top choice</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.400" end="00:58:49.990" style="s2">are you sure I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.380" end="00:58:52.779" style="s2">do where I initially started I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.990" end="00:58:56.349" style="s2">this conversation wasn&#39;t about social</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.779" end="00:58:59.859" style="s2">media I think sources is way bigger</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.349" end="00:59:05.829" style="s2">problem than meets other things like by</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.859" end="00:59:07.390" style="s2">far but on this topic I guess I I guess</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.829" end="00:59:09.670" style="s2">I could see yeah like a well funded</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.390" end="00:59:12.779" style="s2">documentary clock making a really big</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.670" end="00:59:15.099" style="s2">impact there are people making amazing</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.779" end="00:59:17.619" style="s2">documentaries giving them a better</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.099" end="00:59:21.670" style="s2">platform to show those ones that already</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.619" end="00:59:23.410" style="s2">exist making it fun um making it you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.670" end="00:59:26.440" style="s2">know you have refreshments it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.410" end="00:59:35.109" style="s2">theatre that a conscious theatre what</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.440" end="00:59:36.339" style="s2">about that like everything you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.109" end="00:59:37.000" style="s2">saying I couldn&#39;t really hear you</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.339" end="00:59:40.180" style="s2">Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.000" end="00:59:42.910" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna just add I love what you guys</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.180" end="00:59:45.490" style="s2">are all talking about thank you</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.910" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">my most impactful one I think just</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.490" end="00:59:49.180" style="s2">because I&#39;m not a filmmaker so I would</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:50.980" style="s2">have less impact than the library thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.180" end="00:59:54.069" style="s2">although I think worldwide that would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.980" end="00:59:55.690" style="s2">most impactful and great for media in</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.069" end="01:00:00.670" style="s2">general for me I would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.690" end="01:00:02.890" style="s2">access to what diversity exists in roles</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.670" end="01:00:06.279" style="s2">and just the data behind that how many</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.890" end="01:00:07.900" style="s2">how many words are spoken how many</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.279" end="01:00:09.730" style="s2">because we can do a lot with that data</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.900" end="01:00:11.259" style="s2">it&#39;s just data and then we can say hey</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.730" end="01:00:13.660" style="s2">are we getting better are we getting</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.259" end="01:00:18.039" style="s2">more diversity how do I find roles that</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.660" end="01:00:20.309" style="s2">not to play but to watch so that would</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.039" end="01:00:23.529" style="s2">be my most or or something that sensors</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.309" end="01:00:25.839" style="s2">for more for my child so that I can say</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.529" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">hey I don&#39;t want these scenes to be in</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.839" end="01:00:29.559" style="s2">here I want to try watching this and see</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:30.970" style="s2">if it&#39;s okay for her but not with these</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.559" end="01:00:32.799" style="s2">scenes it&#39;s something like Lord of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.970" end="01:00:34.809" style="s2">Rings or something so that would be the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.799" end="01:00:36.730" style="s2">most impactful so this is like I said</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.809" end="01:00:38.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a two-parter although once I go</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.730" end="01:00:39.700" style="s2">punch in social media I was like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.380" end="01:00:42.250" style="s2">weird that that was and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.700" end="01:00:44.559" style="s2">three-parter with social media being one</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.250" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">of them I think it&#39;s because yeah social</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.559" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">media permeates all of them that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:50.500" style="s2">like we need a whole new platform and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:52.750" style="s2">that is partly what we are doing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.500" end="01:00:54.430" style="s2">second part is on Saturday on the</p>
