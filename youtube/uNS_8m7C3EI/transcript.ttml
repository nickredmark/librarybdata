<p begin="00:00:12.210" end="00:00:16.020" style="s2">really nice to be in this space and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.519" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">must have spent at least a hundred if</p>

<p begin="00:04:23.289" end="00:04:27.850" style="s2">all the things I&#39;m going to be talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:29.770" style="s2">about this evening we are facing three</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.850" end="00:04:32.440" style="s2">decades of collapse</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">but that collapses the collapse of an</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.759" end="00:04:50.940" style="s2">so even if we get everything right we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.850" end="00:04:57.310" style="s2">still face three decades of quite severe</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.940" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">upheaval we need to go upstream and look</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.310" end="00:05:03.820" style="s2">at this crisis of perception we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:06.750" style="s2">start thinking about how do we tell the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.820" end="00:05:11.050" style="s2">story of who we are why we are here and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.750" end="00:05:15.729" style="s2">what we could do if we actually lived in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.050" end="00:05:18.190" style="s2">a way that is creating conditions</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.539" end="00:05:34.990" style="s2">would also say that life in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:39.190" style="s2">is a regenerative community we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.990" end="00:05:40.930" style="s2">rejoin that community and to do that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.190" end="00:05:41.949" style="s2">need to change the stories we tell about</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.930" end="00:05:45.159" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.949" end="00:05:48.099" style="s2">and we need to change the organizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.159" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">ideas that shape our perception and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.099" end="00:05:54.940" style="s2">do I mean by that have a look at that</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.120" end="00:06:28.930" style="s2">organizing ideas are incredibly powerful</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.260" end="00:07:42.460" style="s2">unconscious unconscionable we have to do</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.460" end="00:07:46.990" style="s2">so maybe it&#39;s good to be here at Finland</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.830" end="00:07:48.190" style="s2">where one of the tag lines has often</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.990" end="00:07:51.460" style="s2">expected a miracle</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.190" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">we need one whoops</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.460" end="00:07:57.910" style="s2">another bit friend of the community</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:08:02.200" style="s2">Robert Gilman sketches it out in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.910" end="00:08:05.230" style="s2">way he talks about the era the tribal</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.200" end="00:08:07.510" style="s2">era that humanity went through and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.230" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">with the onset of Agriculture which to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.510" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">some extent was also the onset of us</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:17.050" style="s2">beginning to exploit the planet in a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:20.490" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t very wise we became able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.050" end="00:08:22.870" style="s2">settle and the era of empire started</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.490" end="00:08:25.600" style="s2">started to build cities were started to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.870" end="00:08:28.630" style="s2">create nations and empires that went to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.600" end="00:08:30.460" style="s2">war against each other so we began a war</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.630" end="00:08:34.930" style="s2">against nature and then we got began a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.460" end="00:08:37.570" style="s2">war against ourselves and then he Robert</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.930" end="00:08:39.460" style="s2">speaks about this moving into what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.570" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">called the planetary era and what I like</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.460" end="00:08:44.779" style="s2">about this graph is that in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:49.160" style="s2">the the Renaissance seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.779" end="00:08:51.740" style="s2">that with the Scientific Revolution a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.160" end="00:08:55.160" style="s2">new type of technology was made possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.740" end="00:08:58.220" style="s2">that then made it possible to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.160" end="00:09:00.800" style="s2">the planet much faster but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.220" end="00:09:02.839" style="s2">time through science the same science</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:04.999" style="s2">that gave us destructive technologies</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.839" end="00:09:09.079" style="s2">also gave us an understanding of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.999" end="00:09:11.720" style="s2">part of this living planet and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.079" end="00:09:16.939" style="s2">transition out of the era of empire into</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.720" end="00:09:20.870" style="s2">the planetary era to us with our 70 80</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.939" end="00:09:24.499" style="s2">85 90 year life spans seems very sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.870" end="00:09:28.029" style="s2">very long but really it&#39;s short for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.499" end="00:09:30.949" style="s2">complete transformation of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.029" end="00:09:33.529" style="s2">civilizational presence on earth and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.949" end="00:09:36.259" style="s2">that sometimes gives me hope that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.529" end="00:09:38.779" style="s2">now at the end of this large transition</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.259" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">area and that we just need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.779" end="00:09:45.290" style="s2">that what seems like nothing is moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:47.329" style="s2">is actually part of a larger process so</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.290" end="00:09:50.180" style="s2">we are moving into the planetary era</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.329" end="00:09:52.939" style="s2">this is me in 2006 just before I moved</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.180" end="00:09:54.980" style="s2">to find&#39; Han then the two big books in</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.939" end="00:09:57.829" style="s2">my hand are volume 1 and volume 2 of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.980" end="00:09:59.569" style="s2">that PhD I mentioned earlier designed</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.829" end="00:10:01.430" style="s2">for human and Planetary health a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.569" end="00:10:03.110" style="s2">holistic integral approach the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.430" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">complexity and sustainability sounds</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.110" end="00:10:09.350" style="s2">very academic what&#39;s amazing about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:11.149" style="s2">is that that when I came to Finland I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.350" end="00:10:13.910" style="s2">like when I finished the PhD I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.149" end="00:10:15.769" style="s2">find any way to do postdoctoral research</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.910" end="00:10:18.189" style="s2">because nobody wanted to fund me because</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.769" end="00:10:20.629" style="s2">it was too transdisciplinary and it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.189" end="00:10:22.759" style="s2">sent from one funding council to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.629" end="00:10:25.309" style="s2">other and so I kind of put it in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.759" end="00:10:27.800" style="s2">drawer came to find&#39; Han where so some</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.309" end="00:10:29.509" style="s2">extent I was in those days even it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.800" end="00:10:31.069" style="s2">good to hide your PhD because there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.509" end="00:10:32.779" style="s2">a bit of an attitude that if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.069" end="00:10:33.949" style="s2">PhD you were in your head and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.779" end="00:10:36.529" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t be in your heart and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.949" end="00:10:40.309" style="s2">probably weren&#39;t spiritual and and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.529" end="00:10:44.899" style="s2">took a while to here&#39;s a man who&#39;s lived</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.309" end="00:10:45.529" style="s2">this for 50 years so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.899" end="00:10:48.230" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.529" end="00:10:51.240" style="s2">but yeah just recently this summer I had</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.230" end="00:10:54.330" style="s2">a phone call from a man who said</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:56.279" style="s2">name&#39;s Anthony Capone I&#39;m a professor at</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.330" end="00:10:59.100" style="s2">the University of Sydney I&#39;m in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.279" end="00:11:01.050" style="s2">for a number of weeks because of two</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.100" end="00:11:03.060" style="s2">conferences and in between those two</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.050" end="00:11:06.620" style="s2">conferences I would really love to come</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.060" end="00:11:09.630" style="s2">and see you and I said okay and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.620" end="00:11:13.230" style="s2">interesting yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s meet and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.630" end="00:11:16.110" style="s2">he came to Majorca and he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.230" end="00:11:18.990" style="s2">co-author of a report that came out in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.110" end="00:11:21.870" style="s2">2017 by the Rockefeller Foundation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:25.800" style="s2">The Lancet the top medical journal that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.870" end="00:11:28.170" style="s2">is called planetary health and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.800" end="00:11:30.209" style="s2">whole mean that I wasn&#39;t actually aware</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.170" end="00:11:33.240" style="s2">of because I stopped following it has</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.209" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">grown enormously in the last three four</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.240" end="00:11:40.350" style="s2">or five years and there&#39;s a whole field</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:43.260" style="s2">of medicine now that understands that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.350" end="00:11:44.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep link between eco systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.260" end="00:11:47.459" style="s2">health and planetary health health</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.940" end="00:11:51.480" style="s2">actually is and this comes from my PhD</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.459" end="00:11:53.700" style="s2">is a emergent property of complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.480" end="00:11:56.310" style="s2">dynamic systems at different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.700" end="00:11:58.290" style="s2">scale so a healthy cell fits in a</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.130" end="00:12:09.630" style="s2">course it goes the other way around if</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.600" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">we do anything that is unhealthy at any</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.630" end="00:12:17.370" style="s2">of those levels it effects all other</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:20.730" style="s2">levels I came to call planetary health</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.370" end="00:12:23.940" style="s2">or I kept working in this field but a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.730" end="00:12:25.890" style="s2">couple of years ago I published a book</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.940" end="00:12:29.310" style="s2">called designing regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.890" end="00:12:31.800" style="s2">because this idea of regeneration is</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.310" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">also about health the idea of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.800" end="00:12:38.370" style="s2">is also about health and in this this</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:44.339" style="s2">book that the title of this book also</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.370" end="00:12:49.290" style="s2">kind of harbors a somewhat paradox which</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.339" end="00:12:51.390" style="s2">is that I on the one hand we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.290" end="00:12:54.360" style="s2">redesign the human plasma presence on</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.390" end="00:12:56.520" style="s2">earth and on the other hand cultures</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.360" end="00:12:59.790" style="s2">aren&#39;t designed cultures emerge through</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.520" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">the interactions that we have with each</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.790" end="00:13:04.690" style="s2">other the stories we tell so in that</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.690" end="00:13:10.150" style="s2">paradox I&#39;ve learned from one of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.390" end="00:13:12.550" style="s2">mentors at Omaha College that he said if</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.150" end="00:13:15.160" style="s2">you step on a paradox you can be sure to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.550" end="00:13:17.350" style="s2">have some truth on your shoes life is</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.160" end="00:13:19.840" style="s2">much more complicated than linear</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.350" end="00:13:22.600" style="s2">either-or thinking so when we work with</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.840" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">paradoxes we get closer to what truth is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.600" end="00:13:27.100" style="s2">actually about and the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:29.470" style="s2">in writing the book I realized very</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.100" end="00:13:31.450" style="s2">early on I thought what can I write in</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.470" end="00:13:34.630" style="s2">this book that would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.450" end="00:13:37.810" style="s2">meaningful in 10 years 15 years 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.630" end="00:13:40.090" style="s2">time and at some point I realized most</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.810" end="00:13:42.730" style="s2">of the solutions that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.090" end="00:13:43.510" style="s2">created for themselves and for future</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.730" end="00:13:46.060" style="s2">generations</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.510" end="00:13:50.050" style="s2">and were created with the best of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:52.150" style="s2">intentions and nevertheless so many of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.050" end="00:13:54.250" style="s2">them have turned into today&#39;s problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.150" end="00:13:56.260" style="s2">so yesterday&#39;s solutions turn into</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.250" end="00:13:59.500" style="s2">today&#39;s problems who are we to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.260" end="00:14:00.670" style="s2">that our sustainable regenerative green</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.500" end="00:14:03.160" style="s2">or whatever you want to call them</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.670" end="00:14:06.100" style="s2">solutions will not turn into problems</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.160" end="00:14:12.220" style="s2">later on so maybe we&#39;ve got it wrong as</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.100" end="00:14:14.410" style="s2">a culture that questions and transient</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.220" end="00:14:18.970" style="s2">means to get to better answers and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.410" end="00:14:21.370" style="s2">better solutions but solutions and</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.370" end="00:14:27.310" style="s2">better questions then maybe a wise</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.550" end="00:14:29.350" style="s2">culture when you try to create a compass</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.350" end="00:14:35.770" style="s2">to the next would actually create a set</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.830" end="00:14:38.350" style="s2">of questions to give to the next</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.770" end="00:14:41.170" style="s2">generation how do we fit in who are we</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.390" end="00:14:49.420" style="s2">these questions need to find new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:51.550" style="s2">meaning my my mentor David all once</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.420" end="00:14:54.310" style="s2">floored me with the question of saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.550" end="00:14:56.950" style="s2">Dan you before we can find the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.310" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">questions like how and what we might</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.270" end="00:15:06.339" style="s2">have to ask ourselves a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.980" end="00:15:09.330" style="s2">question and that question is what is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.339" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">about humanity that is worth sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.330" end="00:15:15.220" style="s2">and if we find an answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:18.750" style="s2">question then we might live our way into</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.220" end="00:15:18.750" style="s2">the future in a wiser way</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.380" end="00:15:25.370" style="s2">very briefly what do I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.700" end="00:15:27.830" style="s2">regenerative this spectrum is from a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.370" end="00:15:30.380" style="s2">friend of mine called Bill Reid who</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.830" end="00:15:32.660" style="s2">works with a group called the Regenesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.380" end="00:15:35.180" style="s2">group it&#39;s also been influenced by a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.660" end="00:15:37.880" style="s2">woman called Carol Sanford and basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.180" end="00:15:40.430" style="s2">it tells this it creates a spectrum from</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.880" end="00:15:42.410" style="s2">business-as-usual to green which way</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.430" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">means doing things a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.410" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">polluting a little less using a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.540" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">bit more renewable energy which is part</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:53.089" style="s2">of the journey and then we get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:55.730" style="s2">sustainable which means no negative</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.089" end="00:15:58.070" style="s2">impacts like not adding any more damage</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.730" end="00:16:00.620" style="s2">but because we&#39;ve done so much damage we</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.070" end="00:16:03.020" style="s2">need to do more than that so then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.620" end="00:16:07.160" style="s2">move into restorative which can still be</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.020" end="00:16:10.850" style="s2">in a mindset that is humanity as power</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.160" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">over nature and man and nature I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.850" end="00:16:16.700" style="s2">saying man on purpose because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">created most of the mess and so you end</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.700" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">up with situations where we try to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:22.670" style="s2">create large forest plantations in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.890" style="s2">wrong place of the wrong kind of species</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.670" end="00:16:25.579" style="s2">and then then they like eucalyptus in a</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.579" end="00:16:29.959" style="s2">area and they look very nice for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.500" end="00:16:34.040" style="s2">decade or two and then they die because</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.959" end="00:16:37.130" style="s2">we we engineered an ecosystem so once we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.040" end="00:16:39.230" style="s2">do the reconciliatory step shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.130" end="00:16:43.160" style="s2">organizing idea that we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.230" end="00:16:45.250" style="s2">nature that we can design as nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.160" end="00:16:48.140" style="s2">because we&#39;re nothing but it we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.250" end="00:16:53.060" style="s2">biological beings first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.140" end="00:16:57.589" style="s2">then we move into working regenerative</p>

<p begin="00:17:39.910" end="00:17:51.940" style="s2">happened and so we now face having to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:55.420" style="s2">from this to this and it is possible</p>
