<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>

<p begin="00:00:23.779" end="00:00:30.590" style="s2">exhausted but I feel nice</p>

<p begin="00:00:30.590" end="00:00:37.460" style="s2">Jared I was like seeing those guys so</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.460" end="00:00:42.050" style="s2">the stoah and so is a place for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.800" end="00:00:45.379" style="s2">cohere and dialogue but what matters</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.050" end="00:00:47.540" style="s2">most at the nice edge rates of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.379" end="00:00:51.830" style="s2">moment so if you co a sheep with a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.540" end="00:00:53.510" style="s2">motto we just chop things so for the new</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.830" end="00:00:55.640" style="s2">faces here what we&#39;re having we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.510" end="00:00:57.140" style="s2">having weekly sessions or maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.640" end="00:01:00.860" style="s2">having weekly sessions called the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.140" end="00:01:02.839" style="s2">mediation campfire and this concept that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.860" end="00:01:06.080" style="s2">this idea emerged from a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.839" end="00:01:09.560" style="s2">that Jared and Jason and myself did on</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:10.760" style="s2">the stove podcast about having sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.560" end="00:01:14.210" style="s2">around this digital campfire just</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.760" end="00:01:17.030" style="s2">spitballing how do what is mathematic</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.210" end="00:01:20.090" style="s2">mediation and how to make it happen in</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.030" end="00:01:21.950" style="s2">the noosphere so this is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.090" end="00:01:23.780" style="s2">high-level discussion just this like</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.950" end="00:01:26.540" style="s2">just FYI there&#39;s a lot of insider</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.780" end="00:01:29.060" style="s2">baseball stuff that may happen here but</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.540" end="00:01:31.010" style="s2">we thought this might be the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.060" end="00:01:32.900" style="s2">kind of evolve the discussion because</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.010" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">both Jason and myself just submitted</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.900" end="00:01:37.340" style="s2">articles on mimetic mediation to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:39.920" style="s2">side view so this is sort of a merging</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.340" end="00:01:41.380" style="s2">topic and immersion conversation but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.920" end="00:01:44.570" style="s2">three of us really believe that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.380" end="00:01:46.220" style="s2">needed and Jason and Jared they have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.570" end="00:01:48.350" style="s2">podcast called both end and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.220" end="00:01:51.050" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the official unofficial frame</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.350" end="00:01:53.120" style="s2">of being a memetic mediation podcast or</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.050" end="00:01:55.370" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the explicit themes so how</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.120" end="00:01:57.050" style="s2">today is gonna work is that three of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.370" end="00:01:59.060" style="s2">are just gonna jam for me with like 5-10</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.050" end="00:02:00.590" style="s2">minutes about from the mediation maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.060" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">stuff that we talked about last time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.590" end="00:02:04.190" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna open it up to the group</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have a group discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.190" end="00:02:09.379" style="s2">see where it flows so that being said to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:13.010" style="s2">adjacent you want to start off with</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.379" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">initial thoughts sure well I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.010" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">maybe we should introduce the concept a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:22.280" style="s2">little bit just because there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">of new faces here and so for those that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.280" end="00:02:25.999" style="s2">don&#39;t know that the concept actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">came I think he was coined by by Peter</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.999" end="00:02:28.550" style="s2">he&#39;s being humble but it was coined by</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:31.940" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.550" end="00:02:35.210" style="s2">and in a paper with Connor Barnes coach</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.940" end="00:02:38.390" style="s2">42.0 and basically the premise and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.210" end="00:02:42.310" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong Peter was that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:45.410" style="s2">we have we&#39;re witnessing kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.310" end="00:02:47.240" style="s2">fractionating set of what are called</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.410" end="00:02:50.930" style="s2">nomadic tribes or what he called mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.240" end="00:02:53.150" style="s2">tribes and due to the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.930" end="00:02:55.430" style="s2">internet and perhaps algorithms and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.150" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">things of that nature there&#39;s this kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.430" end="00:03:01.670" style="s2">of filter bubbles or reality tunnels</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:05.020" style="s2">better forming and you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.670" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">internally coherent give or take but</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.020" end="00:03:10.340" style="s2">they they tend to strawman outside</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:12.320" style="s2">groups and they tend to just think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.340" end="00:03:18.110" style="s2">they have the correct mu on reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.320" end="00:03:20.120" style="s2">right and and I guess coming at it from</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.110" end="00:03:22.250" style="s2">my point of view you know and why I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.120" end="00:03:25.000" style="s2">resonated with that term and and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:27.710" style="s2">started talking about it is that for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.000" end="00:03:30.190" style="s2">you know we with the rise of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.710" end="00:03:32.120" style="s2">internet there&#39;s a great opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.190" end="00:03:34.250" style="s2">you know have some kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.120" end="00:03:36.860" style="s2">sense making that might be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.250" end="00:03:40.330" style="s2">alternative to the current current</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.860" end="00:03:42.950" style="s2">institutions in society</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.330" end="00:03:44.780" style="s2">but in order for that to happen there</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:47.090" style="s2">needs to be some kind of robust</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.780" end="00:03:48.830" style="s2">information flow across all of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.090" end="00:03:51.290" style="s2">different communities so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.830" end="00:03:53.420" style="s2">coordinate not that they need to like</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.290" end="00:03:55.550" style="s2">each other necessarily but there needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.420" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">to be some kind of common language or</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.550" end="00:04:00.410" style="s2">you know some kind of common translation</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:03.380" style="s2">so at least you know we&#39;re not straw</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.410" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">Manning each other and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.380" end="00:04:07.580" style="s2">collaborating when possible and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:10.670" style="s2">that&#39;s basically how I understand the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.580" end="00:04:12.830" style="s2">premise and it&#39;s an open source concept</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.670" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t really been you know put down</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.830" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">into a set of formal heuristics or</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:19.520" style="s2">workshops but it&#39;s something that Jared</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:21.650" style="s2">and I&#39;ve you know we&#39;ve had this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.520" end="00:04:22.610" style="s2">for about a year and we try and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.650" end="00:04:25.220" style="s2">bring on people from many different</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.610" end="00:04:26.480" style="s2">perspectives on to the podcast and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.220" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">have a constructive conversation you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.480" end="00:04:31.190" style="s2">know so it&#39;s not nothing really new or</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:34.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s nothing that none of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.190" end="00:04:37.100" style="s2">are familiar with but it&#39;s I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.480" end="00:04:38.570" style="s2">particularly meant for the online space</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.100" end="00:04:41.210" style="s2">although it doesn&#39;t have to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.570" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">online space but it&#39;s it&#39;s just trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.210" end="00:04:46.009" style="s2">to have a better</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:50.020" style="s2">collective dialogue I&#39;ll leave it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.009" end="00:04:50.020" style="s2">or no Peter Jared want to add anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.030" end="00:04:59.380" style="s2">jump injured nothing nothing at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">moment still kind of in a very open</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.380" end="00:05:04.990" style="s2">space right now yeah I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:08.340" style="s2">good good description or a good good</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.990" end="00:05:11.770" style="s2">foundation to delay at least actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.340" end="00:05:14.050" style="s2">one thing I will say if you didn&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.770" end="00:05:17.980" style="s2">anybody didn&#39;t get a chance to watch</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.050" end="00:05:21.670" style="s2">this this conversation that we had last</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.980" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">week one of the common themes was around</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.670" end="00:05:26.230" style="s2">seeing or at least from our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">it seems like we see the thematic</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.230" end="00:05:31.750" style="s2">mediation as a longer term goal or</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">orientation as opposed to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.750" end="00:05:41.950" style="s2">like you know seeking you know some sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:43.900" style="s2">of consensus reality in in in single</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.950" end="00:05:45.400" style="s2">sittings or something like that so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.900" end="00:05:48.100" style="s2">I think this is this is more of like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.400" end="00:05:50.980" style="s2">process orientation rather than some</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.100" end="00:05:53.650" style="s2">sort of short-term outcome oriented</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.980" end="00:05:55.780" style="s2">project and I think that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.650" end="00:05:59.950" style="s2">shifts the frame a bit and allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.780" end="00:06:01.660" style="s2">be a little bit to occupy the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.950" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">space in between as opposed to you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.660" end="00:06:07.240" style="s2">go hearing some specific pneumatic mmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:09.910" style="s2">medic mediation tribe or something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.240" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">that so yeah just just to add a bit a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.910" end="00:06:14.230" style="s2">bit there so that we don&#39;t get on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:17.640" style="s2">rabbit hole again because I know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.230" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">been on it many times so it&#39;s a common</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.640" end="00:06:23.290" style="s2">common perspective yeah and so the last</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:25.720" style="s2">week there was that kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.290" end="00:06:27.640" style="s2">debate between should we have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.720" end="00:06:29.020" style="s2">superordinate goal that unites all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.640" end="00:06:31.210" style="s2">tribes together and we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.020" end="00:06:32.500" style="s2">people rallying around that or sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.210" end="00:06:34.900" style="s2">like you know Jason&#39;s metaphor just</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.500" end="00:06:36.640" style="s2">everyone grab a beer around the digital</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.900" end="00:06:38.410" style="s2">campfire feel the warmth together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.640" end="00:06:40.420" style="s2">feel each other&#39;s heart that&#39;s step one</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.410" end="00:06:43.390" style="s2">and then we can start talking you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.420" end="00:06:46.150" style="s2">business propositional business and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.390" end="00:06:47.890" style="s2">what&#39;s merging of those stoah so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.150" end="00:06:50.770" style="s2">happening in my mind with this this</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.890" end="00:06:52.270" style="s2">mimetic tribal term like asymmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.770" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">communication if you just start talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.270" end="00:06:56.590" style="s2">about propositions and strange</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:06:57.730" style="s2">attractors on asymmetrical communication</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.590" end="00:06:59.710" style="s2">platforms like Twitter or Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.730" end="00:07:00.730" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna create mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.710" end="00:07:03.310" style="s2">because there&#39;s like a disembodied</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.730" end="00:07:05.439" style="s2">component to it but what I like about</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.310" end="00:07:06.929" style="s2">this space of the stoah is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.439" end="00:07:09.969" style="s2">there&#39;s like an embodied energy</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.929" end="00:07:11.169" style="s2">happening like like existential dance</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.969" end="00:07:12.969" style="s2">party were dancing together we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.169" end="00:07:15.009" style="s2">feeling the same things yesterday a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.969" end="00:07:16.809" style="s2">Tyson who&#39;s in the room right now he did</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.009" end="00:07:18.429" style="s2">this freestyling through the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.809" end="00:07:19.809" style="s2">which is all this flow state I felt</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.429" end="00:07:21.879" style="s2">deeply connected ray is doing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.809" end="00:07:24.599" style="s2">snapping of fingers it just felt like</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.879" end="00:07:28.179" style="s2">the energy was there the love was there</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.599" end="00:07:30.129" style="s2">and so I think there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.179" end="00:07:31.959" style="s2">to make that transition between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.129" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">mimetic tribe to the embody tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.959" end="00:07:37.449" style="s2">there has to be a more emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:40.719" style="s2">community however that community gets</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.449" end="00:07:47.709" style="s2">formed over broadcasts over the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.719" end="00:07:50.499" style="s2">broadcast medium yeah I well I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.709" end="00:07:54.189" style="s2">agree more with this is one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.499" end="00:07:57.129" style="s2">recently wrote about is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.189" end="00:08:00.009" style="s2">and this is really just really basic and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.129" end="00:08:02.079" style="s2">old-school but I think you know before</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.009" end="00:08:03.519" style="s2">any of us you know if we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.079" end="00:08:05.709" style="s2">disagreements in terms of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.519" end="00:08:07.089" style="s2">worldview things like that I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.709" end="00:08:09.849" style="s2">so much easier to connect sub</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.089" end="00:08:11.919" style="s2">ideological you know and just as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.849" end="00:08:14.050" style="s2">know Peter said get a get a beer around</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.919" end="00:08:16.179" style="s2">the campfire or you know share it share</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.050" end="00:08:19.209" style="s2">a love for a similar you know musical</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.179" end="00:08:20.979" style="s2">form or some other aesthetic you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.209" end="00:08:23.050" style="s2">play sports you know all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.979" end="00:08:25.329" style="s2">are just kind of like old school but you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.050" end="00:08:28.059" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s really you know it feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.329" end="00:08:29.769" style="s2">like and that&#39;s what that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.059" end="00:08:32.919" style="s2">internet is so you know it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.769" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">difficult medium sometimes for you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.919" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">or why the Internet can promote discord</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.550" style="s2">is because we&#39;re not having these</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:43.000" style="s2">embodied relational experiences right</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.550" end="00:08:44.860" style="s2">and so I think what you&#39;re doing Peter</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.000" end="00:08:46.389" style="s2">with this dough and these more embody</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.860" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">things even though it&#39;s still you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.389" end="00:08:52.059" style="s2">remote over video is that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:53.529" style="s2">are developing more of these relational</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.059" end="00:08:55.899" style="s2">bonds and then when we do get to like</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.529" end="00:08:58.089" style="s2">okay like the way you see the world is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.899" end="00:08:58.899" style="s2">stupid and I&#39;m gonna tell you why like</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.089" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">when you start having that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.899" end="00:09:03.430" style="s2">or at least menteur maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:05.980" style="s2">less you know confrontational you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.430" end="00:09:08.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit more shared empathy</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.980" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2">and and relational trust built that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.319" end="00:09:16.029" style="s2">could actually you know have a more good</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.050" end="00:09:17.829" style="s2">good-faith conversation yeah and I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.029" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">also kind of add there to Peter I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.829" end="00:09:21.129" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:24.129" style="s2">this is embodied component I think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.129" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">reason it&#39;s so important kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.129" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">doubling down on this these the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:31.209" style="s2">things that kind of hold the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:35.559" style="s2">together are very cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.209" end="00:09:36.970" style="s2">intellectual and and you know they doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.559" end="00:09:38.559" style="s2">things like that you&#39;re a little state</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.970" end="00:09:39.970" style="s2">checks or whatever you do whenever you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.559" end="00:09:41.139" style="s2">open these sessions beater of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.970" end="00:09:44.170" style="s2">getting into your body and being aware</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.139" end="00:09:46.360" style="s2">of your emotional relevance and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.170" end="00:09:48.910" style="s2">displaying it to everybody kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.360" end="00:09:50.850" style="s2">vulnerable with that it was such a human</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.910" end="00:09:54.339" style="s2">thing that it&#39;s a great way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.850" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">immediately realize that you were in in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.339" end="00:10:01.199" style="s2">dialog with with other humans and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:10:04.529" style="s2">we&#39;re not here to you know just simply</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.199" end="00:10:06.519" style="s2">live in the Met mimetic Wars I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.529" end="00:10:08.470" style="s2">right and I think I mentioned this last</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.519" end="00:10:10.449" style="s2">time I did like that emotional check-ins</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.470" end="00:10:12.490" style="s2">with Jack Murphy and I mentioned I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.449" end="00:10:14.589" style="s2">nervous or whatever and then and invited</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.490" end="00:10:16.209" style="s2">him I think to mention he was nervous</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.589" end="00:10:19.540" style="s2">he&#39;s like you know uber alpha male</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.209" end="00:10:21.189" style="s2">mastery guy so I think yeah just being</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.540" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">in that presence like modeling that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.189" end="00:10:25.929" style="s2">think it&#39;s helpful this is the last</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:28.449" style="s2">thing I&#39;ll say and then maybe one more</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.929" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">round open up to the group but one thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.449" end="00:10:33.129" style="s2">I thought might be interesting is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:35.740" style="s2">actually explore ideas of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.129" end="00:10:38.069" style="s2">maybe seduce people into this digital</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.740" end="00:10:40.899" style="s2">campfire that have different ideological</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.069" end="00:10:42.579" style="s2">opinions just to get them to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.899" end="00:10:44.649" style="s2">each other in a way and I&#39;ll share an</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.579" end="00:10:46.949" style="s2">idea that Jordan Hall sent me via email</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.649" end="00:10:50.290" style="s2">the other day</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.949" end="00:10:52.899" style="s2">so basically created a weekly new show</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.290" end="00:10:55.029" style="s2">that provides local weather medical aid</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.899" end="00:10:56.350" style="s2">weather reports in a way from earnest</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.029" end="00:10:58.300" style="s2">members of different cultural tribes</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.350" end="00:11:00.189" style="s2">like Pat Ryan give some people a chance</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.300" end="00:11:04.689" style="s2">BJ can will get something from the gun</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.189" end="00:11:06.819" style="s2">culture somebody from SJW land and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.689" end="00:11:08.470" style="s2">think with my kind of ability to be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.819" end="00:11:10.389" style="s2">performative agnostic and then this kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.470" end="00:11:12.309" style="s2">of space being as open as it is I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.389" end="00:11:13.929" style="s2">this could be a good place for something</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.309" end="00:11:15.490" style="s2">like that so I thought that was a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.929" end="00:11:18.850" style="s2">cool idea and anyone wants to take the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.490" end="00:11:20.019" style="s2">lead on that let me know but I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:23.620" style="s2">there&#39;s other ideas that could emerge</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.019" end="00:11:27.580" style="s2">with that spirit so I&#39;m curious with you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.620" end="00:11:29.980" style="s2">and Jason and Jared think about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.580" end="00:11:31.930" style="s2">I like the idea and I might actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.980" end="00:11:35.350" style="s2">really like to open it up to others soon</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.930" end="00:11:38.050" style="s2">to see what everyone else thinks I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.350" end="00:11:40.140" style="s2">we need you know volunteers to you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.050" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">like we would need like you said seduce</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.140" end="00:11:45.430" style="s2">like the people reporting on okay this</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:47.800" style="s2">is this this kind of loosely knit</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.430" end="00:11:49.720" style="s2">subgroup of people that you know have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.800" end="00:11:53.770" style="s2">you know somewhat of a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.720" end="00:11:55.870" style="s2">worldview at least implied they would</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.770" end="00:11:57.250" style="s2">have to kind of be a trusted member in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.870" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">that group right because you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.250" end="00:12:01.450" style="s2">start having Outsiders come in and give</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">reports you know and if it&#39;s slanted it</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.450" end="00:12:08.080" style="s2">might you know turn I don&#39;t know like it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.610" end="00:12:10.750" style="s2">just it just might not go over well</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.080" end="00:12:12.040" style="s2">right if members of that group that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.750" end="00:12:13.630" style="s2">being reported on be like who is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.040" end="00:12:17.170" style="s2">guy like we don&#39;t know this guy like he</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.630" end="00:12:19.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know anything like his bias is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.170" end="00:12:21.250" style="s2">honestly of no way you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.510" end="00:12:23.890" style="s2">there&#39;s just that but I&#39;m really curious</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.250" end="00:12:25.300" style="s2">to open it up to others and see see what</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.890" end="00:12:29.380" style="s2">others think at this point go from there</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.300" end="00:12:30.700" style="s2">cool cool so if you know I trust the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.380" end="00:12:32.110" style="s2">discernment of everyone in the group so</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.700" end="00:12:34.810" style="s2">if anyone feels like they want to come</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.110" end="00:12:36.250" style="s2">off mute and just chat about anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.810" end="00:12:45.070" style="s2">that&#39;s been said we&#39;ll just your popcorn</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.250" end="00:12:46.540" style="s2">style and see what emerges who is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.070" end="00:12:54.790" style="s2">first piece of corn that wants to pop</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.540" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">them one is like it sounds like instead</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.790" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">of coming up with like a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:01.660" style="s2">central goal of what you&#39;re working on I</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.140" end="00:13:04.840" style="s2">mean they&#39;re at least part of it is like</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.660" end="00:13:06.430" style="s2">how do you sit with multiple reality you</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.840" end="00:13:07.900" style="s2">know like holding space for multiple</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.430" end="00:13:11.320" style="s2">realities at the same time so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.900" end="00:13:12.760" style="s2">the cultivation of that skill which I</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.320" end="00:13:15.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether it be a goal in and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.760" end="00:13:17.830" style="s2">of itself but that&#39;s one piece and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.640" end="00:13:21.490" style="s2">the other thing that came up is I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.830" end="00:13:25.390" style="s2">just noticed a contraction in my system</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.490" end="00:13:27.400" style="s2">we use the word seduce that and I come</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.390" end="00:13:28.840" style="s2">from I spent a lot of time in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.400" end="00:13:30.460" style="s2">12-step world and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.840" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">we have is this concept of Attraction</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.460" end="00:13:33.820" style="s2">rather than promotion how do you attract</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:36.490" style="s2">how do you make what you&#39;re doing more</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.820" end="00:13:38.350" style="s2">attractive that instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.490" end="00:13:39.910" style="s2">promote it or yeah there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.350" end="00:13:41.350" style="s2">about that that word seduce that I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.910" end="00:13:44.050" style="s2">like I don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.350" end="00:13:46.510" style="s2">a fan of that that that but but I do</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.050" end="00:13:48.190" style="s2">understand the concept from you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.510" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like you don&#39;t want to promote it</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.190" end="00:13:53.500" style="s2">but at the same time how do i how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:14:02.230" style="s2">get more people to participate in I do</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.500" end="00:14:08.530" style="s2">like the idea of a weather report all</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.230" end="00:14:10.260" style="s2">pop so cure one phrase you mentioned was</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.530" end="00:14:16.120" style="s2">like being able to hold multiple</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.260" end="00:14:19.210" style="s2">perspectives or ideas and I&#39;ve to meet</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.120" end="00:14:22.840" style="s2">there are two creators that have good</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.210" end="00:14:24.340" style="s2">examples of like having they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.840" end="00:14:27.160" style="s2">create or have different discussions</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.340" end="00:14:31.210" style="s2">like with themselves as different people</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.160" end="00:14:32.650" style="s2">so contra points if you all know her she</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.210" end="00:14:34.540" style="s2">has a couple of videos where she has</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.650" end="00:14:37.510" style="s2">like three or four different</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.540" end="00:14:39.850" style="s2">personalities there&#39;s like cat girl left</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.510" end="00:14:43.450" style="s2">and I&#39;m like neo like centrist left girl</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.850" end="00:14:47.980" style="s2">like debating or something and then Jay</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.450" end="00:14:49.450" style="s2">reg also his is a bit kind of character</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.980" end="00:14:51.220" style="s2">like but it&#39;s kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.450" end="00:14:54.190" style="s2">entertaining he where he has all these</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.220" end="00:14:57.700" style="s2">different he uses the like the political</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.190" end="00:14:59.740" style="s2">the to a political spectrum and that has</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.700" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">characters that sort of exists in each</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.740" end="00:15:05.850" style="s2">part of the spectrum so at least from an</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:19.870" style="s2">entertainment perspective those could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.850" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">two sources of ideas or inspiration yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.870" end="00:15:23.230" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s coming up on that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:26.890" style="s2">the it seems to be two different</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.230" end="00:15:29.080" style="s2">orientations and one of them both of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.890" end="00:15:31.630" style="s2">them I think are super valuable I know</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.080" end="00:15:33.550" style="s2">Peter likes the phrase performative</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.630" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">agnostic which seems to be kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.550" end="00:15:37.660" style="s2">throwing yourself in embodying a certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:39.870" style="s2">perspective and feeling what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.660" end="00:15:44.980" style="s2">like to be coming from that orientation</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.870" end="00:15:48.340" style="s2">which is very kind of like I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.980" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">primarily embodied a technique and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.340" end="00:15:54.630" style="s2">the other one would be kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:56.620" style="s2">occupy the space that surrounds</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.630" end="00:15:59.250" style="s2">each of the each of the different</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.620" end="00:15:59.250" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.280" end="00:16:05.160" style="s2">I think the especially the performative</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.340" end="00:16:10.210" style="s2">agnostic the kind of embodied</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.160" end="00:16:12.130" style="s2">orientation seems to be a very direct</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.210" end="00:16:14.260" style="s2">route to kind of pulling out you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.130" end="00:16:16.390" style="s2">pulling on certain triggers and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.260" end="00:16:18.970" style="s2">themes that you you might be might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.390" end="00:16:21.880" style="s2">less or more sensitive in so it feels</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.970" end="00:16:25.090" style="s2">like a little bit more direct route but</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.880" end="00:16:27.010" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know I me personally I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.090" end="00:16:30.060" style="s2">think I usually end up being a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.010" end="00:16:34.030" style="s2">bit more in the empty space around</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.060" end="00:16:35.800" style="s2">around things but possibly because I</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.030" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">spend a lot of time kind of in my own</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.800" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">ideological tribes and deeply embodied</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:43.390" style="s2">for quite some years and took a while to</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:47.020" style="s2">crawl myself out so yeah just some some</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.390" end="00:16:50.020" style="s2">random thoughts to throw in there I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.020" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">really I think I&#39;m really curious if if</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.020" end="00:16:58.960" style="s2">anybody wants to share in their own you</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:17:02.350" style="s2">know life or mimetic space if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.960" end="00:17:04.089" style="s2">you know if there&#39;s certain kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.350" end="00:17:05.410" style="s2">know worldviews that are that are kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.089" end="00:17:06.910" style="s2">of in tension with each other even</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.410" end="00:17:08.860" style="s2">within yourself right because once that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.910" end="00:17:11.709" style="s2">one thing that I don&#39;t know the way I</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.860" end="00:17:14.350" style="s2">think of it often times is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.709" end="00:17:15.699" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to mediate tribes in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.350" end="00:17:17.440" style="s2">outside world because there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.699" end="00:17:19.180" style="s2">there&#39;s warring tribes within us right</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.440" end="00:17:22.510" style="s2">and there&#39;s warring ideas within us and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.180" end="00:17:24.130" style="s2">memes and worldviews that create some</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.510" end="00:17:25.900" style="s2">kind of cognitive dissonance and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.130" end="00:17:28.870" style="s2">curious if anybody would like to share</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.900" end="00:17:31.780" style="s2">you know within your own you know in</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.870" end="00:17:35.410" style="s2">your own sphere what some of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.780" end="00:17:37.450" style="s2">dissonant you know mental models are</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.410" end="00:17:39.550" style="s2">either that you observe but you&#39;reyou&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.450" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">kind of participated in or it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.550" end="00:17:46.540" style="s2">barely really internal yeah anybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">would like to share that I&#39;ll share and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.540" end="00:17:54.730" style="s2">sorry I think I&#39;m just a number and no</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:57.960" style="s2">face I don&#39;t know how to change I won</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.730" end="00:18:01.570" style="s2">one that I&#39;ve observed recently is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.960" end="00:18:05.610" style="s2">cognitive dissonance between</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.570" end="00:18:08.440" style="s2">I guess kind of like wanting to be pro</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.610" end="00:18:11.290" style="s2">like in on the progressive side of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.440" end="00:18:13.450" style="s2">things wanting to be pro restorative</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.290" end="00:18:16.690" style="s2">justice or pro like anti mass</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.450" end="00:18:18.370" style="s2">incarceration and I&#39;m Pro forgiveness or</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.690" end="00:18:19.780" style="s2">pro not judging people by the worst</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.370" end="00:18:20.530" style="s2">thing they ever did but then on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.780" end="00:18:23.610" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.530" end="00:18:26.650" style="s2">not wanting to lend that to people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.610" end="00:18:28.740" style="s2">commit sexual abuse of power it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.650" end="00:18:31.690" style="s2">how on the one hand can I be pro</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.740" end="00:18:34.690" style="s2">forgiveness while being pro zero</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.690" end="00:18:37.690" style="s2">tolerance for perpetrators of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.690" end="00:18:39.490" style="s2">abuse it&#39;s something I&#39;ve kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.690" end="00:18:42.010" style="s2">up against a little bit in my work is</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.490" end="00:18:45.160" style="s2">that cognitive dissonance but that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.010" end="00:18:47.020" style="s2">something I&#39;ve I&#39;ve witnessed and then I</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.160" end="00:18:48.670" style="s2">just wanted to throw in a response to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.020" end="00:18:51.460" style="s2">the previous question of what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.670" end="00:18:55.480" style="s2">our kind of the previous topic of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.460" end="00:19:00.130" style="s2">kind of tactics might might help</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.480" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">facilitate mimetic mediation I have I</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.130" end="00:19:05.350" style="s2">have this little I guess I it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:07.530" style="s2">practice that I developed and I also</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.350" end="00:19:11.710" style="s2">just have to say as someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.530" end="00:19:13.570" style="s2">attempted to facilitate conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.710" end="00:19:16.540" style="s2">interaction between different worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.570" end="00:19:18.820" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to get like certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.540" end="00:19:22.780" style="s2">worldviews are in and of themselves not</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.820" end="00:19:25.660" style="s2">particularly interested in interacting</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.780" end="00:19:28.750" style="s2">with other worldviews like that is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.660" end="00:19:32.980" style="s2">is of interest to some mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.750" end="00:19:37.090" style="s2">and not others right liberal literally</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.980" end="00:19:39.040" style="s2">means open and that is a value that some</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.090" end="00:19:40.300" style="s2">mimetic tribes have I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.040" end="00:19:44.560" style="s2">mean I think that could be an</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.300" end="00:19:47.230" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m like meta column in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.560" end="00:19:49.450" style="s2">you know mimetic tribe spreadsheet is</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.230" end="00:19:51.990" style="s2">like how interested are you or open are</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.450" end="00:19:54.790" style="s2">you to even kind of engaging with and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.990" end="00:19:56.290" style="s2">acknowledging the other tribes are even</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.790" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">acknowledging that you&#39;re like one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.290" end="00:20:01.450" style="s2">many tribes but anyway the technique is</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:03.400" style="s2">um I call it where I&#39;m coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.450" end="00:20:05.080" style="s2">what I have done and I&#39;ll just give a</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.400" end="00:20:07.480" style="s2">specific example so I did this at</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.080" end="00:20:10.270" style="s2">Facebook with them Facebook employees</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.480" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">and then like non non Facebook employees</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.270" end="00:20:17.020" style="s2">who were there for a an event but</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:19.780" style="s2">and I have people do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.020" end="00:20:23.230" style="s2">guided writing about in this case it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.780" end="00:20:25.299" style="s2">like it&#39;s just how hot like how we feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.230" end="00:20:27.309" style="s2">about Facebook our hopes and fears about</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.299" end="00:20:29.470" style="s2">Facebook and then people put all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.309" end="00:20:31.150" style="s2">their writings in a pile at the front of</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.470" end="00:20:34.330" style="s2">the room and then people come up one by</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.150" end="00:20:36.070" style="s2">one pull out up pull out a testimonial</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.330" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">and read it out loud</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.070" end="00:20:43.110" style="s2">in first person as if it was their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s just a very simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.110" end="00:20:48.370" style="s2">inhabiting where someone else is coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:49.990" style="s2">from and and off it&#39;s kind of disarming</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.370" end="00:20:51.580" style="s2">because often it&#39;s really obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.990" end="00:20:53.289" style="s2">someone is reading something that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.580" end="00:20:55.539" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with but there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.289" end="00:20:58.570" style="s2">nothing else to do other than just kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.539" end="00:21:02.230" style="s2">of like speak another person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.570" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">perspective in first person and just get</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.230" end="00:21:06.309" style="s2">inside of it and see where that takes</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:08.950" style="s2">you and it actually it kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.309" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">brought some humor into the space which</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.950" end="00:21:12.940" style="s2">was really helpful for them getting down</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">and dirty and having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.940" end="00:21:17.980" style="s2">between Facebook employees and like I</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:19.900" style="s2">don&#39;t need to go into the specifics of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.980" end="00:21:22.570" style="s2">what the event was that it just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.900" end="00:21:24.130" style="s2">injected some honesty and humor into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.570" end="00:21:26.409" style="s2">room so that we could actually just kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.130" end="00:21:28.740" style="s2">of like have a real I guess you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.409" end="00:21:35.740" style="s2">say kind of somewhat mimetic mediated</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.740" end="00:21:37.419" style="s2">conversation included a list of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.740" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">conversational modalities every street</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.419" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">partland</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:41.380" style="s2">I and John rebecky kind of are</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:42.760" style="s2">collecting so if you have any one you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.380" end="00:21:45.370" style="s2">add there and some of these I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.760" end="00:21:51.880" style="s2">could be used for you know various</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.370" end="00:21:55.330" style="s2">emetic mediation exercises maybe I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.880" end="00:21:57.010" style="s2">on that last note that was just</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.330" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">mentioned that there&#39;s medic tried I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.010" end="00:22:01.390" style="s2">don&#39;t even want up and each other ones</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.460" style="s2">so I think that that&#39;s one I belong to</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.390" end="00:22:07.030" style="s2">generally where there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.460" end="00:22:09.340" style="s2">interest and even like really perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.030" end="00:22:11.650" style="s2">an external world use in an active</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.340" end="00:22:14.070" style="s2">fashion and then things trickle in but</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.650" end="00:22:17.530" style="s2">no one&#39;s really interested I am in</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.530" end="00:22:21.730" style="s2">there&#39;s not only so much interest</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:23.220" style="s2">there&#39;s not extreme antagonism usually</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.730" end="00:22:26.100" style="s2">also just kind of like this indifference</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.220" end="00:22:28.500" style="s2">but the girls will be antagonism</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.100" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">revelation to some extent and that&#39;s why</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.190" end="00:23:28.890" style="s2">ends anyway or appeal to them using</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.250" end="00:23:31.710" style="s2">their their Telos or you know their goal</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.890" end="00:23:34.169" style="s2">their intention and and and ideally kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.710" end="00:23:38.090" style="s2">of like create something for them that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.169" end="00:23:43.559" style="s2">you know appeals to what they&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.090" end="00:23:48.390" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny this uh the image of the</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.390" end="00:23:54.900" style="s2">my experience right now and they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.710" end="00:23:56.669" style="s2">know I think I&#39;ve seen a number of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.900" end="00:23:58.530" style="s2">different instances where people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.669" end="00:23:59.850" style="s2">kind of seduced one of them is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.530" end="00:24:01.230" style="s2">the the back door of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.850" end="00:24:02.370" style="s2">presenting it as one thing when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.230" end="00:24:04.470" style="s2">actually something else so this would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.370" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">the you know the stoic breath or</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.470" end="00:24:07.980" style="s2">something like that and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:12.510" style="s2">setting up circumstances where people</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.980" end="00:24:13.830" style="s2">have to be in dialogue or in in relation</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.510" end="00:24:16.530" style="s2">with people that they normally wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.830" end="00:24:19.620" style="s2">be with and it&#39;s a very soft approach</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.530" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">and one that I think is you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.620" end="00:24:24.210" style="s2">essential it has to be part of the group</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:25.400" style="s2">anyway and then there&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.210" end="00:24:28.140" style="s2">that&#39;s let me be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.400" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">manipulative but also still has is still</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.140" end="00:24:32.909" style="s2">truthful in its own way and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">could possibly be valuable with some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.909" end="00:24:37.740" style="s2">the most combative tribes and that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:39.900" style="s2">just this that you know your enemy</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.900" end="00:24:44.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard a lot of stories of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.950" end="00:24:47.610" style="s2">being kind of stuck in one area or one</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.220" end="00:24:50.340" style="s2">ideological perspective with a clear</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.610" end="00:24:52.140" style="s2">idea of who their enemy is and wanting</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.340" end="00:24:53.730" style="s2">to figure out how to defeat them and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.140" end="00:24:55.020" style="s2">they kind of expose themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.730" end="00:24:56.670" style="s2">deliberately to their enemy to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.020" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">understand them and then kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.670" end="00:25:00.090" style="s2">out the other end realizing that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:01.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of assumptions that were</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.090" end="00:25:03.510" style="s2">being made that they didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.770" end="00:25:07.470" style="s2">understand you know there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.510" end="00:25:09.480" style="s2">provocative story of a a black jazz</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.480" end="00:25:13.500" style="s2">members and converting a bunch of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:15.690" style="s2">just because his curiosity of not</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:06.740" style="s2">and yesterday the basic idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.820" end="00:26:10.700" style="s2">just to to have a prior knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.740" end="00:26:17.309" style="s2">before we engage in a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.700" end="00:26:21.510" style="s2">so there&#39;s three major areas where this</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.309" end="00:26:24.980" style="s2">panelist could be so yeah like the first</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.510" end="00:26:24.980" style="s2">sorta forum so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.490" end="00:26:33.010" style="s2">and survivor this is depending for some</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.230" end="00:26:35.020" style="s2">time so it is same on a what&#39;s the video</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.010" end="00:26:37.330" style="s2">for you last week and work on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.020" end="00:26:37.809" style="s2">specifically for today so how it fits in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.330" end="00:26:41.400" style="s2">Soho</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.809" end="00:26:44.380" style="s2">so the first thing is what kind of forum</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.400" end="00:26:47.290" style="s2">so what is the aim to goal so do we need</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.380" end="00:26:55.480" style="s2">to arrive and something or just discuss</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.290" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">or then I&#39;m also the yes I have</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.480" end="00:26:58.420" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:02.690" style="s2">about how different truth processes</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.420" end="00:27:04.610" style="s2">works and so is some kind of agreement</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.690" end="00:27:08.630" style="s2">about that and then also like your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.610" end="00:27:10.100" style="s2">contribution and many of these things is</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.630" end="00:27:12.020" style="s2">not something you can just like we and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.100" end="00:27:19.460" style="s2">then no like you have to embody them</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.020" end="00:27:21.410" style="s2">like you also say so and yeah like so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.460" end="00:27:24.140" style="s2">not of learning in doing this but I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.390" end="00:27:34.760" style="s2">rational it&#39;s sensible it&#39;s made for</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.790" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">some project that as Aaron can hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.760" end="00:27:39.050" style="s2">agree on is is for the better good for</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.950" end="00:27:40.540" style="s2">the better conversation and yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.050" end="00:27:54.470" style="s2">be held to this standard so that as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.540" end="00:27:59.240" style="s2">standard that can hold you yes so a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.470" end="00:28:01.490" style="s2">couple of fragments are coming up so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.240" end="00:28:03.920" style="s2">like that sort of a training program of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.490" end="00:28:05.960" style="s2">medic mediation like maybe one step is</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.920" end="00:28:07.090" style="s2">to what was tracked what Connor and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.960" end="00:28:09.230" style="s2">track on that spreadsheet just</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.090" end="00:28:10.490" style="s2">propositional levels what they believed</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.230" end="00:28:12.440" style="s2">to be true so you can pass their</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.490" end="00:28:14.090" style="s2">ideological tutoring test and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.440" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">other step is to method act their</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.090" end="00:28:18.920" style="s2">reality tunnel so what do they feel when</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.760" end="00:28:20.390" style="s2">they believe what they believe right</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.920" end="00:28:22.520" style="s2">like what do they feel in their body and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.390" end="00:28:25.670" style="s2">then like have the capacity to process</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.520" end="00:28:26.870" style="s2">their I&#39;m in the position I feel quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.670" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">strongly about this that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.870" end="00:28:30.590" style="s2">really speak with anyone unless you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:31.670" style="s2">what they&#39;re feeling right if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.590" end="00:28:32.900" style="s2">their emotional reality because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.670" end="00:28:35.990" style="s2">just gonna misstep and say the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.900" end="00:28:37.990" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like I I like to have you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.990" end="00:28:41.000" style="s2">have maybe a training program emerging</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.990" end="00:28:44.180" style="s2">in a previous fragment that came up is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.000" end="00:28:47.300" style="s2">kind of like the battlefronts of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.180" end="00:28:48.980" style="s2">culture were like what are the hot spots</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.300" end="00:28:50.750" style="s2">right now and maybe have a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.980" end="00:28:55.100" style="s2">that like tracks that or some way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.750" end="00:28:56.390" style="s2">track that so like a real I&#39;ll mention</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.100" end="00:28:59.030" style="s2">one that I&#39;m concerned with right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.390" end="00:29:02.440" style="s2">but one that I&#39;m not too concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.030" end="00:29:04.670" style="s2">but it&#39;s a battlefront is trans medical</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.440" end="00:29:07.220" style="s2">astray ins trenders I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.670" end="00:29:09.010" style="s2">anyone is familiar with that so in like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.220" end="00:29:10.990" style="s2">the trans community there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.010" end="00:29:13.060" style="s2">people who think that you&#39;re only could</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.990" end="00:29:15.160" style="s2">be transgendered if you have gender</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.060" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">dysmorphia and then if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.160" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">that then you&#39;re just a transgender and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:19.780" style="s2">then they have like war between each</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:20.950" style="s2">other then contra points got involved in</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.780" end="00:29:22.380" style="s2">that I think she got sucked up in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.950" end="00:29:24.790" style="s2">little war</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.380" end="00:29:27.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a battlefront and maybe someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.790" end="00:29:28.780" style="s2">called to mediate between that so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.070" end="00:29:31.780" style="s2">could be a thing battlefront that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.780" end="00:29:33.640" style="s2">concerned about is the conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.780" end="00:29:36.370" style="s2">battlefront with Q and on and then how</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.640" end="00:29:37.960" style="s2">that&#39;s fractionating I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.370" end="00:29:40.200" style="s2">fuller David fuller from rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.960" end="00:29:44.740" style="s2">about this yesterday and it looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.200" end="00:29:46.180" style="s2">demon is being born through this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.740" end="00:29:47.800" style="s2">like collective dialogue and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.180" end="00:29:50.200" style="s2">trumpets movement is is associating with</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.800" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">it as well and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.200" end="00:29:53.860" style="s2">intelligent people in that community</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:57.340" style="s2">plugged into it so it&#39;d be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.860" end="00:29:58.930" style="s2">to have conversations there but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.340" end="00:30:00.670" style="s2">like the idea that there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.930" end="00:30:03.640" style="s2">like tracking system with all this and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.670" end="00:30:05.290" style="s2">then see whose call to mediate it like</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.640" end="00:30:07.960" style="s2">maybe people who can speak to both in</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.290" end="00:30:10.510" style="s2">such a way and the last thing I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.960" end="00:30:13.030" style="s2">is that I wrote this article with David</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.510" end="00:30:15.400" style="s2">Cosley called marginal figures and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.030" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">came up when Ben was talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.400" end="00:30:18.040" style="s2">marginal figures someone who has your</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:19.900" style="s2">foot in the tribe and the foot outside</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.040" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">of it but they&#39;re really respected by</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.900" end="00:30:23.410" style="s2">the tribe that they belong to and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:24.580" style="s2">you kinda remind me of that like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.410" end="00:30:26.050" style="s2">seem like a marginal figure in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.580" end="00:30:34.270" style="s2">tribe because you&#39;re plugged in you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.050" end="00:30:35.650" style="s2">you know but I think there is characters</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.270" end="00:30:37.420" style="s2">who can speak to their own tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.650" end="00:30:38.740" style="s2">then can speak outside of it too and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.420" end="00:30:40.540" style="s2">those are the kind of the figures that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.740" end="00:30:45.280" style="s2">we got to like find and then get them in</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.540" end="00:30:48.060" style="s2">this digital campfire well people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.280" end="00:30:53.290" style="s2">have gone from one tribe to another</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.060" end="00:31:04.120" style="s2">yeah bridge people exactly right my self</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.290" end="00:31:06.460" style="s2">not a faceless number that tells the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.120" end="00:31:08.470" style="s2">story of people who have shifted their</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.460" end="00:31:10.180" style="s2">political worldviews transcended</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.470" end="00:31:12.970" style="s2">extremism made all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.180" end="00:31:15.160" style="s2">transformative change those people are</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.970" end="00:31:17.560" style="s2">bridge people so yeah people who have</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.160" end="00:31:19.930" style="s2">shifted from one tribe to another can</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.560" end="00:31:22.570" style="s2">speak to the tribe they came from and to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.930" end="00:31:23.290" style="s2">the tribe they came to and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.570" end="00:31:25.030" style="s2">have the kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.290" end="00:31:28.930" style="s2">like meta just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.030" end="00:31:32.680" style="s2">understanding of tribes existing period</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.930" end="00:31:39.430" style="s2">so yeah those are very valuable voices</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.680" end="00:31:41.020" style="s2">cheer I would say I don&#39;t want to use</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.430" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">topic radically I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.020" end="00:31:45.040" style="s2">continuation I feel intuitively although</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:46.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t know exactly um just an</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.040" end="00:31:48.190" style="s2">experience that I had this week that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.690" end="00:31:50.040" style="s2">very much wanted that kind of presents</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.190" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">just to hear it also people&#39;s opinions</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.040" end="00:31:57.400" style="s2">this week I accidentally stumbled across</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:32:01.150" style="s2">a website called um I think it was the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.400" end="00:32:05.560" style="s2">internet into Intifada which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.150" end="00:32:07.870" style="s2">strong for Palestinian website and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.560" end="00:32:10.660" style="s2">not like a strong ideologist I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.870" end="00:32:11.920" style="s2">aware of the far before that is sort I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.660" end="00:32:15.430" style="s2">don&#39;t have a strong opinion anything on</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.920" end="00:32:16.690" style="s2">the Israeli passing in conflict or just</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.430" end="00:32:19.390" style="s2">being and seeing the things from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.690" end="00:32:20.920" style="s2">other perspective and seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.390" end="00:32:22.630" style="s2">radically different mins shock my system</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.920" end="00:32:25.030" style="s2">in a body way things I knew</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.630" end="00:32:27.730" style="s2">intellectually experienced otherwise but</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.030" end="00:32:29.650" style="s2">one thing that struck me very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.730" end="00:32:32.980" style="s2">and connecting to the mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.650" end="00:32:37.030" style="s2">is that I felt like the argument on all</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.980" end="00:32:40.530" style="s2">sides almost oil down to the facts in</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.030" end="00:32:43.450" style="s2">the sense that every side if they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.530" end="00:32:44.590" style="s2">charged like no we don&#39;t do that if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.450" end="00:32:46.660" style="s2">did do that we&#39;d be terrible people but</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.590" end="00:32:47.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t do that where that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.660" end="00:32:49.180" style="s2">the perspective everything and I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.920" end="00:32:53.080" style="s2">kind of thinking about a memetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.180" end="00:32:54.820" style="s2">mediation in general we have people with</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.080" end="00:32:57.010" style="s2">these um so strong strongly different</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.820" end="00:32:58.330" style="s2">values or maybe it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.010" end="00:33:00.820" style="s2">difference in values maybes difference</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.330" end="00:33:02.710" style="s2">of interpretation of objective facts and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.820" end="00:33:05.320" style="s2">maybe they can kind of connect like we</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.710" end="00:33:07.510" style="s2">all want social justice right we all</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.320" end="00:33:10.930" style="s2">want people to be treated equally and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.510" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">nicely and humanely well what that means</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.930" end="00:33:14.020" style="s2">because of the facts a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:17.700" style="s2">different I wonder how that could kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.020" end="00:33:17.700" style="s2">of flow in</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.350" end="00:33:25.030" style="s2">what popped into my head been fun as you</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.110" end="00:33:28.299" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about that is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.030" end="00:33:31.000" style="s2">from Virgil a coffee and she wrote</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.299" end="00:33:35.460" style="s2">something that this was more in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.000" end="00:33:39.250" style="s2">the larger conservative versus liberal</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.460" end="00:33:41.799" style="s2">idea but the idea of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.250" end="00:33:44.740" style="s2">metaphorical models that each side had</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.799" end="00:33:46.270" style="s2">and it was a difference not invalid it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.740" end="00:33:48.460" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a different and difference in</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.270" end="00:33:50.650" style="s2">values but a difference in ordering of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.460" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">the values they had the same values they</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.650" end="00:33:57.669" style="s2">just ordered them slightly different and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:34:00.040" style="s2">that slight difference what was big you</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.669" end="00:34:01.330" style="s2">know made a huge difference and I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.040" end="00:34:02.740" style="s2">trying to think of off the top of my</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.330" end="00:34:05.890" style="s2">head I mean it&#39;s like they both valued</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.740" end="00:34:11.619" style="s2">love but how they expressed that love</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.890" end="00:34:13.389" style="s2">was or yeah compassion like for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.619" end="00:34:16.389" style="s2">conservative it was more of the strict</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.389" end="00:34:18.429" style="s2">father type of compassion whereas for</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.389" end="00:34:21.990" style="s2">liberals it was more of like the you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.429" end="00:34:24.580" style="s2">know compassionate mother type of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.990" end="00:34:25.600" style="s2">underlying models that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.580" end="00:34:27.790" style="s2">what I thought of as we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.600" end="00:34:29.590" style="s2">about that because it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.790" end="00:34:32.379" style="s2">so interesting is that the differences</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.590" end="00:34:34.419" style="s2">are slight I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s the ordering</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.379" end="00:34:36.040" style="s2">of values it&#39;s not that the values are</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.419" end="00:34:39.820" style="s2">very different it&#39;s just the order that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.040" end="00:34:42.030" style="s2">we that people put them in and how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.820" end="00:34:45.129" style="s2">you how do you bring that to the surface</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.030" end="00:34:48.310" style="s2">that&#39;s really really good what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.129" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">to mind the term a protein a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.310" end="00:34:53.320" style="s2">superordinate goal so the superordinate</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:54.700" style="s2">goal always shifts depending on what</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.320" end="00:34:57.160" style="s2">kind of the conversation you want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.700" end="00:34:59.619" style="s2">emerge and when you were talking what</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.160" end="00:35:01.960" style="s2">came to mind is that I had this event in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.619" end="00:35:05.260" style="s2">person lined up supposed to be about</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.960" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">mate but Cove it happened and it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:08.200" style="s2">extinction rebellion the representatives</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:10.359" style="s2">of extinction rebellions in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.200" end="00:35:13.270" style="s2">talking with the effect of altruist</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.359" end="00:35:14.980" style="s2">community because they have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.270" end="00:35:16.330" style="s2">super ordinate goal they want to save</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.980" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">the world you know respond to the medic</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.330" end="00:35:19.780" style="s2">Rice&#39;s but the responses are radically</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:21.940" style="s2">different and just having them together</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.780" end="00:35:25.869" style="s2">to chat would be nice build some bridges</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.940" end="00:35:28.420" style="s2">there maybe I&#39;ll do it online and stow</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.869" end="00:35:29.859" style="s2">it now but I like that idea of if it</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.420" end="00:35:30.490" style="s2">kind of sniffing out those battlefronts</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.859" end="00:35:32.200" style="s2">and then saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.490" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">what is the the framing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.200" end="00:35:39.849" style="s2">gonna track both of them to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:42.910" style="s2">the campfire what&#39;s coming to mind right</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.849" end="00:35:45.609" style="s2">now is is like what you know for for</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.910" end="00:35:48.910" style="s2">kind of self-styled medic mediators what</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.609" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">does it mean to be a trustworthy person</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.910" end="00:35:54.910" style="s2">who can build trust in certain</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:56.859" style="s2">communities as somebody that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.910" end="00:35:59.349" style="s2">still maybe you&#39;re not even a marginal</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.859" end="00:36:00.940" style="s2">figure you&#39;re just they&#39;ll tolerate you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.349" end="00:36:02.380" style="s2">you know being part of their</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.940" end="00:36:04.300" style="s2">conversational space because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.380" end="00:36:06.970" style="s2">attacking them and you know and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.300" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">friendly with them and but you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.970" end="00:36:13.810" style="s2">person that you know they they come to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:15.570" style="s2">rely on to one translate ideas and memes</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.810" end="00:36:18.369" style="s2">from other tribes from the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.570" end="00:36:20.920" style="s2">but they also see you as an asset in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.369" end="00:36:23.980" style="s2">way that well you know maybe they will</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.920" end="00:36:26.710" style="s2">represent our worldview sympathetically</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.980" end="00:36:29.710" style="s2">to the outside world and so as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.710" end="00:36:32.830" style="s2">mediator you know one thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.710" end="00:36:36.849" style="s2">like you know that I think about is okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.830" end="00:36:40.119" style="s2">which which tribes do I feel even</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.849" end="00:36:41.500" style="s2">remotely qualified to even build trust</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.119" end="00:36:43.480" style="s2">within because I don&#39;t think any of us</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.500" end="00:36:45.730" style="s2">can cover the whole range right we you</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.480" end="00:36:48.339" style="s2">know with limited time energy and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.730" end="00:36:51.670" style="s2">just you know like our life experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.339" end="00:36:53.410" style="s2">precludes us from I think sympathizing</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.670" end="00:36:55.900" style="s2">with everything right unless we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.410" end="00:36:57.130" style="s2">completely Zen about everything and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.900" end="00:36:58.270" style="s2">actually don&#39;t really understand it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.130" end="00:36:59.500" style="s2">we&#39;re just you know we&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.270" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">getting into the meat of it we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.500" end="00:37:10.300" style="s2">you know floating around sorry dude</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:13.960" style="s2">attack on you maybe it was anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.300" end="00:37:16.030" style="s2">yeah this is more of like a an inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.960" end="00:37:18.040" style="s2">prompt of like you know we think about</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.030" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">okay which groups can we build</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.040" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">relationships with a couple people one</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:24.940" style="s2">or two people in the group you know in</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:27.430" style="s2">order to when things flare up you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.940" end="00:37:29.080" style="s2">you&#39;re you you know because if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.430" end="00:37:30.540" style="s2">no if there&#39;s no battle line if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.080" end="00:37:32.619" style="s2">just different worldviews and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.540" end="00:37:34.690" style="s2">coexisting peacefully then well you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.619" end="00:37:36.670" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s not really a big deal if</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.690" end="00:37:38.980" style="s2">they&#39;re if they&#39;re pretty separated but</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.670" end="00:37:42.310" style="s2">when things flare up all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.980" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">know like you&#39;re well positioned to to</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.310" end="00:37:47.530" style="s2">be a mediator to translate you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:49.390" style="s2">intentions and goals and values and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.530" end="00:37:54.670" style="s2">facts and everything else among these</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.390" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">groups yeah it&#39;d be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.670" end="00:38:02.190" style="s2">contrarian here and I guess kind of on</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">this broader theme I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.190" end="00:38:06.250" style="s2">mediation the first kind of connotation</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:08.740" style="s2">with mediation is is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.250" end="00:38:11.020" style="s2">peacekeeping effort of you know meeting</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.740" end="00:38:15.970" style="s2">when mediation is needed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.020" end="00:38:18.610" style="s2">obvious and I think I actually have my</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.970" end="00:38:21.160" style="s2">intuition well I think both it&#39;s true in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.610" end="00:38:23.350" style="s2">many ways I also think it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.160" end="00:38:25.690" style="s2">kind of like a last-ditch effort in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.350" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">sense that most of the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.690" end="00:38:31.390" style="s2">mediation that I see is happening when</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:33.310" style="s2">the mediation isn&#39;t known about so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.390" end="00:38:34.600" style="s2">kind of like very Taoist in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.310" end="00:38:37.360" style="s2">like the best leaders the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.600" end="00:38:41.140" style="s2">don&#39;t nobody knows they&#39;re leading and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.360" end="00:38:43.630" style="s2">you know so so so a lot of times that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.140" end="00:38:44.950" style="s2">might look like so we&#39;ve brought up a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.630" end="00:38:46.090" style="s2">couple of her things like one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.950" end="00:38:50.040" style="s2">like if there&#39;s just fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.090" end="00:38:55.260" style="s2">disagreements on what is true I I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.040" end="00:38:57.370" style="s2">skeptical of of making any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.260" end="00:38:59.410" style="s2">conflict you know conflicting and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.370" end="00:39:01.240" style="s2">investigation into breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.410" end="00:39:02.620" style="s2">barriers and actually I think in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.240" end="00:39:06.130" style="s2">of cases it actually just makes them</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.620" end="00:39:07.180" style="s2">stronger and what what tends to be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.130" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">most interesting for me and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.180" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">Jason and I do is a lot on both hand is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:13.870" style="s2">to have people on the podcast who have</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:16.180" style="s2">strong beliefs and take a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.870" end="00:39:18.550" style="s2">interest obviously I think this is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.180" end="00:39:21.070" style="s2">core here we have no agenda</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.550" end="00:39:23.800" style="s2">but kind of exploring the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.070" end="00:39:25.690" style="s2">those beliefs and trying to maybe kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.800" end="00:39:27.310" style="s2">of loosen them a little bit play with</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.690" end="00:39:28.810" style="s2">you know where there&#39;s some paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.310" end="00:39:31.960" style="s2">might come up with where some</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.810" end="00:39:33.880" style="s2">uncertainty starts to be engaged and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.960" end="00:39:36.370" style="s2">you know sparking maybe some curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.880" end="00:39:37.600" style="s2">of what&#39;s beyond those boundaries or how</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.370" end="00:39:40.270" style="s2">somebody else might see it differently</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.600" end="00:39:42.030" style="s2">so yeah I guess the the the provocative</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.270" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">claim here is that I think most of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.030" end="00:39:46.990" style="s2">effective mediation that I feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:49.960" style="s2">happening when it&#39;s happening is when</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.990" end="00:39:52.350" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s not seen as mediation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.960" end="00:39:55.990" style="s2">just a CO exploration and relational</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.350" end="00:39:57.190" style="s2">kind of dialogue or interaction and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.990" end="00:39:57.970" style="s2">mean it doesn&#39;t even have to be dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.190" end="00:40:00.830" style="s2">you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.970" end="00:40:02.630" style="s2">you know to get into our body embodied</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.830" end="00:40:05.300" style="s2">space I&#39;ve definitely danced with people</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.630" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">where they got to push me out of my you</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.300" end="00:40:08.870" style="s2">know my preconceived notions of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:10.580" style="s2">dancing is or something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.870" end="00:40:12.650" style="s2">like that this is something that that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.580" end="00:40:15.890" style="s2">unfolding on many different levels and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.650" end="00:40:18.770" style="s2">really it&#39;s kind of relationally pushing</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.890" end="00:40:21.950" style="s2">the boundaries of kind of concrete ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.770" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">of where where things ended began yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.950" end="00:40:32.170" style="s2">something throw out there jump in here</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:32.170" style="s2">and say wow you guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.830" end="00:40:37.160" style="s2">before I lose myself completely I just</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.150" end="00:40:43.670" style="s2">want to get under the floor but I love</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.160" end="00:40:48.890" style="s2">the idea of the weather reports but</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.890" end="00:40:54.680" style="s2">place but rather than for it but</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.080" end="00:40:57.050" style="s2">speaking for yourself and so that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.680" end="00:41:01.970" style="s2">transparency of your your own inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.050" end="00:41:04.100" style="s2">could be there and jeredy like what</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.970" end="00:41:06.410" style="s2">you&#39;re saying just let me be about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.100" end="00:41:08.359" style="s2">not going directly for it but indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.410" end="00:41:10.280" style="s2">and even to really follow that to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.359" end="00:41:13.940" style="s2">extreme if you did something like action</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.280" end="00:41:17.060" style="s2">learning and really support people from</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.940" end="00:41:20.119" style="s2">one of those tribes to have with a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.060" end="00:41:22.609" style="s2">problem to voice that problem to mask</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.119" end="00:41:26.210" style="s2">clarifying questions about it and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.609" end="00:41:28.490" style="s2">then to to look to add resources and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.210" end="00:41:30.980" style="s2">support for that for that to happen to</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.490" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">make it a really safe place but the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.980" end="00:41:36.290" style="s2">space would be a lot connected er and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:37.850" style="s2">safer when we speak you know our own</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.290" end="00:41:39.650" style="s2">truth with the weather reports and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.850" end="00:41:42.200" style="s2">really make that safe and Invitational</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.650" end="00:41:44.840" style="s2">for people to do it rather than having</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.200" end="00:41:46.460" style="s2">them sort of labeled with their their</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.840" end="00:41:48.170" style="s2">tribe and I loved it with the writing</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.460" end="00:41:49.880" style="s2">exercise that&#39;s definitely started off</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.170" end="00:41:52.390" style="s2">like big that&#39;s fantastic and it would</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.880" end="00:41:52.390" style="s2">really be good</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.270" end="00:41:55.330" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:42:02.260" style="s2">Tyson did you have something you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.880" end="00:42:04.059" style="s2">to say I think so I&#39;m interested in sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.260" end="00:42:08.410" style="s2">of invoking a conflict that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.059" end="00:42:10.390" style="s2">experienced and then seeing what happens</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.410" end="00:42:13.750" style="s2">from that for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.390" end="00:42:15.339" style="s2">I allowed of people that I am either</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.750" end="00:42:17.530" style="s2">friends with or just acquaintances or</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.339" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">friends of friends on Facebook all right</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.530" end="00:42:22.990" style="s2">like a lot of their biggest concerns</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:27.220" style="s2">revolve around like max vaccinations and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.990" end="00:42:28.839" style="s2">5g and so there are like essence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.220" end="00:42:31.539" style="s2">there&#39;s some of it which just seems like</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.839" end="00:42:34.750" style="s2">a lot of sensational conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.539" end="00:42:38.710" style="s2">and there&#39;s other things that also scare</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.750" end="00:42:40.150" style="s2">me quite a lot and then I also I feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.710" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">like I&#39;m coming from a tribe that would</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.150" end="00:42:45.549" style="s2">have like their their forebears would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:48.789" style="s2">like Eckart Tolle and other spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.549" end="00:42:50.530" style="s2">teachers and I&#39;m coming more and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.789" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">also they&#39;re very much about like get</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.530" end="00:42:53.410" style="s2">out of your head and into your body like</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:54.700" style="s2">out of your head out of your head it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.410" end="00:42:58.690" style="s2">like to be in your head into think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.700" end="00:43:00.760" style="s2">like that&#39;s almost like the sin and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.690" end="00:43:02.230" style="s2">I&#39;d really like to use my mind and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.760" end="00:43:04.210" style="s2">to think and be in conversations like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.230" end="00:43:10.750" style="s2">this so this is a tribe that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.210" end="00:43:12.250" style="s2">attracted to and so and then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.750" end="00:43:14.650" style="s2">people that I see that are thinking very</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.250" end="00:43:17.230" style="s2">thoughtfully and that I see is being</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.650" end="00:43:22.029" style="s2">very intelligent and smart are very</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.230" end="00:43:23.470" style="s2">strong against anti-vaxxers so like sam</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.029" end="00:43:24.849" style="s2">harris is an example of someone i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.470" end="00:43:26.680" style="s2">is a brilliant mind he&#39;s very thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.849" end="00:43:29.559" style="s2">about things and he talks about being an</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.680" end="00:43:33.849" style="s2">anti-vaxxers like this horrible person</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.559" end="00:43:35.470" style="s2">or something and so that and so but like</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.849" end="00:43:38.109" style="s2">max vaccinations scare me quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.470" end="00:43:41.650" style="s2">but I also I would be very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.109" end="00:43:45.180" style="s2">like hearing from somebody that is much</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.650" end="00:43:47.079" style="s2">more equipped than me an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.180" end="00:43:48.609" style="s2">vaccinations and how they&#39;re done and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.079" end="00:43:50.140" style="s2">why they can be done safely and how they</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.609" end="00:43:51.819" style="s2">can be done safely and how we could have</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.140" end="00:43:56.140" style="s2">vaccinations with that and not have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.819" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">have the fear um and I yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.140" end="00:43:59.289" style="s2">something that when I think about it I</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:00.940" style="s2">almost want to like kind of hide from it</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.289" end="00:44:03.029" style="s2">because it it does that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.940" end="00:44:05.289" style="s2">scares me and I also fear like</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.029" end="00:44:07.869" style="s2">disconnection from some of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.289" end="00:44:09.970" style="s2">people that I care about my relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.869" end="00:44:11.950" style="s2">with them and so I see how some</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.970" end="00:44:14.710" style="s2">that conversation as well for them would</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.950" end="00:44:20.170" style="s2">be difficult to have in a like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.710" end="00:44:21.670" style="s2">grounded space you&#39;re not trying to I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.170" end="00:44:24.340" style="s2">would think of that using like the max</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.670" end="00:44:26.530" style="s2">back kind of thing is that some that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.340" end="00:44:29.080" style="s2">understand my space and also in the end</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.530" end="00:44:32.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve acts I have been derided accent so</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.080" end="00:44:35.320" style="s2">we get his paradox where I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.320" end="00:44:36.940" style="s2">also true anybody who is informed is own</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.320" end="00:44:39.310" style="s2">pretty much informed because they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.940" end="00:44:40.599" style="s2">strong proponent of one side like if</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.310" end="00:44:42.070" style="s2">anybody that really knows their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.599" end="00:44:43.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not they came in knowing their</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.070" end="00:44:46.180" style="s2">stuff became with the strong opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.540" end="00:44:48.580" style="s2">that&#39;s how Andy kept that amassing the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.180" end="00:44:49.450" style="s2">information that sustains them and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.580" end="00:44:52.119" style="s2">don&#39;t even have people who are really</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.450" end="00:44:54.010" style="s2">kind of like you and I also say many</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.119" end="00:44:56.080" style="s2">things like agnostic like I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.010" end="00:44:59.170" style="s2">know you can&#39;t do the food you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.080" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">trust the experts even because basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.170" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">they started in that direction anyway</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">I&#39;m just adding to your IRA you should</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:18.250" style="s2">and I will just just say here to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.510" end="00:45:20.260" style="s2">this is these these groups out so I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.250" end="00:45:22.900" style="s2">some some conspiracy folks in my family</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.260" end="00:45:26.980" style="s2">and stuff like that and and yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.900" end="00:45:28.869" style="s2">that every time somebody else in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.980" end="00:45:31.420" style="s2">family tries to disprove them or argue</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.869" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">with them it just is always a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.420" end="00:45:35.050" style="s2">and and this is would be you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:36.420" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of talked about two things</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.050" end="00:45:38.920" style="s2">one of them one of them being that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.420" end="00:45:40.810" style="s2">genetic mediators really benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.920" end="00:45:42.010" style="s2">having frightened previous tribal</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.810" end="00:45:43.720" style="s2">experience so that they can relate</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.010" end="00:45:46.119" style="s2">increase and rapport with the people and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.720" end="00:45:48.970" style="s2">some trusts to explore but I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.119" end="00:45:51.750" style="s2">there&#39;s also an equally interesting role</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.970" end="00:45:55.060" style="s2">which is the the curious ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.750" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">perspective and but it has to be true</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.060" end="00:45:58.990" style="s2">like right you can&#39;t be like I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:00.670" style="s2">you can&#39;t be the socratic I&#39;m gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.990" end="00:46:03.010" style="s2">you questions until you look stupid</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.670" end="00:46:06.310" style="s2">it has to be like a genuine exploration</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.010" end="00:46:08.650" style="s2">of the boundaries from somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.310" end="00:46:11.589" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know anything and if you if</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.650" end="00:46:14.200" style="s2">you&#39;re able to dialogue long enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.589" end="00:46:17.349" style="s2">you&#39;ll always end up at I don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.200" end="00:46:18.849" style="s2">if a conversation ends with an ideologue</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.349" end="00:46:20.349" style="s2">with and I don&#39;t know I feel like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.849" end="00:46:22.930" style="s2">always some mediation has happened to</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.349" end="00:46:25.349" style="s2">there it&#39;s kind of loosened loosen the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.930" end="00:46:25.349" style="s2">grip of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.390" end="00:46:34.970" style="s2">Jason yet something say I mean a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:37.130" style="s2">like quarterly formed thought so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.970" end="00:46:39.140" style="s2">see well I was just thinking how you</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.130" end="00:46:41.600" style="s2">know we&#39;re all very I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.140" end="00:46:44.420" style="s2">multifaceted not just in this group but</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.600" end="00:46:47.150" style="s2">everyone and if we do have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.420" end="00:46:48.530" style="s2">coherent worldview it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.150" end="00:46:50.840" style="s2">composite board of many different</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.530" end="00:46:53.780" style="s2">influences that we kind of figured out</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.840" end="00:46:56.300" style="s2">how to stitch together and well you were</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.780" end="00:47:00.380" style="s2">saying Jared about you know just just</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.300" end="00:47:02.780" style="s2">simply inquiring in good faith and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.380" end="00:47:04.970" style="s2">know not not trying to prove anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.780" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">but just you&#39;re building up some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.970" end="00:47:08.390" style="s2">rapport and and and that might not lead</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:09.740" style="s2">anywhere on that particular issue but</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.390" end="00:47:13.010" style="s2">just building up that rapport with that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.740" end="00:47:14.450" style="s2">person on some other issue you know all</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.010" end="00:47:17.600" style="s2">of a sudden you have some trust built</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.450" end="00:47:20.210" style="s2">that you know perhaps some mediation can</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.600" end="00:47:24.410" style="s2">happen you know down the line right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.210" end="00:47:26.120" style="s2">so again I&#39;m going back to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.410" end="00:47:29.090" style="s2">embodiment and relationship you know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.120" end="00:47:31.310" style="s2">really think that&#39;s that&#39;s really you</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.090" end="00:47:34.280" style="s2">know the driver of memetic mediation is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.310" end="00:47:37.010" style="s2">is just good old fashioned relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.280" end="00:47:39.110" style="s2">building finding some area where you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.010" end="00:47:40.670" style="s2">connect you know and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.110" end="00:47:43.510" style="s2">impossible not to find some area that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.670" end="00:47:45.770" style="s2">you can connect with somebody right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.510" end="00:47:48.830" style="s2">starting starting from that foundation</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.770" end="00:47:50.750" style="s2">and then you know when you start getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.830" end="00:47:53.270" style="s2">into the more sensitive issues you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.750" end="00:47:54.470" style="s2">a little bit more affordance do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.270" end="00:47:56.980" style="s2">without everyone just shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.470" end="00:47:56.980" style="s2">immediately</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.550" end="00:48:01.700" style="s2">well in to add to that I know Jason you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.200" end="00:48:03.230" style="s2">like to talk a lot about how the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.700" end="00:48:05.780" style="s2">mediation is kind of a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.230" end="00:48:08.120" style="s2">practice as well and and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.780" end="00:48:11.810" style="s2">spiritual component comes in here about</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.120" end="00:48:14.780" style="s2">when it comes to in these in these these</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.810" end="00:48:16.220" style="s2">attempts to have relational dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.780" end="00:48:18.950" style="s2">with somebody that you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.220" end="00:48:21.830" style="s2">bunch of familiarity with if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.950" end="00:48:23.450" style="s2">metacognitively aware of when some sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.830" end="00:48:26.570" style="s2">of emotional strong emotional reaction</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.450" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">comes up that is you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.570" end="00:48:29.860" style="s2">practice of its own in its own is</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:34.490" style="s2">showing you that there is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.860" end="00:48:37.690" style="s2">preconception or solid idea about this</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.490" end="00:48:40.360" style="s2">topic that then can be kind of explored</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.690" end="00:48:42.130" style="s2">and and the tricky thing here too and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.360" end="00:48:44.080" style="s2">can be hard sometimes to do it while</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.130" end="00:48:45.730" style="s2">you&#39;re in the conversation but I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.080" end="00:48:47.140" style="s2">it&#39;s always really important to after</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.730" end="00:48:49.510" style="s2">you&#39;ve kind of come out of something if</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.140" end="00:48:51.580" style="s2">you felt like you came out triggered to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.510" end="00:48:53.620" style="s2">then just get back into your body and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.580" end="00:48:55.450" style="s2">feel what with where that triggering is</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.620" end="00:48:58.210" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s my shoulders are</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.450" end="00:49:00.490" style="s2">super tense or feeling anger or you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.210" end="00:49:03.340" style="s2">that they may have like however it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.490" end="00:49:04.840" style="s2">presents like exploring that in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.340" end="00:49:07.150" style="s2">curious way as opposed to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.840" end="00:49:09.820" style="s2">resistant way is what because is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.150" end="00:49:12.520" style="s2">actually loosening it and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.820" end="00:49:14.770" style="s2">counter-intuitively you know like when</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.520" end="00:49:17.380" style="s2">we see how much that emotional resonance</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.770" end="00:49:20.080" style="s2">is kind of what is creating the barriers</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.380" end="00:49:22.060" style="s2">and boundaries then we know that the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.080" end="00:49:23.770" style="s2">to deconstruct them is also to get into</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.060" end="00:49:25.960" style="s2">our bodies as well and kind of explore</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.770" end="00:49:27.820" style="s2">that the sensations and in the more we</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.960" end="00:49:30.460" style="s2">do it too the more you start to see that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.820" end="00:49:33.310" style="s2">these solid ideas that feel solid in our</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.460" end="00:49:34.810" style="s2">body as well if you look closely you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.310" end="00:49:36.070" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of movement there kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.810" end="00:49:37.810" style="s2">of exploring the boundaries and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.070" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">like that it&#39;s surprising how much this</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.810" end="00:49:41.950" style="s2">actually affects our cognition but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:43.450" style="s2">definitely a spiritual practice you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.950" end="00:49:45.880" style="s2">this is a lot of what meditation is all</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.450" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">about yeah mediators also need to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.880" end="00:49:51.910" style="s2">mediated right I think we could be Pro</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:54.820" style="s2">mediators in some domains and complete</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.910" end="00:49:56.740" style="s2">you know you know culture warriors and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.820" end="00:50:00.040" style="s2">other domains you know I I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.740" end="00:50:03.100" style="s2">you know still do my share of of warring</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.040" end="00:50:05.260" style="s2">on the Internet&#39;s and you know I rely on</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.100" end="00:50:09.520" style="s2">my budge to point out my blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.260" end="00:50:11.500" style="s2">right and the reason I I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.520" end="00:50:14.500" style="s2">spiritual practice is you know it does</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.500" end="00:50:16.060" style="s2">require humility and you know like as</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.500" end="00:50:17.860" style="s2">we&#39;re mediating we&#39;re also being</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.060" end="00:50:20.020" style="s2">mediated even if it&#39;s not by somebody</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.860" end="00:50:22.660" style="s2">else like we&#39;re also have to go in with</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.020" end="00:50:24.040" style="s2">the spirit of learning because we might</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.660" end="00:50:25.270" style="s2">have blind spots right and as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.040" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">trying to mediate somebody else we might</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.270" end="00:50:30.730" style="s2">also you know get triggered and then we</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:33.340" style="s2">have to emotionally process that and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.730" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">know our sense of identity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.340" end="00:50:36.970" style="s2">attached to a worldview has to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:39.730" style="s2">loosened and that&#39;s you know to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.970" end="00:50:40.900" style="s2">that&#39;s spirituality 101 right is you</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.730" end="00:50:43.660" style="s2">know your sense of identity keeps</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.900" end="00:50:45.070" style="s2">getting bigger and expanding and or you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.660" end="00:50:48.490" style="s2">know depending on how you want to phrase</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.070" end="00:50:50.619" style="s2">it but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it takes less</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.490" end="00:50:53.380" style="s2">solid forms right it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.619" end="00:50:57.519" style="s2">it&#39;s more nebulous I guess you could say</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.380" end="00:50:59.890" style="s2">more non-dual right I feel called to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.519" end="00:51:02.589" style="s2">something is that the nice edge of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.890" end="00:51:07.930" style="s2">thinking and then I&#39;ll stop talking and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.589" end="00:51:11.380" style="s2">then close up I like this idea of really</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.930" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">like seeing like the logical end and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.380" end="00:51:14.890" style="s2">emotional end or the conclusion of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:17.259" style="s2">that have tribe and going there and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.890" end="00:51:18.970" style="s2">going all the way with it and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.259" end="00:51:20.440" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you one one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.970" end="00:51:22.809" style="s2">happened to me when I research these</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.440" end="00:51:23.619" style="s2">tribes I try to feel them too and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.809" end="00:51:26.200" style="s2">when I was researching all these</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.619" end="00:51:27.640" style="s2">conspiracy theory tribes you know like</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.200" end="00:51:29.619" style="s2">fired up the tor browser and just</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.640" end="00:51:31.710" style="s2">started reading like this like non-stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.619" end="00:51:33.940" style="s2">reading about all this type of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.710" end="00:51:35.380" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna talk about the accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.940" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">because I do think there&#39;s signal to</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.380" end="00:51:39.309" style="s2">some of that I think a lot of us noise</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.640" end="00:51:41.740" style="s2">though but just the spirit the essence</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.309" end="00:51:44.529" style="s2">of it cuz when you read that you become</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.740" end="00:51:46.299" style="s2">radically paranoid you can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.529" end="00:51:47.710" style="s2">anyone can&#39;t trust any of your loved</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.299" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">ones you can&#39;t even trust yourself I</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.710" end="00:51:51.519" style="s2">remember a thought according my mind my</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">and my and killed her agent feels like</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.519" end="00:51:55.960" style="s2">you just come radically paranoid and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:51:57.999" style="s2">then that&#39;s an opportunity to build a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.960" end="00:52:00.249" style="s2">state a relationship with that state of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.999" end="00:52:01.809" style="s2">radical paranoia at the end of the nice</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.249" end="00:52:04.809" style="s2">edge of my thinking I&#39;m thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.809" end="00:52:07.329" style="s2">the Depok that conspiracy theory energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.809" end="00:52:13.329" style="s2">is like the death of communitas for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.329" end="00:52:15.039" style="s2">collective and yeah I&#39;ll just let that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.329" end="00:52:17.519" style="s2">sit for a moment and see if anybody has</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.039" end="00:52:17.519" style="s2">anything to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.020" end="00:52:30.620" style="s2">things come to mind I last year went</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.460" end="00:52:32.810" style="s2">into a foray down into the Chan&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.620" end="00:52:34.850" style="s2">like yeah I had that same experience of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.810" end="00:52:37.960" style="s2">the paranoia and go and and being</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.850" end="00:52:40.070" style="s2">introduced to like oh my god these are</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.960" end="00:52:42.050" style="s2">like there were things that came up and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.070" end="00:52:46.070" style="s2">I was like okay I need to slowly back</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.050" end="00:52:48.710" style="s2">away from this and get right get in</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.070" end="00:52:51.410" style="s2">relationship with myself and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.710" end="00:52:54.650" style="s2">there I like that framing of being able</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.410" end="00:52:58.250" style="s2">to be in relationship to that paranoia</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.650" end="00:53:00.200" style="s2">because how can you converse with</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.250" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">somebody if you can&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.200" end="00:53:07.700" style="s2">feeling of where they&#39;re coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:11.090" style="s2">the other thing is I clicked a glance at</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.700" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">the document that you put out Peter of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.090" end="00:53:16.370" style="s2">and the term connection Jim&#39;s and this</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:19.070" style="s2">thought that has my husband and I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.370" end="00:53:26.830" style="s2">had this thing of like it&#39;s an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.070" end="00:53:30.350" style="s2">dojo of being able to do you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.830" end="00:53:32.630" style="s2">my my biggest fear is getting people is</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.350" end="00:53:36.680" style="s2">someone getting angry at me I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.630" end="00:53:38.390" style="s2">necessarily like like I could prop there</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.680" end="00:53:41.990" style="s2">are probably situations where I could</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.390" end="00:53:43.910" style="s2">push a little bit harder but I&#39;m too but</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.990" end="00:53:46.610" style="s2">I&#39;m scared of the response and so a</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.910" end="00:53:50.930" style="s2">situation in which like that could be</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.610" end="00:53:53.380" style="s2">like tested and try and practice I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.930" end="00:53:57.530" style="s2">like there&#39;s this part of me that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.380" end="00:53:59.420" style="s2">you know wanting to figure out how can I</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.530" end="00:54:02.890" style="s2">make something like that come to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.420" end="00:54:06.890" style="s2">fruition as being able to practice that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.890" end="00:54:09.200" style="s2">because being able to yeah beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.890" end="00:54:11.660" style="s2">knife&#39;s edge of like okay Ken how far</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.200" end="00:54:15.020" style="s2">can i push before it pushed somebody too</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.660" end="00:54:17.930" style="s2">hard I mean and they were coil but</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.020" end="00:54:19.450" style="s2">without like getting intimidated talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.930" end="00:54:22.700" style="s2">out of it by my own</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.450" end="00:54:24.890" style="s2">you know fear of other people&#39;s anger so</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.700" end="00:54:28.460" style="s2">something yeah I&#39;d love to see something</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.890" end="00:54:31.100" style="s2">like that and my minds kind of working</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.460" end="00:54:33.260" style="s2">on how can I do I have the courage to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.100" end="00:54:34.460" style="s2">something to try and set something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.260" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">that up</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.460" end="00:54:40.040" style="s2">I have a desire to double click on your</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:41.510" style="s2">daemon kara and so I had a similar</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.040" end="00:54:42.800" style="s2">thought so this what&#39;s what&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.510" end="00:54:44.420" style="s2">of the stores gonna be like a wisdom gym</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.800" end="00:54:47.390" style="s2">I imagine where we can practice all</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.420" end="00:54:49.330" style="s2">these things and I don&#39;t have anyone</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.390" end="00:54:51.890" style="s2">heard about emotional effective patterns</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.330" end="00:54:54.650" style="s2">it&#39;s an acting technique in order not to</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.890" end="00:54:56.060" style="s2">get trauma when you when you do method</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.650" end="00:54:57.650" style="s2">acting an actual acting technique you</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.060" end="00:54:59.599" style="s2">can do breathing patterns where you hold</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.650" end="00:55:02.390" style="s2">yourself in a certain way and then if</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.599" end="00:55:05.210" style="s2">you breathe in that way reliably you</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.390" end="00:55:06.470" style="s2">engender certain emotional state and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.210" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">like if you want joy you kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.470" end="00:55:09.260" style="s2">close your eyes you have a smile and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:14.030" style="s2">have a cascaded breathing through your</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.260" end="00:55:15.800" style="s2">nostrils and you do that then just joy</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.030" end="00:55:17.150" style="s2">just arts bubbling up and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.800" end="00:55:18.440" style="s2">build a relationship with that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.150" end="00:55:20.210" style="s2">that with fear you know that with anger</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.440" end="00:55:22.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s a sort of primordial fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.210" end="00:55:25.369" style="s2">primordial anger and hatred I imagine as</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.670" end="00:55:27.349" style="s2">well so would be really cool having a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.369" end="00:55:29.150" style="s2">motion gym where you do that build a</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.349" end="00:55:31.970" style="s2">relationship with it and be friends with</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.150" end="00:55:35.720" style="s2">it and see what may be a thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.970" end="00:55:38.030" style="s2">emerged when they come up emotional</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.720" end="00:55:40.490" style="s2">affective patterns I&#39;ll write it in in</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.030" end="00:55:42.109" style="s2">the chat box in the moment but we should</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.490" end="00:55:44.060" style="s2">close out I&#39;m just want to open up the</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.880" end="00:56:18.800" style="s2">like I call it like gonzo anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.970" end="00:56:21.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re doing anthropology but</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.800" end="00:56:23.030" style="s2">you&#39;re like putting the like putting and</p>

<p begin="00:56:27.859" end="00:56:32.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve been suffering from Twitter brain</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.510" end="00:56:36.230" style="s2">just from like seeing what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.170" end="00:56:38.030" style="s2">just and like besides a shortened</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.230" end="00:56:39.589" style="s2">attention there&#39;s like I&#39;ve been all</p>

<p begin="00:56:39.589" end="00:56:45.349" style="s2">play come at play and I&#39;m still like</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.500" end="00:56:47.869" style="s2">trying to put them into words but if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.349" end="00:56:49.910" style="s2">have the wherewithal to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.869" end="00:56:53.380" style="s2">experiment with different news sources</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.910" end="00:56:55.310" style="s2">and all that that suggests you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.380" end="00:56:58.040" style="s2">trying to immerse yourself in different</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.310" end="00:57:02.330" style="s2">these different millou&#39;s and mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.040" end="00:57:04.250" style="s2">tribes I just put some in a chat box</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.330" end="00:57:05.810" style="s2">loop near ours off and I had an exchange</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.250" end="00:57:08.540" style="s2">of a pair of politics conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.810" end="00:57:10.940" style="s2">theories and Robert Anton Wilson called</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.540" end="00:57:13.010" style="s2">it guerrilla ontology which is a similar</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.940" end="00:57:14.570" style="s2">to that gonzo anthropology that you were</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.010" end="00:57:17.930" style="s2">talking about and that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.570" end="00:57:20.359" style="s2">really method acting a reality tunnel so</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.930" end="00:57:22.160" style="s2">that being said let&#39;s close out I just</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.359" end="00:57:23.420" style="s2">maybe hand it over to Jason and Jared if</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.160" end="00:57:26.930" style="s2">you guys have any final thoughts before</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.420" end="00:57:29.869" style="s2">we say goodbye I guess my only final</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.930" end="00:57:33.320" style="s2">thought is if folks are interested we do</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.869" end="00:57:36.470" style="s2">have a slack group a medic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.320" end="00:57:38.210" style="s2">slack group where you know it gets</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.470" end="00:57:39.710" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s more active sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.210" end="00:57:42.589" style="s2">it&#39;s less active you know people get</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.710" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">busy but you know we kind of discussed</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.589" end="00:57:47.390" style="s2">various topics and strategies for</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:50.510" style="s2">mediation but also you know sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.390" end="00:57:52.369" style="s2">we have our own little inside Wars I</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.510" end="00:57:53.869" style="s2">guess you could say which are always fun</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.369" end="00:57:56.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s a good kind of little training</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.869" end="00:57:58.310" style="s2">ground so if people are just and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.780" end="00:58:00.940" style="s2">may be Peter I don&#39;t know if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.310" end="00:58:03.109" style="s2">put the link in the chat box as well</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.940" end="00:58:04.130" style="s2">and so you know so it&#39;s a way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.109" end="00:58:06.290" style="s2">keep the conversation going</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.130" end="00:58:09.080" style="s2">well you know I think obviously video is</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.290" end="00:58:12.080" style="s2">a better format like I vastly prefer</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.080" end="00:58:14.180" style="s2">this than than chatting but that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.080" end="00:58:14.940" style="s2">kind of a might be an in-between you</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.180" end="00:58:23.579" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.940" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">Brij oh yeah I have so many there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.579" end="00:58:27.089" style="s2">many directions I that were coming up as</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:29.609" style="s2">we were talking that I could have gone</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.089" end="00:58:32.339" style="s2">down so I&#39;m just wrapping fire say a</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.609" end="00:58:37.079" style="s2">couple and Kyra you&#39;re kind of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.339" end="00:58:38.339" style="s2">dojo and and Peter you&#39;re the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.079" end="00:58:39.839" style="s2">affective patterns and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.339" end="00:58:42.450" style="s2">this sounds like it&#39;s a kind of personal</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.839" end="00:58:44.760" style="s2">way of doing trigger practice emotional</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.450" end="00:58:46.859" style="s2">trigger practice but I really you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.760" end="00:58:51.539" style="s2">to speak to some of this method acting</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.859" end="00:58:52.950" style="s2">or performative agnostic role or you</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.539" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">know just embodying certain perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.950" end="00:58:59.069" style="s2">I really love the idea cara of having of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.640" end="00:59:01.980" style="s2">setting up a certain social situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.069" end="00:59:04.380" style="s2">where both people are put into a certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.980" end="00:59:06.359" style="s2">character and possibly even a character</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.380" end="00:59:08.670" style="s2">that has a stance that that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.359" end="00:59:10.589" style="s2">even agree with but are in opposition to</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.670" end="00:59:13.440" style="s2">each other and the goal of it is to like</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.589" end="00:59:15.780" style="s2">get each other really angry or mad and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.440" end="00:59:18.170" style="s2">just kind of push boundaries but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.780" end="00:59:20.520" style="s2">no personal identification to the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.170" end="00:59:23.430" style="s2">ideology ideological content that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.520" end="00:59:25.140" style="s2">the thing but your body doesn&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.430" end="00:59:26.339" style="s2">difference I think if specially the more</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.140" end="00:59:28.099" style="s2">you get into it</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.339" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">so yeah this kind of relational</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.099" end="00:59:33.329" style="s2">emotional affective patterning seems</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">very rich and yeah I&#39;d be I&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.329" end="00:59:39.420" style="s2">fascinated if you&#39;re into exploring that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:42.750" style="s2">more I think that&#39;d be really fun so</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.420" end="00:59:44.369" style="s2">feel free to reach out to my cell phone</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.750" end="00:59:47.160" style="s2">on Twitter or something and anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.369" end="00:59:49.200" style="s2">that I think so</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.160" end="00:59:53.220" style="s2">I&#39;m also on the mimetic mediation slack</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.200" end="00:59:55.440" style="s2">channel but yeah this was this was fun I</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.220" end="00:59:56.970" style="s2">think it was kind of like a we started</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.440" end="00:59:59.099" style="s2">out with a very shotgun approach just</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.970" end="01:00:00.539" style="s2">kind of like everybody just airing what</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.099" end="01:00:01.740" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking about and they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.539" end="01:00:04.020" style="s2">felt disjointed but then I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.740" end="01:00:06.539" style="s2">seemed to to pull together at the end</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.020" end="01:00:08.910" style="s2">and we found a thread so this was super</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.539" end="01:00:11.220" style="s2">fun and and excited to see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.910" end="01:00:13.230" style="s2">next week yeah I agree that was a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.220" end="01:00:14.940" style="s2">good stuff enriched rheya do you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.230" end="01:00:22.140" style="s2">briefly talk about your oxytocin party</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.940" end="01:00:23.849" style="s2">later flame essentially I&#39;m offering</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.140" end="01:00:26.700" style="s2">tonight is a series of embodied</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.849" end="01:00:28.350" style="s2">relational experiences to help support</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.700" end="01:00:30.620" style="s2">this dance of</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.350" end="01:00:33.600" style="s2">the medic tribe and an embodied tribe</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.620" end="01:00:35.820" style="s2">and to really like so tonight&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.600" end="01:00:39.180" style="s2">more fun light-hearted but in hopes to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.820" end="01:00:41.940" style="s2">really create and cultivate this a safe</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.180" end="01:00:43.950" style="s2">space to not play it safe so the more</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.940" end="01:00:45.390" style="s2">that we can cultivate trust and empathy</p>
