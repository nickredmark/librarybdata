<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">thank you appreciate that yes indeed</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">next question from episode 41 do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">think that abiogenesis may be an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">and that new life forms may appear near</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">deep ocean vents for example without us</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">noticing</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">well if they did come into existence at</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">deep ocean vents i would not notice</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">i just don&#39;t get there very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">well here&#39;s the thing so uh give me a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">little leash here this is um</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">worth understanding the fact is there</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">a great many different dna codes you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">could have</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">so you can imagine a great many</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">different mappings</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">of three letter codons to the particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">amino acids that they encode</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">so even if you had the accidental</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">creation of a novel tree of life that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">used dna</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">right even if you just happened to land</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">on the dna formulation you would still</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">expect a different mapping</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">between the amino acids in the proteins</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">and the dna</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">code the fact that everything on earth</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">that uses dna so prions would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">excluded from this</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">well primes are excluded in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">that they reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">patterns without going through a dna</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">phase but</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">nevermind primes for a second that all</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">the plants animals fungi and other</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">living creatures that we see</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">use the same dna code tells us</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">that they emerge from the same tree of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">life if we found</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">a version of life that used either a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">molecule to transmit information or</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">contained a different encoding</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">then we would have reason to suspect a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">new tree of life so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.120" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">this is all to say we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:10.639" style="s2">multiple trees darwin didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have multiple trees in fact in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">the origin of species he leaves open the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">possibility that there are more than one</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">tree</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">we now know better because we have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">molecular techniques to identify</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">that at least all living creatures seem</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">to derive from one</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">ancestor but if it did happen a they</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">would probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">blink out of existence very quickly we</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that has happened but</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t see evidence of it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">if they didn&#39;t blink out of existence</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">and they began to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">evolve we would be able to detect that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">they were discontinuous from the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">um because it would be very striking</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">that they did not use the same encodings</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">so i&#39;m just i&#39;m going to take issue with</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">one thing and what you said which is i</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">imagine why we would expect that a new</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">form of life would have happened upon</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">dna</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">this is i mean this strikes me as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">least probable part of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">and you know once you&#39;ve happened upon</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">dna independently like</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">staggeringly stagnantly unlikely um sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">it might use</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">different uh different codes from there</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">on but you know this</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">this is a this is a theme of course that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">you know that i explored in the science</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">fiction that i was writing</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">a couple years ago that has been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">back burned for the moment but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">um other evolutions of life in even</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">within our galaxy seems actually very</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">very likely</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">um but we will know that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">different origin by the fact that it has</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">a different what i came to start calling</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">an infomall an information molecule</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">and you know why why would we start with</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">the premise that you know even if it had</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">the same dna it would have a different</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">code like just</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">just begin with if it&#39;s really a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">origin of life it&#39;s almost certain to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">um to have some different molecule whose</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">business is transmitting information</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">well i&#39;m going to take issue with your</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">taking issue with my statement because</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">all i was saying is</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">even in the unlikely event that dna was</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">the core molecule which would</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">hide the fact of it being a separate</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">evolution we would still readily detect</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:02.879" style="s2">it so i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s likely at all</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">i&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.879" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">even in the event that we are dealt the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">unlucky</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">um confusing fact of a dna based life</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">form that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">from the same tree we would still be</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">able to see it easily yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">for for those watching uh i will just</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:22.879" style="s2">point out that i have managed to con</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">uh two our two younger cats fairfax and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">moxie now on the scene</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">force of good or evil</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">do snakes and humans have an</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">evolutionary history or link</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">so they there is no phylogenetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">uh common ancestor between snakes that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t the same common ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">uh that all mammals have with all</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">reptiles that is to say we do of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">have the most recent coming associated</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">with snakes as we do with every single</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">life form on the planet and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">keeping with that last question</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">there was only one evolution of life on</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">the planet that stuck we know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">because we have this one information</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">molecule that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">in which life is coated the same way um</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">exceptions being viruses um there seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">to be multiple evolutions</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">of um of viral code</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">you have said yeah i don&#39;t that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">what i mean to imply i believe that all</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">viruses that we know of derived from</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">that tree of life</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:29.519" style="s2">most likely way is that they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">genomic escapees from some creature but</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">they are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">evolved independently okay that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">thought you had said</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">way back when we were first doing this</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">which took me very surprising okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">have we have just the one</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">the one tree um and so you know we&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">more closely related to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">snakes um than a kangaroo is for</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:54.000" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">um but the fact that many snakes</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.000" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">although by no means all um are actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">capable of posing a remarkable threat to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">humans means that any rule that suggests</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">that you should be wary of snakes</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">is likely to be a powerful one and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">persist in cultures</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">so we could say a lot more about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">maybe you want to add just a well i just</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">add that that snakes are very</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">widespread there in fact the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">specious</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">clade of legless lizards that exists</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">yeah and the most dangerous all of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">other times that lizards have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2">leglessness and it has happened several</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">those legless lizards mostly keep to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">themselves and when i say they mostly</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">keep to themselves they actually do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">they do not suddenly emerge well armed</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">men shoot people true yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">yes i&#39;m hoping that a certain number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">people are sitting at home</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">wondering if they really heard us just</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">claim that snakes were lizards which we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">yeah and that uh lizards lost their legs</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">more than once</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">and only snakes really well they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">ran with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">that&#39;s an odd way to put that yes if</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">you&#39;re curious about how snakes could</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">be lizards and what that means i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">an essay years ago which you can find</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">under the heading um on being a fish</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">and so in some of your fish free time</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">you can read that essay and discover</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">um about seals being bears and the like</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">seals being bears and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">one more thing about snakes and really</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">you know don&#39;t don&#39;t get me started i</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">could spend</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">many hours talking about snakes um and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.519" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">in the past to get paid for it i used to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">get paid to talk about snakes among</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">um bowids which is a uh a group of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">snakes that includes of course the boas</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">and is a fairly basal group that is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">say um</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">it that family hasn&#39;t changed as much</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">since</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">all of the rest of the snakes have</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">changed a lot as as the other ones have</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">um actually in their early development</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">um a little pelvis and little tiny hind</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">limbs</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">and those things mostly or entirely</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">disappear</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">as uh when they&#39;re adults but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:05.519" style="s2">actually see that happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">uh developing and then disappearing yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.519" end="00:12:09.839" style="s2">yes yes yes they never you never see</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">posts with little tiny legs right</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.839" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">on the outside but if you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">if you dissect them</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">you can see a little pelvis and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">femurs i think they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">um the tibia and um</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">um fibula yeah yeah boweds which are</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">very popular in the pet trade</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">they&#39;re staggeringly popular if i had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">boat we&#39;d we don&#39;t keep snakes but if i</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">had a boat i would name it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">david poet you would i would yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">and i would appreciate that okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">are ancient fairy tales and myths about</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">monsters really warnings to kids about</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">serial killers and child molesters</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">um well they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">certainly well ancient ones are</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">certainly warnings about</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">something and how they work we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">know we could speculate and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">might be warnings about particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">dangerous details of the world i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">eric</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">i think it&#39;s this point originally um</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">makes a point about</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">evil step parent</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">mythology which actually turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">a warning about</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">evil step parents you don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">right i do how did he get there that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">seems like quite a leap well i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">think the point is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">evolutionarily there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">reason for this pattern right</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">somebody if step parents being more</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">likely to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">cause harm to children than than genetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">right and you could imagine a woman</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">steps into a man&#39;s life he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">kids she has no genetic interest in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">those kids</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">so um in order to curry favor with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:49.279" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">she would have to play nice with those</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.279" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">kids but of course when he wasn&#39;t around</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">a different side of her might emerge</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">sure so the wicked stepmother is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">a resonant trope because there will have</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">been many wicked stepmothers in history</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">which is not to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">that step parents are inherently bad in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">fact human beings</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">routinely adopt other they adopt</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">now historically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">adoption would have existed and it would</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">in general have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">babies or children who were related</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">but the ability to adopt uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">offspring that are not yours and treat</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">them very well exists but the chances of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">a parent being a bad parent go</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">up if the child is not related i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">would point out that even our</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">keeping of pets is effectively our</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">ability to feel love for</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">and to take care of a creature that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">really not closely related to us at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">so that capacity exists but it fails</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">more often when children</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">are not related and the step parent</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">situation given the long lives of human</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">and the likelihood that one partner dies</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">the chances that a child will encounter</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">a wicked step parent is fairly high</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">and stories that warn of that phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">uh you know give them a little bit of uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t say an advantage but reduce</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">the disadvantage of the situation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">find themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">yeah i guess i would just add uh with</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">regard to ancient fairy tales and myths</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">being monster</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">about monsters really warning kids about</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.199" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">serial killers and child molesters</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">of course there are also going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">distinct</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">non-human monstrous threats in each of</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.839" style="s2">in which such fairy tales exist and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">you would expect the monsters</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">to resemble something that is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">possibility in the individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">environments uh where</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">the particular fairy tales emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">which brings us to komodo dragons</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">yes it does what do you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">about coming to dragons nothing i just</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">you just want to talk about if you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">talking you&#39;re just you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">playing my role okay yeah you&#39;re exactly</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.759" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">all the time well somebody&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">okay the next question before we get</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">into questions uh from the last hour</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">episode 42 is from the discord channel</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">um i told i said that we would answer a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">question from discord once a week</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">that they had voted on that they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">answered and here it is what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.199" style="s2">perceive</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">to be the downstream consequences of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.199" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">destigmatization of sex work</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">particularly in young women so this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">this warrants this warrants so much and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">i will begin</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">um by saying uh that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">this not exactly about sex work but that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve got an essay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">that should be published within a few</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">days at this point it&#39;s not yet out on</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">the evolution of sex and the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">of love and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">on um what i&#39;m calling a kind of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">autism</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">which can be produced by um by</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:44.560" style="s2">basically being an avid watcher of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">pornography</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">so pornography and sex work are</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">not exactly not entirely overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">but this movement that calls itself sex</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">positive</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">which basically says you know any sex at</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">any time</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">is inherently good and sex work is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">inherently good and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">remove all stigma associated with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">has clearly been named</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">in the same vein as many of these modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">such that if you resist it it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">seem like a prude what are you not sex</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">positive are you sex negative do you not</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">like sex</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">well no so i would say and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">argument that we have we have both made</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">um that the so-called sex positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">movement is actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">an anti-love anti-connection and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">really in a lot of ways an anti-sex</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">movement because it it does</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">move women um especially you know young</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">into a mode uh that is more like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">one of one of the less honorable typical</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">male modes</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">rather than uh sort of being interested</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">in a society</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">and moving um men and women both</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">into a mode that is more like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">ancestral female mode with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">interest in long-term bond and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">commitment and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">healthy and wonderful and surprising</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">yeah i would just say uh in addition</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">that the sex drive</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">is among the most powerful motivators in</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">the human</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">arsenal and that the rendering</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">of many readily accessible ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">to scratch that itch is</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">having totally arbitrary effects on</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">society it affects the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">families form it affects whether people</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">getting the right kind of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">stimulation to feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">healthy it affects whether people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">accomplishing important things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">require</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">you know striving and risk-taking and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">all of these things and basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">you know because sex is fun</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">people want easy access to it but easy</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">access to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">is interfacing with what human beings</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">in a very negative way and it is uh i</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:04.720" style="s2">would think</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">is spectacularly disempowering of women</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.720" end="00:19:09.919" style="s2">that women effectively end up</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">competing with uh things that provide</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.919" end="00:19:12.960" style="s2">satisfaction that don&#39;t involve any</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">commitment at all like</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.960" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">prostitution and like porn and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">things like this and so basically it um</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">it is rendering the meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">much less meaningful and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard thing to say because as</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">you&#39;re immediately understood to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">prude if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:37.120" style="s2">um if you oppose this and i would just</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.120" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">the the proper way to think about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">involves thinking about tantric sex</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">which is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">not prudish or uh sex</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">negative if that&#39;s even a thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">obviously extremely sex positive but</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.480" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">what it is about is about</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">managing sexual desire in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">heightens sexual pleasure rather than</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">oh if sexual pleasure is good then more</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">and easier and you know less</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">less meaningful so um you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">sex positivity needs to be reinvented as</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">a one word answer to this question you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">used it in that so the question again</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">just to wrap up</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">what do you perceive to be the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">downstream consequences of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">and and therefore really ultimately of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">okay next question thoughts on longevity</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">and or immortality</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">is death useful in the sense that it may</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">push a sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">if given the option would you live</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:57.679" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">god no that&#39;s a lot of questions yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.679" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">so this is a tough one and nobody ever</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.960" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">likes my answer on this which is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">evolution solved this problem long long</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">ago and the fact that you don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">answer doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t the best</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">answer going</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">right what evolution has done is it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:17.360" style="s2">solved all of the problems that block us</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.360" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">immortality or indefinite longevity</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">which is probably the better way to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">it has solved them by allowing you to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">take the part of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">that matters and to upload it to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">next generation</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">minus the part that&#39;s no longer relevant</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">we do this and we do it through the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">production of offspring and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">offspring</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">take a tremendous amount from us at a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">cognitive and emotional level that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">a large part of the meaning of childhood</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">is the conveying of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">important concepts skills everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">else to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.559" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">creatures that matter because preserving</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">your body indefinitely</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">a it ain&#39;t gonna happen and b it</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be a good solution because for</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">one thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">what is it that you think you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">that&#39;s so all fired important that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">need to keep your version of it around</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">right you want to keep seeing things we</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">get that right we are all</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">wired to want to continue to live and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">the idea that death is frightening and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">makes you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">look for alternatives to it is natural</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:25.840" style="s2">but but the fact is first of all if</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve fixed the body so it could live</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.840" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">you won&#39;t have fixed the brain which</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">creates an obvious computing problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">right even if you get past the cellular</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">level problems the brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">is built to remember a certain number of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">things and forget most</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">things and it&#39;s built to do so over a</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">span of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">80 maybe 100 years we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">mechanism for figuring out how to forget</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">enough stuff that you could live 500</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">without creating a problem right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">brains are going to fail</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">even if we cured the body the brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">would fail for its own</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">informational reasons if you could cure</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">the brain what would life look like when</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">you were young you&#39;d be forgetting so</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">much stuff in order to leave</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">room to remember that rare thing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">actually was going to matter in a life</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">of 500 or 1000 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">that you&#39;d be unrecognizable as a person</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:16.400" style="s2">and i think the fact that anybody thinks</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:19.280" style="s2">that this is workable</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.400" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">is a measure of their wishful thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.280" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">more than it is a measure of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">tractability of the problem it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">tractable</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">and what do you know we already have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">solution and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">embrace it because it is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">your death is coming that gives</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">life meaning and makes it precious so</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">you know treat it as precious</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">and at the moment you think we really</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">have to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">look at how most people live right is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">there something</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">eternal about what they&#39;re doing are</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">they spending their time in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">makes you think oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">actually every moment of human life is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">precious and we should you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">no people squander life so um</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i think we just all need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:59.039" style="s2">grow up and get over this fantasy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:02.559" style="s2">realize life is precious and it ends</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">and um the the way to make that less</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.559" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">tragic</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:07.440" style="s2">is to pass on things that matter to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:07.440" style="s2">children</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">lower rates of adhd and asperger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">than do um sort of general population in</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">the us at large</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">if that&#39;s true and that sounds likely to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">be true to me but i don&#39;t know it to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">um to what might we ascribe this</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">and so the two so putting aside the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">hidden curriculum question here</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:54.559" style="s2">uh the two possible explanations that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:57.039" style="s2">this questioner</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.559" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">suggests is pharmaceuticals the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.039" end="00:26:01.679" style="s2">over-medication epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">and um basically over-scheduling i guess</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.679" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">i would say with regarding</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">uh letting children be free-range and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">you know i think i think that 100 both</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">of these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">have to do with failures and development</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">that mainstream american children are</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">at terrifying rates that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">being allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">take risks and live and explore and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">actually make mistakes for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">either actually i wish to say let them</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">be free range</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">don&#39;t make them have lessons you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">every single moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">of every single day and this is of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">course speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">absent the coveted lockdowns and virtual</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">schools and such which changes</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">everything but then also do not drug</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">them into submission</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">you know some some people need some</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">mood disrupting or enhancing drugs in</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">order to live</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">full and normal lives we should always</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">think very very carefully before we give</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">and we should also think very very</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">carefully about what that&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">for development when it&#39;s something as</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">powerful as for instance</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">speed or an ssri</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">i would add that what we can say</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">almost for sure is that adhd</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">to the extent it exists and aspergers</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">sure to be at least in part responses to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">novel phenomena and those novel</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">phenomena can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">pharmaceutical in nature but they can</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">also be</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:32.840" style="s2">something like screens and in fact there</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">was a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">study 10 years ago or so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">that actually advanced to the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">that autism was being caused by</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">screen time on the basis that it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:49.279" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">correlate with bad weather the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.279" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">implication being children were indoors</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">and exposed to televisions the idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">underlying the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">was that by</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">you&#39;re placed in front of a screen in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">way that uh no ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">would have been you see a person there</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">they might be a face distance apart and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">they are emoting and talking but they</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">don&#39;t respond to you and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">in some people this would break the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">developmental process that would cause</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">interaction between two people who were</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">face to face</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">from developing properly so is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:27.279" style="s2">i don&#39;t know but it&#39;s plausible and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">this will change now that screens are</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.279" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">interactive right television was a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">passive</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">environment for somebody to sit in front</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">of now these screens involve</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">some kind of exchange of information you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">may be typing</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">you know um but anyway these things will</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">change over time but the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">aspect is the novelty of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">you are built to develop</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">properly in an environment that looks</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">like your ancestors environment</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">and the farther your environment looks</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">from that or worse the faster it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">the more likely you are to disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:03.520" style="s2">development and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">create uh you know dental problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.520" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">eye problems emotional problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">expect a culture like the amish or like</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">mennonites</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:15.600" style="s2">who reject many of the hyper-novel</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">aspects of our modern culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.600" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">to of course show fewer</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">hyper-modern diseases and pathologies as</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">well yeah of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">totally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">polygenic and multifaceted though it may</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">could you please elaborate on why</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">cognitive capacity should not be</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">disparate across subpopulations due to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">genetic factors</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">i&#39;m generally curious please disregard</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">if necessary</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">related to my last comment satoshi</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">kanasawa has</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">written a fairly persuasive argument</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">vis-a-vis differential selective</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">again please disregard if this is risky</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know kind of saw why do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:55.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">no um we&#39;re going to get tangled over</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.760" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">this again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">probably it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">requires a longer explanation somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">but the question isn&#39;t are there going</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:07.600" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">differences in cognition based on</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.600" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">differences in local environments</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">there will be will those be manifest</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">in genetic that is to say heritable in</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">the narrow scientific sense of that term</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">will they be manifest there or will they</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:25.520" style="s2">be transmitted in a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">way which is to say if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">grow up in the arctic your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">will be adjusted to the arctic but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">will be transmitted to you in large</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">measure culturally</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">right so the question is do we expect a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:40.799" style="s2">residual</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">in the genetically programmed and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.799" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">hardwired</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">layer or do we expect the differences to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">be passed on</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.919" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">uh culturally and through learning and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">in which case they&#39;re entirely</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">democratizable they&#39;re democratizable</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">exactly and so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">could there be differences in</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">the hardwired capacity of brains yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">there can be differences between</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">populations in fact here&#39;s the bitter</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">pill</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">there have to have been those</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">differences that&#39;s how we got big brains</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">different populations had different</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">levels of uh capacity based on how much</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">brain they had and those with more</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">capacity outcompeted those with less</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">so there&#39;s that except neanderthals</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">right well we don&#39;t exactly know what</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">went on with neanderthals but</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">for another day but the point is yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">those differences can exist</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">yes they must have existed but in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">modern human population</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">where we are all one species is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">likely that populations have inherited</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">substantially different</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">capacity differences no i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">so will they have inherited</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">some yeah it&#39;s be very unusual if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">answer was</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">exactly zero but the a i wouldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">which populations to bet on</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">and b the question is are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">differences between populations in terms</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">of their capacity relative to our shared</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">are those differences likely to be large</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">relative to the part that is transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">culturally</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">or small and my bet is almost</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">unmeasurable</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">that would be my bet</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">um please make unity long-term</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">i need a we need a manifesto of</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">yeah and we might also actually come</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">this question of whether or not we think</p>

<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">itself strangely polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">i have i&#39;ve begun to see a number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">people basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">making making the argument that because</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">uh not fully understood in terms</p>

<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">um that it should not be legalized and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">it sounds very much like prohibition to</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">me and i you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:49.519" style="s2">where i fall</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">um but i am just recently becoming aware</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">sort of which i i didn&#39;t ever predict</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">you know we</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">for years were just um like never</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">thought we&#39;d live to see the day</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">uh when it would be um common and legal</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">and fine</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">and frankly it seems like such a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.240" style="s2">deal than alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">in so many regards um but there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.240" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">there are those who oppose it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting to me i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">know much about that movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">but on on the basis that uh we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">its effects i must say i&#39;m far</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">more worried about television and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">facebook than i am yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">of the far i mean if even if we just</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">stick to you know exogenous chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">encouraging people or allowing people to</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">something a substance with which humans</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">um tens probably hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">of years of history</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">and some ability you know i know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">hundreds of thousands is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">considerably more than but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">at least 10.</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s going to be thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">years of history for sure but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">is you can also</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.640" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">uh modulate it you can yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">the effects are ones that you are aware</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">of in large measure and you can decide</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">whether they are positive or negative</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">where whereas the uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">fact of television and facebook makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">think like a corporation right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">hazard right there and you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">detect you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">right and so um i would just say</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">uh you know will there be negative</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">effects of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:33.040" style="s2">people uh using marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">yes but we have so many of these</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">cognitively disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">forces that cause you to do self-harm</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:40.400" style="s2">that something that has arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">effects is not the place to spend your</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">worrying and actually i think that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.640" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">think actually if i were to point to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">big risk of marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.560" end="00:35:53.119" style="s2">it&#39;s that market forces drove farmers to</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">create selective forces on the marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.119" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">itself to increase the thc</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">content so high and simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">decrease the cbd</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">content such that you have uh much more</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">basically much more ability to let um a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">small amount get you high</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:08.800" style="s2">but the thc tends to come with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">psychotic effects</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.800" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">and the cbd would tend to as far as i</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">understand it along with some other</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">active molecules we don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">named yet for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:20.480" style="s2">um mitigating effects of the wait don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">step on the trackpad kitkat</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">um some of the other bioactive molecules</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">in marijuana seem to in its</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">effects of the thc and now we have such</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually much more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">than it was back when</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">uh you know back when it was becoming</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">something that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:47.680" style="s2">you know increasingly widespread um</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">among young people</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.680" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">well interestingly it&#39;s not really even</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">market forces i would say that did that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">it was the way we</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">punish right because yeah it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">criminal</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">it was the law it was the law you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">punished on the basis of the weight</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.920" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">and so but i mean it was also about</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">crossing borders right it was i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:07.599" style="s2">the same thing um so the point is well</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.599" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">detection exactly but the you were</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">avoiding the law</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">you made it stronger so that less weed</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.079" style="s2">had greater effect which meant that when</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">you were caught with it the weight that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">was recorded was lower and the chances</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">of it being found crossing a border is</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">lower so that&#39;s the law causing it to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">concentrated which has now turned it</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">into actually quite a powerful drug</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">where it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">not a powerful drug so back when it</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:34.839" style="s2">began to be demonized</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">it was pretty mild yeah and pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.839" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">manageable and so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">that far safer to sit around with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">bunch of friends smoking a spliff in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">50s then</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">sharing you know then each of you having</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">a six-pack right</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">yeah i mean you&#39;re less likely to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">into a fight less likely to crash your</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">car</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">all sorts of things so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">fact that a safe drug was rendered</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">dangerous by our treating it as if it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">was dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">and now it&#39;s something that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">worry about because actually the effects</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">are substantial that&#39;s an argument</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">against uh trying to regulate it rather</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">uh regulating it into oblivion which</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and makes it worse</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:15.839" style="s2">yeah okay i don&#39;t know what this one</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.839" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">do you know should i read it uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:26.560" style="s2">um i have no idea what that means so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a reference to to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.560" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">gator uh on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">character on twitter whom we know</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">well al quinn if you want to clarify uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">we will read it but not knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">this is about i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:44.800" style="s2">read this out loud okay what are your</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">thoughts on the social moral and ethical</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.800" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">implications of technology</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">such as crispr gene editing becoming</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">available and accessible to the masses</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">well as i&#39;ve said before i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">we have the rosetta stone we have the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">typewriter but we don&#39;t have the rosetta</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">stone in crispr</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">we will eventually have the rosetta</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">stone at which point it becomes a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">phenomenon and as the price point drops</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:09.359" style="s2">and it becomes accessible to more people</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.359" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">we&#39;re in danger but the number of things</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">where this is the case</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">um you know the relatively low price</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">point to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">composite viruses and imbue them with</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">dangerous characteristics is apparently</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">uh already a level where</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">you know something well below a state</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">level actor could deliver a huge blow</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">so dangerous we have to rethink how</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">we do all of these things the ability</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">for some</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.280" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">or it could intentionally be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;re going to run into this</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.359" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">technology after technology and at some</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">you know just as we decide with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">right to bear arms that the right to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">bear arms does not involve</p>

<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">weapon</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">right we have to decide what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">to do about the technologies that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.440" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">cannot afford</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s not an easy question</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s going to involve</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:21.359" style="s2">a new understanding of the legal limits</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.359" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">certain rights on the other hand all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">our well-being is depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">ability to figure out how to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">yes was there resistance to the initial</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">1970s real-life enactment of the turner</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">ward play that started evergreen&#39;s day</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">of absence ritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">uh yearly theatrical performance might</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:46.480" style="s2">have sufficed as a learning device</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think so so this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.480" end="00:40:49.760" style="s2">in reference to</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">the the day of absence and day of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.760" end="00:40:53.359" style="s2">presence ritual that began</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know when maybe in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:56.079" style="s2">something maybe it began it</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">began almost at the beginning oh did it</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">okay so the original play is</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">50s i think 60s 50 60s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">um and then this day of absence um</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">which was established to demonstrate the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">importance of black people in in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">original</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">play the town and on campus on campus</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">um then got reversed in 2017 to much</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">fanfare</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">um was there any resistance i you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve never heard of any resistance no i</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:29.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there was um and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">what a yearly theatrical performance</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.119" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">have sufficed</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know uh you know i suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">it might like if it was really just</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">that play year after year after year it</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">might have become</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">it might just have become too</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:42.960" style="s2">commonplace just you know just the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.960" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t notice your furniture until</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">something happens on it or you move it</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">around or something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">you need to actually move stuff no</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">matter how powerful and necessary it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">in your life</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.880" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">you need to change it up in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">reminded of its</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">power and utility so you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">even just a rotating cycle of you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">that and our town and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">just a number of other plays but</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">that were that were put on as part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">this kind of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">might have been um might have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">no i don&#39;t think that that was ever part</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">of the part of the scene</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">yep i agree and something to change it</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">up would probably be necessary but i i</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">agree i mean the whole purpose of a play</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:26.880" style="s2">is to teach</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">something or to reveal something by</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">um yeah dragging it into the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">so um next one my vote is that you draft</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">your cat for unity 2020.</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">um because presumably he&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">share his ass with the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">and that would make him a good candidate</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t i think he&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">up to the job actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">next one to what degree if any is unity</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">inspired by the roman office of console</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">is this an office that you would like to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">see integrated or resurrected into our</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know my roman history well</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:03.520" style="s2">enough to to speak to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">yeah uh you&#39;ve caught me off guard um</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">consciously deriving from it but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">need to look into it more to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">to know whether there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">revive there i i have heard it mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">in a couple of places though</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">okay uh what time are we at zach</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">38 okay we&#39;ll do uh three more here and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">then we&#39;ll skip to the next uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">next stream is there a tie-in with what</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">is going on now</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">and the dove and hawk uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">gtm game theory manifestation i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">know what gtm stands for here</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">where the dove mindset grew too large</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">and self-imposed segregation and now the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">pendulum has swung to the opposite side</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">with progressives</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to map it on to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see it i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">think what really happened is you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">a you have two parties that have taken</p>

<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">has resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">suffering and inequality and a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:20.079" style="s2">feeling of anxiousness over what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:22.480" style="s2">coming you know people have</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">learned that they are just sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.480" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">carried along planktonically rather than</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">the um the objective of policy in some</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s resulting in lots of incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">lashing out right it&#39;s resulting in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">lashing out at immigrants it&#39;s resulting</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">in the lashing out</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">at government it&#39;s resulting in um</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">lashing out</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">uh one race against another and</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">uh i basically think it&#39;s incoherence</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">that we are seeing rather than</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:56.240" style="s2">strategies that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2">locked in some kind of battle it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.240" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a loss of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">and coherence more than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">do you have thoughts on neanderthal</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">predation and raping of early humans</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">if true what would be the genetic legacy</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">and could it support brett&#39;s idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:14.240" style="s2">genes seeking self-replication at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">expense of other</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.240" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s not your that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">your idea no it&#39;s not my idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">um yeah of course it could leave a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">genetic legacy yeah legacy it could also</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">die out</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">but yeah i guess i would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">i think there&#39;s an awful lot that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">could learn if we had better information</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">about what had taken place</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">between those two sister taxa um</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:41.359" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think we do have good</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">information yet yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.359" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">uh final question from this live stream</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">before switching to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:49.040" style="s2">the next one i&#39;m from peru and in recent</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.520" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">years i&#39;ve noticed that many american</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.040" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">tourists come here to drink and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">and experience ayahuasca why is this</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">happening please</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a get wise quick scheme not the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">drinking so much</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">no um i mean i think it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">too different</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s the recreational people</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">coming who are drinking and oh hey of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">course i&#39;m going to go do ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">yeah at some level it has become</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">relatively inexpensive to do the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">traveling</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">people are very focused on what they can</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">report back to their social</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">groups of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">drinking is just sort of a constant mode</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">ayahuasca is something you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">definitely report back and people will</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">want to hear what you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">and um so it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">that a people who are in a position to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">produce ayahuasca have discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">they can</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">uh earn by allowing gringos to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">to partake and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:58.960" style="s2">um b that gringos are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">doing it because it you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.960" end="00:47:04.240" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">extreme ethos and ayahuasca is extreme</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.240" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">in this regard right there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">things that you can find short of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">but people don&#39;t necessarily get real</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">excited to hear about your mushroom trip</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:15.760" style="s2">they definitely want to hear about</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">ayahuasca and they aspire to do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.760" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">themselves because they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">telling a story somebody else wants to</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">listen to</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">and so anyway i think all of this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">bit tragic because i do</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">think especially if one attempts to meet</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">ayahuasca on its own ground</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:36.079" style="s2">right its own um spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">context and i say that guardedly right</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">but the point is those who have</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">have wielded ayahuasca for thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">have some insight into</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">what is to be derived and how to derive</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:52.960" style="s2">and it is not necessarily clear that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">can just simply</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">create that scenario for gringos in</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">peru but um the attempt is necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">basically you don&#39;t want you want the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">remote version</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">you don&#39;t want you know what would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">yeah i went to mexico but really what</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">you did is you know you went to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">uh you know there are those who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">serious about</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">these things and there are those who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">just finding a market opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">exploiting it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">it matters a great deal with</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">hallucinogens context matters</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">so much and in this case maybe even more</p>

<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">from twitter and facebook posts loved</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">a kind of balance that would avoid</p>

<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">and in many ways this has worked exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">as i hoped in fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">it has exceeded my expectations quite a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">bit one way in which i do not see</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:58.400" style="s2">balance so far is that democrats</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:50:59.440" style="s2">insist that this is going to spoil the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.400" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">election for</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">trump even though the evidence suggests</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">that if anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">to the extent that there is a slight</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">bias it draws more from trump supporters</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">than biden supporters so it would tend</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">to spoil it the other direction to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">very tiny</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">extent that there&#39;s any tendency of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">nature at all well the question claims</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:17.440" style="s2">that both</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">people from both sides are making this</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:21.520" style="s2">claim right i don&#39;t see the ones</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">coming from the right saying that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">right so it&#39;s possible that that has</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.960" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">something to do with the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">what you&#39;re seeing yeah but it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.960" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">because this this</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">looks like this question makes it sound</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">that exists on both sides i would expect</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">it to but i would expect it to also</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">if it exists on both sides this is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:43.359" style="s2">great idea and i would love to see it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">but i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.359" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">portray in any way or magnify the degree</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">to which</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">um the republicans seem less concerned</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">about this if they do</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">well more power to them but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">uh more power to those who are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">frightened by this particular boogeyman</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">which keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">locked in the monopoly you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">the thing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">one of the things that i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">excited about with regard to unity and i</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">don&#39;t remember the numbers and i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">they change</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">regularly and i don&#39;t know who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">generating them</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">um but the idea that a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">fraction</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">of the people who are voicing support</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">for unity are people who say that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">would not otherwise be voting</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">and to me that makes it seem like</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.920" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">a critique of it on the basis that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:31.760" style="s2">will spoil an election that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">between two parties is an inherently</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.760" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">criticism it is unpatriotic and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">anti-democratic in the extreme how</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:39.760" style="s2">dare you challenge anything that brings</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">disaffected voters</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.760" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">back into the process that is very much</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">the way the parties see things but no</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">rational decent person should see it</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">that way bringing back people back into</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">is part of how we reinvigorate it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">make it work in the interests of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">so i absolutely agree with you that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like 25</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">yeah i thought i thought i&#39;d seen even</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.440" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">in the 30s at one point</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">is there an evolutionary explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">phobias to lizards spiders snakes etc</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:12.559" style="s2">and if it is or used to be beneficial to</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">fear them why are some people deathly</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.559" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">afraid while others aren&#39;t too bothered</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">thanks for everything you do so this</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">question will have come in after we</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">answered that earlier question about</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">snakes and i think it it plays right</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">into it that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">basically most places where there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">snakes</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">some of those snakes are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:33.040" style="s2">poisonous and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.240" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">uh easier and safer to have in across</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:36.720" style="s2">the board phobia</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve been places where there were some</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">very very wrong beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:41.520" style="s2">about um you know for instance one place</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.520" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">spent a field season in uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">southeastern i can&#39;t remember some place</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">in costa rica</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">um suggested that boas</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">are baby cortalets or baby pit vipers</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">and so if you kill bows whenever you see</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">them you will decrease the population of</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.200" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">pit vipers and of course this is no</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">truth whatsoever and the boas there</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">don&#39;t grow big enough to cause any harm</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:08.000" style="s2">to you and you really should not be</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">killing them but people would hack off</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.000" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">it would hack up boas with machetes</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">whenever they</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">saw them and this is really really</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">but it did speak to this larger truth</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">that actually there</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">the pit vipers of which there were</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">several species could be deadly</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">and and they were dangerous and hacking</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">them up when you saw them although not</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:28.160" style="s2">something that i ever did</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">um did probably leave more people around</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.160" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">um if they manage their</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">you know the spaces around their houses</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">um i have this i have this silly thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">i say that i think just in my anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:43.040" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">um the people seem people who you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.040" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">live who grew up like we did</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:48.400" style="s2">you know without having to be forced to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:51.359" style="s2">regularly</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.400" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">worry about uh organisms like this</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.359" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">uh getting into our homes and causing</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">causing harm</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">um tend to have a phobia of either the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">things with very very few legs or a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">a lot of legs</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">um that a lot of us don&#39;t particularly</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">like spiders but are</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:08.319" style="s2">quite an emirate of snakes and vice</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">versa and i see no reason why this would</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.319" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">actually be true but i sort of enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:14.319" style="s2">recognizing this in people when</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:16.000" style="s2">uh when i see it yep i am of the camp</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.319" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">that fears things with odd numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">legs</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">on numbers of legs so after the cat has</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">bitten a leg off a spider then then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">a feared however they get there um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">i will say</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">i think the general answer here is one</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.119" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">magical things about the way our minds</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.480" style="s2">work and develop</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">is that we may have a prejudice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.480" end="00:55:36.559" style="s2">built in</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">like there may be an underlying</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">prejudice against snakes because</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:42.000" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know something about a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">snake um there&#39;s a danger that it will</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.000" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">be dangerous to you and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">a limited value of uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">you&#39;re encountering the snake and not</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:51.760" style="s2">worrying about it now of course if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">eat snakes that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.760" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">so basically you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">reschedule these things based on</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">where you are a general fear of snakes</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">in a place where there&#39;s no dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">snakes maybe snakes are a safe food</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">source and a place where</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">some snakes are dangerous but most</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t maybe you need to get really</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">focused on which snake you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">with and think about where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">putting your feet</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s every reason to have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">software be flexible</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:21.520" style="s2">and some basic prejudice against things</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">that are sometimes dangerous like</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.520" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">spiders for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.960" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">makes some sense it also makes sense for</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">you to be able to develop</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:32.240" style="s2">a fear of something that comes</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">to be frightening to you through</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">information right like something you</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t fear</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:38.079" style="s2">that you realize is more dangerous than</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">you think like</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.079" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">you know you and i almost got caught in</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">a flash flood uh when we were in costa</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">rica during</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">an early field season so i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">looked at rivers the same way</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">after that i you know i saw something</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">but you can imagine the software is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">flexible for every reason you would want</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">it to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:00.160" style="s2">and that means that you can get bad</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">stuff in the software and you can be</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.160" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">irrationally afraid of something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t really a hazard or as a hazard so</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:08.319" style="s2">rarely like you know airplane crashes is</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">hazard so rarely that</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:12.400" style="s2">any to whatever degree you are dissuaded</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:14.079" style="s2">from doing something because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.400" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">afraid of being in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.079" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">airliner crash you&#39;re making an error</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">so you know flexibility is good but it</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">leaves open the possibility of bad</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:25.839" style="s2">programming that&#39;s arbitrary and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:27.440" style="s2">not good yeah no absolutely and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.839" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">just one more thing here</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.440" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think any of these examples</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:33.280" style="s2">that are given in the question lizards</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">spiders and snakes of course as we said</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">earlier snakes</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:40.079" style="s2">are a type of legless lizard um</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">have the capacity to spread disease to</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.079" end="00:57:44.480" style="s2">us um</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t think any spiders can</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.480" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">but i&#39;ll spider correct me if you think</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">i&#39;m wrong but i think i can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">an example</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">um all spiders do have venom so all</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">spiders can envenomate but most of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.160" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">don&#39;t do so in any in any way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:59.040" style="s2">gonna cause anything but a small a</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:00.240" style="s2">slight irritation and of course most</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">spiders are small enough they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.240" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">hard-pressed to get anything into you</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">with regard to lizards though you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">that subset of lizards that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">snakes</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">um there&#39;s only one or two venomous</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">lizards at all so the idea of being</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">scared of lizards</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:16.799" style="s2">um in any way is actually is is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">surprising one to me here and i you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.799" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">i say that as just someone who&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:21.359" style="s2">fan of lizards</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">but it makes me wonder you know get sure</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.359" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">they can they have a bite and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to know how to handle them if</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">you want to handle them</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:31.599" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:32.960" style="s2">that other than the one or two species i</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">just can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s one or two</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.960" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:37.119" style="s2">actually venomous lizards non-snake</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.359" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">lizards um</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.119" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">if they&#39;re not actually potentially</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">vectoring any diseases</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they do so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">there&#39;s lizard malaria and there&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.599" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">malaria but i don&#39;t think like an</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:47.760" style="s2">anopheles mosquito that fights one can</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:49.760" style="s2">bite the other and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.760" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">and transmit lizard malaria to humans</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.760" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">yeah they can they can</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:54.799" style="s2">uh tear open your skin some of them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:56.319" style="s2">cause an infection but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.799" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">they&#39;re not vectoring disease</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.319" end="00:59:00.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think so so the lizard</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">one is actually the surprising one to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">on that list unless people are</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:05.920" style="s2">you know correctly intuiting the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">phylogenetic connection which i</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.920" end="00:59:10.319" style="s2">you know i doubt which is that um snakes</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:12.079" style="s2">are lizards and therefore just you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.319" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">be wary of all the squamates</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.079" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">yep yep have you seen eric&#39;s latest</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">tweets</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:20.319" style="s2">apparently he is in discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">jack dorsey about the unity twitter ban</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.319" end="00:59:24.000" style="s2">he says it has reached the highest</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">levels of twitter corp yeah i saw one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.000" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.319" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s hopeful yeah i can&#39;t say i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.440" style="s2">seen them all but uh i was</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">up to date at some point before our</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.440" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:34.799" style="s2">i was quite surprised to hear some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">the things that jack seems to think</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.799" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">uh unity has engaged in as i said</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">on our main live stream it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:43.119" style="s2">organization and so we&#39;re doing our best</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">to figure out whether there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.119" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">that we should know that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:53.200" style="s2">but i believe twitter has misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:55.680" style="s2">what took place and that it has</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.200" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">treated unity very badly and i i must</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">say that at some level</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.280" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">i do suspect that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:04.480" style="s2">political underlying that even if</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.359" end="01:00:04.480" style="s2">we&#39;re being told otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">so this regarding the our our search for</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:12.160" style="s2">the name of a category of book</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">that tends to be used as a sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.160" end="01:00:15.680" style="s2">weapon to shut down conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">i suggest you call the category of book</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.680" end="01:00:19.040" style="s2">oscar wilde&#39;s defense</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know why a book was written</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">it must have been written for a good</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:25.359" style="s2">so i think that last thing is said uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">with some with some irony</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:28.880" style="s2">and this of course is reference to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.880" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">chesterton&#39;s fence which we&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.880" end="01:00:32.559" style="s2">several times</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:34.400" style="s2">um it&#39;s of course too too wordy and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.559" end="01:00:36.160" style="s2">gives too much credibility gives gives</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.400" end="01:00:37.280" style="s2">too much to osterweil or whoever name is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.160" end="01:00:40.559" style="s2">pronounced who wrote this</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.280" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">insane um book defending looting but i</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.559" end="01:00:42.559" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">i like the thinking and i&#39;d like for us</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.559" end="01:00:46.400" style="s2">to find the category name</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.319" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m trying to parse exactly</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:49.520" style="s2">what&#39;s being argued here this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:51.040" style="s2">somebody who clearly agrees with us that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.520" end="01:00:53.280" style="s2">this book is preposterous</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.040" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">and is trying to name the category that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:58.559" style="s2">we were looking for a name for</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">yeah and so this</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.559" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">obviously functions the logic is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">inverse of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">chesterton&#39;s fence because the reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">that a book is written</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">is at least partially going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">because you can get paid to write it</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">you know if it&#39;s a book that somebody</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">thinks they can sell and at this moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">a book that defends looting</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">will sell because they&#39;re an awful lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:20.000" style="s2">of people who are looking for somebody</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:22.799" style="s2">to tell them</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">why this is okay now i think uh i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.799" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">have it here i think it actually came</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">in may so um so</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">i think i think this was not written in</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:35.359" style="s2">the last couple of months</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">um but it it speaks to a moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.359" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">uh that is years long although these</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">last few months are of course fever</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">pitch with regard to the moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">all right i may be wrong about that but</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.480" style="s2">i think i saw that as surprising if true</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.480" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">um religion is literally false</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">religious metaphorical truth becomes</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">outdated so becomes maladaptive</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">would it be a mind virus at this point</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:02:03.839" style="s2">given that memes replicate and persist</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.799" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">um no the category you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.839" end="01:02:08.720" style="s2">is vestigial and vestigial is a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">overused claim with respect</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.720" end="01:02:15.599" style="s2">to morphological stuff however</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">in this case the question is if</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.599" end="01:02:19.119" style="s2">religion is now maladaptive and i</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t argue that i would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.119" end="01:02:23.520" style="s2">major components of it may be and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:25.359" style="s2">it is net maladaptive</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.359" end="01:02:28.160" style="s2">elements of it that are closer to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">timeless that are more likely to still</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.160" end="01:02:31.119" style="s2">be paying</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">their freight they&#39;re going to be other</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.119" end="01:02:37.520" style="s2">elements which are counterproductive</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">but that to the extent it is maladaptive</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.520" end="01:02:42.000" style="s2">a population that doesn&#39;t believe those</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:42.559" style="s2">things will have an advantage and it</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.000" end="01:02:45.280" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.559" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">driven out through uh evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:47.839" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">so i&#39;m not saying that is or isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.839" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">but i&#39;m saying that would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">true in the case that it was not</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">maladaptive and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.480" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">that period of time in which it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">ebbing which i believe we are seeing</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:03:00.559" style="s2">that period of time</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">religiosity has been decreasing and we</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.559" end="01:03:04.480" style="s2">may be seeing people apply their</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">religious impulse to things</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.480" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">that are not religions but that ebbing</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">period would be the period of</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:14.319" style="s2">elimination of those beliefs by an</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">evolutionary force</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.319" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">over time but what remained would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:22.559" style="s2">vestigial if it was not paying its way</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:26.160" style="s2">okay uh apparently the articles</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.559" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">have just been unsuspended wow</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.160" end="01:03:30.880" style="s2">wild apparently so you should the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t following it&#39;s not replenished but</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.880" end="01:03:34.240" style="s2">it will take time and be fully</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:37.039" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.240" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">interesting so say it so apparently we</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.039" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">are being told by</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.960" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">not a small bird i mean if he was a bird</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:46.319" style="s2">at all he&#39;d be a very large bird</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:47.480" style="s2">um that the articles of unity account</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.319" end="01:03:50.799" style="s2">has just been</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.480" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">unsuspended so that&#39;s good news i wonder</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.799" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">what happened and will we ever know i</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">hope i hope we find out</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:03:58.640" style="s2">that would be great yep so just to get</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.640" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">my thinking that the book had been</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">published back in may what i had</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">remembered was actually that it</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">she claims it just came out on tuesday</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.760" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">of last week but she finished it in</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">april</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2">which is you know consistent with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">standard publication schedule</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:17.280" style="s2">and boy she really got lucky or she</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:20.400" style="s2">really helped build riots fast</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.280" end="01:04:21.280" style="s2">something um okay next question nope</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.400" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.280" end="01:04:27.200" style="s2">uh there we go next next question</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.880" end="01:04:28.000" style="s2">next comment i am not a democrat i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.200" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">a republican</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.000" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">i am not a robot i am seeking unity</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:36.480" style="s2">hell yeah but you didn&#39;t wait not a</p>

<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:45.839" style="s2">accused of but weren&#39;t the so the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">russians weren&#39;t just russian bots it</p>

<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:58.240" style="s2">of how terrible</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.520" end="01:05:00.400" style="s2">my impression of a russian accent is</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.240" end="01:05:01.200" style="s2">it&#39;s so bad i couldn&#39;t possibly be</p>

<p begin="01:05:01.200" end="01:05:04.240" style="s2">basically maybe you&#39;re just a bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:08.319" style="s2">russian</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.240" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">um i i would think even a bad russian</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.319" end="01:05:12.480" style="s2">i mean a bad russian if i&#39;m to believe</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.319" end="01:05:15.119" style="s2">the movies and cartoons that i&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.480" end="01:05:15.520" style="s2">bad russian would have a particularly</p>

<p begin="01:05:15.520" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">accent it would be readily detectable</p>

<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that i think i do if i</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">had a nickel for every wingback chair</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">i had reupholstered i</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2">think i was gonna say i bet you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.960" end="01:06:06.240" style="s2">like describe a wing</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">back chair no in fact all i&#39;m seeing is</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.240" end="01:06:09.200" style="s2">wingtip shoes which i&#39;m sure</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.480" end="01:06:16.079" style="s2">absolutely that i have done yeah we have</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">no idea</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.079" end="01:06:19.599" style="s2">no i&#39;m sure there&#39;s youtube videos for</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:22.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.599" end="01:06:22.559" style="s2">um probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:26.079" style="s2">google uh new york city crime statistics</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.200" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">by race</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.079" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">dot nypd graphs</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.400" end="01:06:37.039" style="s2">show oh show okay nypd graphs</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">show 90 to 98 all crime by black and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.039" end="01:06:41.200" style="s2">brown people</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:43.760" style="s2">does more crime create worse cops does</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.200" end="01:06:46.720" style="s2">less crime allow cops to be more calm</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.760" end="01:06:48.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t this the root of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.720" end="01:06:50.000" style="s2">first of all i wonder about those</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.000" end="01:06:53.520" style="s2">statistics yeah that seems</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.000" end="01:06:56.640" style="s2">that seems suspiciously way too high</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.520" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">but does more crime create worse cops</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.640" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">it certainly creates more stressed cops</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:01.599" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">does less crime allow cops to be more</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.599" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">calm for sure</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">so more crime if you fix the level of</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:11.200" style="s2">funding</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:12.319" style="s2">then more crime will create worse cops</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.200" end="01:07:14.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.319" end="01:07:16.799" style="s2">police brutality is basically a</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.720" end="01:07:19.039" style="s2">substitute for proper funding</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.799" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">right so what do you mean if you fix if</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.039" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">if we imagine</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.839" end="01:07:23.440" style="s2">if thought experiment wise if we fix the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">amount of funding so you&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.440" end="01:07:25.680" style="s2">about correcting you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">fixing in place</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.680" end="01:07:28.799" style="s2">right which which meaning of fix are you</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:30.559" style="s2">using that&#39;s that&#39;s a crazy thing you</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">just said given the normal meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.559" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">the word fix</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:34.720" style="s2">there are in fact three meanings of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">word oh this is going to be good one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.720" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">them is spelled</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">fix in place there is to fix as in</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:41.920" style="s2">repair</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.960" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">and then there is fixing your animals oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.920" end="01:07:45.599" style="s2">back to being a bad russian oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">oh no no i thought you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.599" end="01:07:51.039" style="s2">about fixing like an election sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">you fix your cat or your dog as in</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.039" end="01:07:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;ll fix them it&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">okay let&#39;s resume let&#39;s see we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.480" end="01:07:58.240" style="s2">answer any questions you don&#39;t mean if</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.240" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">correct uh police funding all hell is</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:03.039" style="s2">gonna break loose which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">which is what it sounded like you said</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.039" end="01:08:08.000" style="s2">if in our thought experiment if we</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:09.920" style="s2">hold resources constant yep right</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:11.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say we hold resources constant at</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.920" end="01:08:14.640" style="s2">about the level that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.760" end="01:08:15.760" style="s2">that policing matches the criminality so</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.640" end="01:08:16.400" style="s2">you&#39;re getting a good return on</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.760" end="01:08:18.080" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.400" end="01:08:19.199" style="s2">and then we drive up the criminality</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.080" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">yeah but you don&#39;t have any more</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.199" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">policing</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">then the point is police in order to</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:27.199" style="s2">keep crime down will end up behaving in</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:27.839" style="s2">a more aggressive fashion so that people</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:30.159" style="s2">will think</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.839" end="01:08:32.080" style="s2">twice about behaving criminally because</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.159" end="01:08:35.600" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to encounter the police</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.080" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">right so the and because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.600" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">encountering they&#39;re having to encounter</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.279" end="01:08:40.159" style="s2">they&#39;re having to</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">engage in more situations that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.159" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">and uh they are more likely to be a hair</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:46.719" style="s2">trigger as a result</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">so anyway i think that the upshot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.719" end="01:08:49.520" style="s2">this if we put aside those suspicious</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:53.199" style="s2">statistics</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.520" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">the upshot is if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.199" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">decrease funding of police you will</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:09:00.239" style="s2">increase police brutality that is to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:02.799" style="s2">bad policing</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.239" end="01:09:05.040" style="s2">and you will increase crime right those</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.799" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">two things are predictable outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.040" end="01:09:09.359" style="s2">of a decrease in police funding now it</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:10.640" style="s2">could be that you have wildly overfunded</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.359" end="01:09:11.520" style="s2">police and you don&#39;t see that effect</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.640" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">until you get</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.520" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">way lower but that&#39;s not where we are</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">because for one thing as you</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:18.000" style="s2">have pointed out a number of times</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:19.839" style="s2">police are being</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.000" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">used to do jobs that really aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.839" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">inherently about policing like to deal</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:27.040" style="s2">with the mentally ill</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:29.600" style="s2">so the fact is police are</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.040" end="01:09:30.640" style="s2">overburdened they may be improperly</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.600" end="01:09:32.159" style="s2">trained they may be</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.640" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">improperly armed but they are</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.159" end="01:09:35.279" style="s2">overburdened and reducing funding</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:38.239" style="s2">without doing anything</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">else is going to result in more crime</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.239" end="01:09:44.319" style="s2">and more brutality</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:46.839" style="s2">yes do you believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">that democrats downplaying riots was or</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.839" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.080" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">with the belief that it would hurt trump</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.279" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">um i believe that the rioters</p>

<p begin="01:14:25.360" end="01:14:27.760" style="s2">it lives at the seder table and i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:32.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.760" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">did you know yeah the fact is uh</p>

<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">sephardic jews but i will say ashkenazi</p>

<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:44.880" style="s2">have good-natured</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.640" end="01:14:46.000" style="s2">but pointed arguments with each other</p>

<p begin="01:14:46.000" end="01:14:50.719" style="s2">matters and the fact is i think it</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.040" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">creates a culture of holding each</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.719" end="01:14:53.120" style="s2">other&#39;s feet to the fire it creates a</p>

<p begin="01:14:59.280" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">way underneath you and that that has</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.679" end="01:15:06.239" style="s2">impact and</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:07.520" style="s2">frankly i think it&#39;s valuable i think it</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.239" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.520" end="01:15:11.120" style="s2">with having lived this diaspora which is</p>

<p begin="01:15:24.159" end="01:15:26.960" style="s2">and you know the seder table i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.520" end="01:15:30.480" style="s2">think actually</p>

<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:52.480" style="s2">sort of co-created</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:54.320" style="s2">a kind of seder table phenomenon in our</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:55.040" style="s2">classroom so that is actually what we</p>

<p begin="01:15:55.040" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s the opposite of the now</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.320" end="01:16:02.080" style="s2">common use of the term safe space we</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.800" end="01:16:04.320" style="s2">created spaces</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.080" end="01:16:05.280" style="s2">where we actually had respect and trust</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.320" end="01:16:08.000" style="s2">for one another</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.280" end="01:16:09.040" style="s2">our students and us and they knew that</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.000" end="01:16:10.960" style="s2">when we disagreed with them or</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.040" end="01:16:13.679" style="s2">criticized them that we were not making</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.960" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">um the personal accusation about them or</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.679" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">claiming that they were not worthy but</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:18.239" style="s2">perhaps their</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:19.840" style="s2">ideas weren&#39;t uh and we were willing to</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.239" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">get into it with them and this this</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.840" end="01:16:23.600" style="s2">created an</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:25.920" style="s2">actual it&#39;s like a a seder space</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.600" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s it is it is an</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.920" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">actual safe space</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">that creates anti-fragility rather than</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:35.199" style="s2">um rather than weaklings it is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:38.159" style="s2">socially</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.199" end="01:16:39.280" style="s2">safe space created amongst people who</p>

<p begin="01:16:39.280" end="01:16:44.400" style="s2">to handle it and it it creates the right</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:46.840" style="s2">incentive you know because if we</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.400" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">you know if we challenge the student&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.840" end="01:16:50.239" style="s2">argument and</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:52.000" style="s2">you know that&#39;s weak because if that</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.239" end="01:16:53.440" style="s2">were true it would predict these things</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.000" end="01:16:55.040" style="s2">which we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.440" end="01:16:56.960" style="s2">and then the student thinks about it and</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.040" end="01:16:59.199" style="s2">they say actually i think it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.960" end="01:17:00.080" style="s2">because x y or z and then you say yep</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.199" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">you got it right</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.080" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s compelling then the point</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:05.600" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">reinforces this sort of careful thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.600" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">and extrapolation</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:10.719" style="s2">behavior that is the stuff of uh nuanced</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.840" end="01:17:14.560" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.719" end="01:17:16.080" style="s2">yeah three more</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.560" end="01:17:17.440" style="s2">hi brett your perspective has been very</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.080" end="01:17:19.040" style="s2">insightful and influential on my</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.440" end="01:17:21.040" style="s2">thinking i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.040" end="01:17:22.880" style="s2">if you think that unity 2020 could lead</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.040" end="01:17:25.679" style="s2">the way to game b</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.880" end="01:17:26.400" style="s2">good question um i have been talking to</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.679" end="01:17:28.960" style="s2">people in</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.400" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">many different realms about the idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.960" end="01:17:32.080" style="s2">that these</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:33.040" style="s2">things are all manifestations of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.080" end="01:17:34.719" style="s2">same phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.040" end="01:17:36.719" style="s2">in different realms so i don&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.719" end="01:17:39.760" style="s2">just unity and game b</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.719" end="01:17:41.679" style="s2">i see unity as the i mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.760" end="01:17:43.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a political but in a political</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.679" end="01:17:44.719" style="s2">realm it is a manifestation of the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.679" end="01:17:48.000" style="s2">kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.719" end="01:17:52.159" style="s2">that game b is at a complex systems and</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.000" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">society level which is the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.159" end="01:17:58.560" style="s2">as idw is in discussion space</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">as open source movement is in</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.560" end="01:18:04.960" style="s2">the technological space as um</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:06.640" style="s2">uh blockchain and crypto is potentially</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.960" end="01:18:08.080" style="s2">to the financial space</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.640" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">all of these things are attempts to</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.080" end="01:18:13.280" style="s2">solve a systems level problem with a</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.880" end="01:18:17.520" style="s2">higher quality answer</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.280" end="01:18:20.640" style="s2">that is stable and competitively viable</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.520" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">and anyway my hope</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.640" end="01:18:24.000" style="s2">is that all of these different entities</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:27.040" style="s2">are going to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.000" end="01:18:30.400" style="s2">the shared objective at a system</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:31.920" style="s2">that works with minimal architecture and</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.400" end="01:18:33.600" style="s2">that they will join forces because</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.920" end="01:18:35.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a much more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.600" end="01:18:36.800" style="s2">response to the problems that we find</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.360" end="01:18:38.640" style="s2">ourselves with</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.800" end="01:18:40.080" style="s2">than each of us trying to solve our</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.640" end="01:18:41.520" style="s2">problem individually and</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.080" end="01:18:43.600" style="s2">thinking that those other projects have</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.520" end="01:18:45.360" style="s2">nothing to do with it yep</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.600" end="01:18:46.640" style="s2">i realized i skipped one and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.360" end="01:18:47.040" style="s2">comment so i&#39;ll go back to it and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.640" end="01:18:49.600" style="s2">we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.040" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">the last two wait until the pro rioting</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.600" end="01:18:52.880" style="s2">lady realizes that many words in english</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:53.760" style="s2">that refer to government institutions</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.880" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">come from the norman</p>

<p begin="01:18:55.520" end="01:18:59.360" style="s2">interested there&#39;s a very good language</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.040" end="01:19:01.280" style="s2">focus on this</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.360" end="01:19:03.760" style="s2">i admit i don&#39;t know what words we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.280" end="01:19:03.760" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.480" end="01:19:07.840" style="s2">can either of you offer your insights on</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.239" end="01:19:10.560" style="s2">styles of instruction between</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.840" end="01:19:12.080" style="s2">institutions methods shared in academic</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.560" end="01:19:14.320" style="s2">learning or medical training versus</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.080" end="01:19:17.440" style="s2">corporate or military style training</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.320" end="01:19:19.199" style="s2">any observations would be appreciated</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.440" end="01:19:20.800" style="s2">god there&#39;s just there&#39;s so much to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.199" end="01:19:23.199" style="s2">about education and</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.800" end="01:19:25.440" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t we know less about for</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.199" end="01:19:28.560" style="s2">instance exactly what happens within</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.440" end="01:19:30.960" style="s2">say military um or even</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.560" end="01:19:32.159" style="s2">even at medical schools um one important</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.960" end="01:19:35.120" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.159" end="01:19:35.520" style="s2">being that when there is an understood</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.120" end="01:19:37.040" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.520" end="01:19:38.560" style="s2">you know in something that can be called</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.040" end="01:19:39.840" style="s2">a trade school or professional school</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.560" end="01:19:42.880" style="s2">where you&#39;re there to</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.840" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">become a doctor or become a coder or</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.880" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:48.159" style="s2">there is less room in the curriculum for</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:50.080" style="s2">exploration and</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.159" end="01:19:52.000" style="s2">for just kind of sitting around and</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.080" end="01:19:53.920" style="s2">exchanging ideas and you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.000" end="01:19:56.560" style="s2">the goal is and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.920" end="01:19:58.000" style="s2">um liberal arts is supposed to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.560" end="01:20:00.640" style="s2">supposed to provide</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.000" end="01:20:01.040" style="s2">room for exploration such that uh you</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.640" end="01:20:03.520" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.040" end="01:20:05.040" style="s2">not only be your best self so so that</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.520" end="01:20:05.679" style="s2">you can go out into the world and make a</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.040" end="01:20:08.560" style="s2">difference and</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.679" end="01:20:09.760" style="s2">and and make a living but also become</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.560" end="01:20:12.000" style="s2">your best self</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.760" end="01:20:14.239" style="s2">uh so those that&#39;s one distinction that</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.000" end="01:20:18.320" style="s2">i would make that is an important one</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.239" end="01:20:21.360" style="s2">um i would argue that the hidden</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.320" end="01:20:23.920" style="s2">secret to improving education in</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.360" end="01:20:25.360" style="s2">everything is understanding the</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.920" end="01:20:28.560" style="s2">motivational structures</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.360" end="01:20:31.600" style="s2">underneath and that what we saw with</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.560" end="01:20:32.080" style="s2">people educated in the standard way who</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.600" end="01:20:33.679" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:36.000" style="s2">came to us is that they very often had</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.679" end="01:20:38.000" style="s2">perverse incentives built into</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.000" end="01:20:39.280" style="s2">their mode in other words if you were a</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.000" end="01:20:41.840" style="s2">very good student</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.280" end="01:20:43.440" style="s2">and being a good student got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.840" end="01:20:44.080" style="s2">accolades from the people at the front</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.440" end="01:20:46.000" style="s2">of the room</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.080" end="01:20:47.600" style="s2">maybe you got very focused on what the</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.000" end="01:20:49.040" style="s2">people at the front of the room</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.600" end="01:20:50.719" style="s2">thought rather than what was actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.040" end="01:20:52.639" style="s2">true which meant that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.719" end="01:20:53.679" style="s2">innovate beyond what the person at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.639" end="01:20:55.360" style="s2">front of the room knew</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.679" end="01:20:56.480" style="s2">because they would think it was wrong</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.360" end="01:20:57.520" style="s2">and you would have to have the courage</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.480" end="01:21:00.560" style="s2">of your convictions</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.520" end="01:21:01.600" style="s2">which you hadn&#39;t learned the the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.560" end="01:21:05.440" style="s2">taste for</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.600" end="01:21:07.520" style="s2">so in all of these things you want</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.440" end="01:21:09.040" style="s2">the person to want to engage in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.520" end="01:21:12.639" style="s2">exercise that makes them</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.040" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">smarter or wiser and you want success to</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.639" end="01:21:16.719" style="s2">line up exactly with the thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:18.719" style="s2">that they should accomplish when they</p>
