<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">we could try and pick that engine apart</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">and see where</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">what it really is and where it&#39;s at and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">how it functions and develop it at depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">um but given that the world is where it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">um me and other</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">metamodernists have primarily focused on</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">like okay we we kind of get roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">new philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">there are a lot of details and depths to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">be to be developed</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">we need to hurry history along a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">bit and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">um run a little bit put put the card</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">before the horse</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">sometimes uh so and start inventing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">stuff for politics for for the world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">which is dangerous we&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">culturally we&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">psychologically etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">uh and yet there&#39;s an urgency because of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">the climate change thing and because of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">a bunch of other existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">because of institutional decay</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:39.199" style="s2">that has to do with with the internet</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">and with the global society</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">so this particular day</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">or well so so so uh peter asked</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">about uh what what could you be talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">about on this uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2">on this since maker residence thing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.960" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">i thought about it it&#39;s like well i</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">always end up saying roughly what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">the books right</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">and there we do have lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">uh metamodernism can be applied to other</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">and um and there is a sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">from which all of this stuff comes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">particularly what&#39;s usually most</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">interesting to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">just not hasn&#39;t been the highest</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:23.759" style="s2">priority for uh for writing and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">is stuff like this subtle stuff this the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.759" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">touchy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">like hmm what are the layers of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">of phenomenological experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">uh well wilbur calls them four bodies</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">how does that translate into a secular</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">realized philosophy into a a new</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">how how is spirituality to be reinvented</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">how is religion to be invented and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">thought well the best way to start</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">is actually some of these themes will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">touched upon in the next book</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">the best way to start is in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">already profound and deep and important</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">but not that deep so we&#39;ll go into</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">the arts and aesthetics today um and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a critique that&#39;s leveled against</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">me sometimes wait wait a minute this guy</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.160" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">is in an art scholar and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">and he hasn&#39;t even read all the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">meta modernists uh who who</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">who comment on all the netflix shows and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">and literature and stuff and that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">um what i bring to the table is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">is not the details of each painting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">basically only the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">viewed from a meta modern philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">standpoint and i also define that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">differently than do of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">the dutch metamodernist scholars and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:50.720" style="s2">um so what we&#39;ll be doing here</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">is we&#39;ll try to understand a few a few</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.720" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">core concepts</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">really of how the arts develop</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">and what is beauty</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">um and uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">be able to get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">uh the meta memes what they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">as uh so modern society post modern</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">critique of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">that and meta modernist we&#39;ll we&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">to get a sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">as viscerally as possible so i would</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">like to share my screen if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">all right uh yes i do have that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">well sorry planning here you go um</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:38.199" style="s2">so the title of this this little talk is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.199" end="00:07:42.639" style="s2">participatory beauty is the generator</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">function so another of the sense makers</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">daniel</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">schmuckenberger has this term the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">generator function</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">and he says we have to change the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">generator function of society</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">and generator function would be well</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">some kind of some kind of code or some</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.319" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">piece of well it&#39;s like a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">equation that&#39;s at the center</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">or chord but maybe beyond our grasp</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">but which nevertheless generates all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">this like the structure of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">on what what we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">um and the easiest way</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">i would argue to get that generator</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">function what it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">is to get it intuitively um</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">ah yeah yeah thank you thank you we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">uh at the presentation mode uh so</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">one moment a slideshow from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">there you go um and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">the the best way to try to get it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">thanks thanks somebody wrote to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">privately here</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">so the this generator function is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">hmm there is a fundamental logic</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">that steers roughly what goes on in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">kind of culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">and i call those different</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">those are different logics the meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">memes</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">so we go from from animistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">and the paleolithic times to to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">faustian which well bronze age times</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">roughly and so on to um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">and and iron age for that matter to</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">uh post-fastian which</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">is well in spiral and i&#39;m just called</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">blue and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">traditional societies where we have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">these big religions and so on</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">from there on to modern and from modern</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">to post-modern from modern</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">post-modern to meta-modern and at each</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">the generator function changes um</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:03.519" style="s2">so um and and there it&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">easy way to to to see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.519" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">or to understand that and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:15.010" style="s2">look at the pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">um in early egypt empire</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.010" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">and then fast forward 1000 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">look at the pyramids so the new pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">build 1000 years later</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">they have roughly the same hieroglyphs</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">they&#39;ll be a little bit more intricate</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">but that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">you know it will look as though the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">had made it maybe just a few years later</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">from our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">it will look as though the same person</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">has made</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">the art that was made a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">now egypt is a maybe an unfair example</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">was a highly highly conservative society</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">you can do the same thing for uh for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">lot of the early</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">um early societies out there you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">look at african art</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">and you you there&#39;s just no no</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">way in hell you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">mix it up with viking art it just just</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">they look so different and the viking</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.760" end="00:11:24.399" style="s2">art looks fairly similar across</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">looks as though the same artist there</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">and then you can go to mesoamerica</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">then you can go to china then you can go</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">to the middle east</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">each of the civilizations have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">generator function</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">now um and they they</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">create art at a certain at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">degree of complexity or something if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">today you can see this is a picasso</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">and then you can go and say this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">pollock</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">etc the the particular artist will have</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">a thumbnail</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">which then differs because we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">much more complex society where in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">much more complex culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">we have a more complex generator</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">function so the degrees of freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">what can be created within culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">have increased um</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:21.120" style="s2">so throughout we&#39;ll be playing this</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">little game um</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.120" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be taken too</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:26.240" style="s2">seriously it&#39;s kind of just the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">background for the talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.240" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">um guess the meta meme well so we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">those uh those caves in france from</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">well they&#39;re very very old so uh and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">at the early animistic uh meta meme</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">most likely what what what makes them so</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:51.839" style="s2">well we see that there are not yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">real monsters there the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.839" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">human mind is fairly close to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">nature and undifferentiated from it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">has not yet differentiated out</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">maybe uh maybe they just tried to draw</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">many examples maybe they were practicing</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a spiritual element</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">to that they&#39;re transparent you can see</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">them uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">see many of them um but</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">uh they&#39;re they&#39;re highly alive and</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.920" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">looking at these two other ones if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">guess the meta meme</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">we would be at faustian or red or</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">um or in</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">a bronze age setting this is also like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">google bronze hr</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">here so we see this</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">first figurine that we have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">starting to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">we have started to combining many more</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">elements</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">and the second one also</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">we have is we are starting to combine</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">the fashion</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">of the person within this society</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">and uh we just</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">notice that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.760" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">close to what human beings look like</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">but at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">at some remove from natural society for</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">from from</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">the natural environment so</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">this is a pretty big jump though and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">we get into the question what is beauty</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">well so what these people are doing are</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:46.320" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:49.519" style="s2">not art in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.320" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">common sense of the term we wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.519" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">this is an artist because that&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">that comes much much later and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">a division</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">that happens in the 1800s with a with</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">or maybe maybe 1600s or or earlier</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">but um but in full</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">it hits home really only in the 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">when modernity hits home at</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">very very strongly and the artist</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">becomes a category onto him or herself</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">and art becomes a category in onto</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">so here earlier it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">differentiated from for instance</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">religion for us</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">art and religion are two different</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">things for these people not</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">so we also see that art is not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">not comment upon society etc uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">saying that we&#39;re seeing that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">expresses</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">this the society within it which it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">uh within within which it is placed</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">we go on guess the metamine</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">now this is very very different we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">made a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">long jump in</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">in time so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">these are of course this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">also religious art</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:18.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s not part of the modern period</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the post-fasting</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:23.759" style="s2">traditional</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">uh metamine nevertheless we can see</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.759" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">which civilization civilization it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">belongs to it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">incredibly integral intricate</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">but there can be no doubt which</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">this is part of so you see again</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">that even though you&#39;ve you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">increased a whole level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">here god is so abstract it&#39;s no longer a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">figurine</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone far far it&#39;s no longer an</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">image of a person</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just an abstract premonition of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">what could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:06.240" style="s2">what could be oh i can admit people now</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s just an abstract premonition of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">what the divine is it it points towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">the universal</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">it all goes to one point</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">and and this is of course islamic or or</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">arabic art and um</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">or maybe even person but it&#39;s an islamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">um and the the point here</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">is that there&#39;s such a huge</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">shift in abstraction from</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">uh the the god figurines there&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:46.400" style="s2">much much</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">more abstract um</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.400" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">thing going on generator function</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">so the sublime also reaches higher in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">it becomes more removed from everyday</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">and it reaches towards more</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">abstract or more otherworldly divinity</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">so beauty becomes more intricate</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">it coordinates more mastery</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">and it points towards a higher shared</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">pinnacle</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">so today&#39;s integral traditionalists for</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">instance and people on the far right</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">will hold that this was or in</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">christianity for instance with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">cathedral says this was the pinnacle of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">civilization in a large cycle</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">because at this point um you had</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">the the the cathedrals being</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">um the top at the top of society</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">uh the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">creation of sublime beauty under some</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">kind of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">was uh the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">primary aim of society above all</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">else and there was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">there were no worldly powers to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">challenge that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">um so so they will argue that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">since then it&#39;s been a downturn</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">now there are many we should be taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">that issue seriously and there are many</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">good counter arguments i</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">hope i can get back to that we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">discuss it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">and there&#39;s a certain validity to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">concern</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">that we&#39;ve lost this um</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">this unity</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">in the art projects this transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">of society</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">this uh this transcendence where</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">society itself and all of our governance</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">and all that we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">is for generations submitted</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">subdued by an aesthetic project</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">which is pretty awesome if you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">about it and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">i mean the the the far right there would</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">argue you walk through the louvre for</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">or the intellectual far right anyway you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">walk through the loop</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">and you compare it to</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know drab social democratic</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">uh brick buildings or or concrete</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">buildings in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">in in the communist east</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s where equality got us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">where democracy gets us because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">rational it&#39;s for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">or or the blandness of the european</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">union</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">it has nothing of this sublimity of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.559" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">i mean if you go to the museum of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">european union it&#39;s absolutely boring</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">and and all the all the uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">all the monuments that that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">there i mean some of them are a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">bit cute but but</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">really very few people skip a heartbeat</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:57.919" style="s2">over it right</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">um and of course it&#39;s because it tries</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">to be universal and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">inclusive and not offensive</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">which is the opposite of art</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">ah i&#39;m sorry i actually forgot the main</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">before i i am the main point</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">was when we look can i go back</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">now the more the for each such layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">what is beauty what is art art is</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">creation but is also than destruction</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">the more we add on each layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">the more we also destroy so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">higher transcendence will</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">require the greater destruction and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">is a this is a horrible horrible</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">nietzschean paradox but we can&#39;t escape</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">it so so this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">if we if we go to uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">let&#39;s see can i can i um uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">previous yeah if you go to this first</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">uh okay so you took some some cold</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">parts and you drew something but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t really destroy the wall</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">you didn&#39;t you you messed up a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">some bits of coal right</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">to make a sculpture you had to dig out</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:15.039" style="s2">this metal</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">you have to reshape it and not only did</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.039" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">you reshape</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">the metal and and extracted from from</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">much more much more from nature you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">also messed up the categories is this a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:29.679" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">being does it have animal eyes</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.679" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not sure anymore the same goes for</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">the next one you know you have to ruin</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">the tree to to get there and here</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">once you get far enough in the i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">this goes to many more layers but</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">once you get far enough you&#39;ve smashed</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">the categories to bits</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">until you reach pure abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">there&#39;s one universal god and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">emptiness and it&#39;s silence and all you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">is follow this right um</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">so so this is what goes on with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">generator functions this generator</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">they kick into place when things are</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">broken on the general on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">on the previous generator function</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">and they start generating culture out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">faster and and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2">more complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">rate which means they create a wider</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">variety</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">which at the same time destroys much</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:41.280" style="s2">and creates um creates higher complexity</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:41.280" style="s2">um and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">when it comes to matter of preference</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">uh that&#39;s something else we&#39;ll get back</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">to that we&#39;ll get back to the to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">matter of preference</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll find a better way to pause there</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">next one</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">and guess the meta meme uh well</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">so this is early modernity</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">and this is interesting because if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">look in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">an arts book in a textbook of arts and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">you or you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">you go and have a college degree in arts</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">they&#39;ll tell you yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">modern modern is it&#39;s like picasso it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">early 20th century but</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">those were words that were invented in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">those words were those labels uh came to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">be in a time before</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">we actually had a lot of um a lot of um</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">like developmental theories along these</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">lines</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">so they&#39;re quite an exact what they what</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">the reason they have those categories is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">basically that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">they feel that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">at high modernity uh you have cars and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">planes and people are walking around in</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">the malaya</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">malay of downtown</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">traffic and they&#39;re speaking on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">phone and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">participating in democracies in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">capitalist market</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:10.400" style="s2">and this art shows up at that time so of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">course you&#39;re going to call it modern</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">art modernist art</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">now then the issue is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">um if you look at the meta memes</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">history is skewed or development is</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">skewed</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">it takes 500 years at least for</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">to get from just a concept in the arts</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">to um a full</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">blown political system and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">logic to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">let&#39;s say there&#39;s a logic to modernity</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">the logic is um well that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">mr</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">premodernity tradition so you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">everything is pointing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">can you guys see um my little pointer</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">i&#39;m pointing to this little</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">top yeah so everything is pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">this one universal principle or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">truth and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">there&#39;s one truth why wouldn&#39;t there be</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">well you&#39;re right well if it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">universal</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">why can&#39;t we all look at it together</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">uh and and we can all recognize it for</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">when we just we don&#39;t have to get it</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">just from one source</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">then then it has to be truly universal</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">right and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">fundamental shift of modernity now that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">happens in the arts before</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">it happens in first the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">revolution of the 1600s and then the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">the enlightenment of the 1700s and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">through a bunch of social</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">and political revolutions of the 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">yeah lances in the 1900s and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">full-blown</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:47.240" style="s2">modern society the majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">population of which maybe only</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.240" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">mid-century</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">uh became predominantly secular in many</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">many countries right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">what are these images well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">with the highest google ability this one</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">and they&#39;re in all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">they&#39;re in all the arts textbooks this</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">one is</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">dutch renaissance and this one is</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">italian renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">this one is dutch renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:21.039" style="s2">is his name yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">and he&#39;s one of the major major names of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">the dutch renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">and this is raphael now there are two</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">worth noticing here which are very very</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">i mean they say a lot about what</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">modernity truly</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">is and it&#39;s so fascinating that these</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:43.360" style="s2">things show up</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">separately and in parallel</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.360" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">at the dawn of modernity well so</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">the most well-known is of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">uh is of course the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">the italian renaissance now the italian</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">renaissance what it has</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">is perspective so you see this this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">uh plato&#39;s academy by rafael</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">um or whatever it&#39;s called and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">um and there is correct perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">so if you would look at a painting for</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">instance by</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">islamic artists a little bit earlier</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">you would have found that the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">the islamic artists drew the king bigger</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">even if he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">farther away why because well first of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:32.760" style="s2">all they didn&#39;t know perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">but second of all because nature is not</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.760" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">from culture and how here nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">revolts against culture talks back and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">we have our own laws we have our own</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">space our own dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">if you have your social little life and</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">your little ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">within within the larger framework of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">nature you better place it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">in these three dimensions so</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">and and that becomes kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">playing field there</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">now that sounds a lot like something</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">uh one one moment if we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">other one</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">john van iack</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a little mirror there</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:20.160" style="s2">where you can see the married couple or</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">newlyweds um</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.160" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">from from the other side uh now what</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">the dutch renaissance did they always</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">they also approached this photographic</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">precision</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">i mean they&#39;re not quite photographed</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">yet but that&#39;s what they approached</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">and uh they did it by</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">just they broke up</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">whatever they were looking at into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">tiniest pixels and they looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">details and they added detail and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">added detail and added detail</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">until reality came back on the painting</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">including like minute details</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">like a mirror even the painter is then</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">so that the painter admits to being part</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">of this study and then of course we</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">could go into other</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:15.200" style="s2">things that um yeah i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">pause there i&#39;m just saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">first one here</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">is a lot like deduction</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">meaning the scientific method of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">deduction</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">wait a minute if this then that this</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">rule says that then</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">and the the figures in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">in this image to the right the raphael</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">are placed deductively</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">if this is placed there then according</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">to our own model</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">this should be placed there and at that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">you use a deductive model which is one</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">of the two</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">primary methods of science you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">you have used induction you have used</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna see i&#39;m gonna add another case</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">is it right is it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">and basically you treat what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">looking at as a bunch of pixels and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.919" style="s2">is this the same color as that yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">no it&#39;s not okay then i&#39;ll change it</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.919" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">and then you go like that until you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">depicted reality and voila</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">modern life comes out of the screen of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">these two</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">images and into</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">first science and that&#39;s what i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:35.360" style="s2">to say before</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">on on science then like and why was even</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.360" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">leonardo da vinci</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">so interested in science because he</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">wanted to be a better painter so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">could see and a sculpture</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">uh which was what led him to study</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">anatomy in the first place and then that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">led him on a bunch of other concerns but</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">uh but the very fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">uh i mean the the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">the doing or the uh the participation in</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">pulled forth uh the scientific endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">which i mean the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">starts literally here</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">in north italy um</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">so so so there&#39;s a very close connection</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">and yeah and there you can really see</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">the art within the metame this is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">best and clearest example really</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">we know modernity so well because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">so well studied</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">so and i think i mean hey it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">crusade i&#39;m gonna fight</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">but maybe maybe someone somewhere out</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.399" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">would like to change our vocabulary we</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be calling</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">contemporary art modern art we should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">calling</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">picasso a modernist for instance</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">which brings us to of course guess the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">metameme</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">um so i&#39;ll let you in on what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">googled</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">well of course i googled picasso</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve googled um a google</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">pollock my googled world</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">and i go to google futurist painting i</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">actually didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t save the name but</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">futurist is the oldest one of these and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">this one is the youngest one but looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">at the futurist painting</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">you see that well we&#39;ve gone into</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">abstraction we&#39;ve gone into abstract art</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone into contemporary art so</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">eventually the arts became photographic</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">they started being post photographic so</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.600" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">they looked</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">in romantic time they started looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">more and more like</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">instagram like you had a filter on or</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">something and it looked like a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">bit more extra magical so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">notice and that kind of stuff still is</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">with us</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">to this day on i don&#39;t know fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">books and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">but uh eventually</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">that project breaks now you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">photograph and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">and the artists become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">as such not as painters at the court</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">not as decorators of churches not as</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">uh expression expressers of religious</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">uh of religious truths uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">or or servants of the truth they become</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">artists</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:46.839" style="s2">themselves and then there are a few then</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">themes so one here the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">modernity isn&#39;t still it&#39;s a moving</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">target and it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">faster and faster and we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">able to shape that one we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">able to change the narratives of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the theme you can see</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">in futurist</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">uh in futurist paintings so and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:12.240" style="s2">also futures tend to be one</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">want to be a little bit tough uh and uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.240" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">and they wanna uh show that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">in this flurry and chaos will somehow</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">come out on top will somehow shape where</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">this whole thing is going</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">so of course there is a very close</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">connection between the earth this</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">early postmodern theme all of these are</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">post-modern expressions of what i would</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">call post-modern art in terms of meta</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">memes so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">even if it says something different in</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">the in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">art books in the textbooks on art i</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">would hold in terms of meta memes these</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:49.599" style="s2">all within the post-modern meta meme and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">again it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.599" end="00:35:55.560" style="s2">society was post-modern just as</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have modern society in in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.560" end="00:36:01.280" style="s2">1400s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">or fifteen hundreds in italy and and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.280" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">and uh the netherlands</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">uh so we didn&#39;t have post-modern society</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">in 1910 or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">um but but the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">the arts were already there they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:17.520" style="s2">already criticizing the world were</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">already overturning</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">the modern order and the modern progress</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to shape it</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.280" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">and so on now if you go overboard with</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">trying to shaping modern society</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:31.359" style="s2">and you combine it with some earlier not</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">meta memes but value means as we&#39;ll soon</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">get to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">you uh you get in that art war against</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">reality and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">plaster the same aesthetics onto all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">until the same simplified generator</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">function and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">fascism so and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">literally what they did hitler literally</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">designed</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">the the symbol of the of the nasdaq</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">party and and so on</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">and um i mean he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">invent the swastikas foster has been</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:07.040" style="s2">around for thousands of years but he</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">literally designed it and drew that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.040" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">thing with the coloring and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">then plus</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">got a lot of people to go along and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">plastering this all over</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s parathesis but it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">noting</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">now that if you look at picasso what</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">have we here</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">so he knows perspective but he re</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">consciously revolts against perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">aha so you have perspective change</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">parallax view you have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">you have a kind of surrealism that grows</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">you never know quite what&#39;s real um</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">you have that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">art should should be revealing also of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">the human being in her newness and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">nakedness and that we are um</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">we are helpless uh um</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">in well we we are helpless when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">to maintaining our</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">our dick course and so on if the arts</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">really check us you know and and in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">same period you have of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">the post-modern artists are going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">revolt</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">against the modern category of art so</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">this duchamp guy goes and brings a</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">toilet</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">and puts it on the stage and or on a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">pedestal and says</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">like look by definition this is art and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">people are talking about it to this day</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">so the next year pollock so they</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">actually showed</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">in in research later on that uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">pollock&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">paintings were you know just splash lots</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">of color that they&#39;re not random and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a progression</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">and he falls kind of fractal pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">this practical</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">fractals apparently get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">complex as his</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:55.839" style="s2">as his um as his</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:55.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">career advances but but the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">here is it&#39;s expressionism so it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">that he wants to pour out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">invisible</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">to the scientific community and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.839" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">and you can can&#39;t be put in three</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.839" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">and which is probably why he goes</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">fractal and probably why he goes like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">okay there&#39;s just no way to express i</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">could draw an image but it will just</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">translate into something else i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">gonna express it purely</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">and yeah and that&#39;s on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:32.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">of so you see these post modernities</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.200" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">multi-perspectivalism revolt against</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">you have um uh authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">this the same as in early early</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">20th century aesthetics like in in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">study of aesthetic with walter benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">that that he he brings up these exact</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">now eventually in the at the pinnacle of</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">you find that when this this post</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">modernism of course also is a wave or a</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">move so you find aha we go from</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">modernity is moving wow wow wow we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">shift the directions and perspectives of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">it hello picasso and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">we then we go to wait a minute uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:19.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not really getting to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">core of it we also need</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.040" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">to really really really fully and truly</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">express</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:27.599" style="s2">ourselves and then you kind of go on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">full 7 because nobody&#39;s really home</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.599" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">and what you end up is like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">minute there&#39;s no difference between art</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">and anything else this is just one out</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">of many games</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:40.319" style="s2">and here we are trying to shape this</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">and if there is no clear progress and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">there are no clear dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">and uh and we need to be critical at</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">least we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">just admit that art</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">fine art the fine arts are not different</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:40:59.680" style="s2">from from</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">the rest of culture including popular</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">arts</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">and we can admit that the world is flat</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">that there wasn&#39;t so much depth in there</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">after all</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">and that once you turn these things</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">around many times enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">you notice a certain kind of flatness of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">predictability to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">that the artists themselves will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">playing roles will be putting on a show</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">voila we have warhol</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">and then we end with a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">now today you go to contemporary arts</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">museum and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">i mean they&#39;re they&#39;re nice and fun in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">but new stuff usually is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">boring</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:42.000" style="s2">because we kind of been stuck in a rut</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">here because then the arts have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.000" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">defined as</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">okay so this is what&#39;s ours what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">arts are</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do roughly these things and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">then people do roughly these things</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">and it was fun and cool when it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.880" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">invented</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">but nowadays it&#39;s alienating and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">little bit boring</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">and then it also alienates the middle</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">class or</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">uh like i&#39;m just not not art interested</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:07.839" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of culture war because</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.839" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">then then</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">the the idea would be of course that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">well if you can&#39;t appreciate this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">not educated enough or</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">where you don&#39;t have enough style or</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">class or etcetera and people of course</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">gonna fight that narrative and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">gonna say you&#39;re a phony</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">uh so so right now we&#39;re in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">embittered</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">uh battle and we&#39;ve been stuck here for</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:32.240" style="s2">basically since</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">since world&#39;s time um</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.240" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">and and really it is phony a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">just just frankly and it is stuck in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:45.340" style="s2">rut and people are right</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">to to to revolt against it</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.340" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">um so we&#39;re getting there towards</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">a meta modern metameme so why did i pick</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">a solar punk image well</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">there are a couple of ideas linked to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">this well first of all i think solar</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">pump could be</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">a good outlet for for uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">for uh meta modern projects out there in</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">i think uh today unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">non-democratic countries or societies i</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">should say like singapore</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">uh kind of have the upper hand when it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">comes to creating</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">very engaging and like</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">full spectrum experience uh aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">urban livable spaces right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">and uh democratic societies uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.319" style="s2">well we&#39;re the ones looking drab kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.319" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">uh kind of like in the um</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">in the 1900s with east berlin and west</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">berlin the east berlins would like</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">to save up like wow this is a cornflakes</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">package i&#39;m going to save it here and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">yeah just because it kind of looked</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">shiny and they wanted this glow and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">yeah and they wanted an abba</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">lp or whatever and and right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:10.160" style="s2">the the non-democratic societies tend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.160" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">and people will go to singapore and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">they&#39;ll come home and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">say stuff like they would have said on</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">like 100</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.480" style="s2">or maybe 70 years ago when they went to</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">the states right the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.480" end="00:44:24.160" style="s2">states oh which was so impressive was so</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:27.359" style="s2">shiny</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.160" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">but but no more right that people say</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.359" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">well the streets were shoddy blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:35.440" style="s2">poverty um and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">whereas whereas people go to singapore</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.440" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">and they say it&#39;s an ideal society and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">well you know you can&#39;t replace the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">so so um so uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">where am i going with this well i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">we need aesthetic movements</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">like these that could be take up the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">metamodern space so of course i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">admittedly it&#39;s also a little bit corny</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">but it can it</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">leaves some some</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have all the it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">quite enough of the post-modern irony</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">and distance</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit too utopian sure you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:22.720" style="s2">can see</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.480" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">they did include that rust has has</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.720" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">has run on some of the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">um signs here and so on but the point</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">here is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">we&#39;re going into a position where</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:39.319" style="s2">po meta modernism is defined of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">as the diff has the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.319" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">extrapolation or extrapolation or</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">um the oscillation between modern and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">postmodern so you include</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">the modern progress and so on</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">and you include also the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.599" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">distance and self-critique and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">it actually puts us back</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">a lot in this space here where we were</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">futurism it&#39;s a very dangerous place to</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">be we start imagining futures we start</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">digital society can can melt things away</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">really fast we can destroy whole worlds</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">and we can create whole worlds and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">we can uh create a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">shared experience of creating new worlds</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of obvious and in in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">tries to be like whoa</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">uh it would kind of like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:49:59.440" style="s2">speak to a</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">like it it&#39;s a little bit too obvious it</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.559" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">tries a little bit too much</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t have self irony</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">not that i&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">maybe all of this is an ironic stunt i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">not sure what we&#39;re looking at here is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:20.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">is the flat earth society and this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.640" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">their symbol and this is how they</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">present at a conference and you can also</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">see with the coloring and so on</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">so what i&#39;m getting at here is that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">flat earth society even</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">using all the modern stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">in our day and age um</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">i can bring this here so yeah using all</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">stuff in the modern age um they still</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">express</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">a fairly low value</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">so and this is interesting right you</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">swing</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">like that&#39;s how you can see</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">which things are going to work</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">with a with a more complex global</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">culture and which things</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">aren&#39;t right so on a on a very visceral</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m not exactly sure what the method</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">is here</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">but to me it&#39;s fairly obvious like well</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:17.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">looks simple</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.760" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">hysterical corny whatever and it looks</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">low value meme um</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">so and that&#39;s that just means</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">that it won&#39;t include</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">a lot of the for instance postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">stuff a lot of the modern stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">it will express another kind of culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">which is fine we want a broad expression</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">the point i&#39;m making here is that beauty</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">then is uh is</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">allied to different expressions of um</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">of uh power relations and different</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re they&#39;re battling each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:00.880" style="s2">out different aesthetics right so some</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">people are gonna want</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.880" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">reality and society to have certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">expressions</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">now uh this one to the left or</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.240" style="s2">to the right you can say the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.240" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">alpha baptist church like i i can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">why you know but somehow it&#39;s i mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">why is that i&#39;m not sure but let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">at it well</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">well there there&#39;s something about how</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">it tries to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">really modern and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:44.960" style="s2">and and yet isn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">and somehow also that the message is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">into it it doesn&#39;t leave a lot to for</p>

<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">contemporary art it&#39;s from our days</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">um it&#39;s about spiritual and psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">experience right</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:55.680" style="s2">and we can we can see that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a genuine profundity to this</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.680" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">artist right</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">because well he might also have might</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">he&#39;s expressing he&#39;s making this up</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">himself right</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">uh and what what does he see well he</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">notices that</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">the world is more colorful and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">and sharply colorful than our eyes</p>

<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">he notices there there is an intricate</p>

<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:33.680" style="s2">all things behind he notice there there</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">are vast spaces and vast openings</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.680" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">beyond you and inside you and that there</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.319" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">is no clear boundary between the inner</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:40.319" style="s2">and the outer</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">all of these are expressed that there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.319" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">an ideal self a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">shines in this go golden light of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">dawn that you see</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">in this and this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:55.359" style="s2">well alex don&#39;t remember his name but</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like the the number one integralist</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.359" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">uh alex something his uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">his uh the number one integralist artist</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">and this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">this art piece of art is also exemplary</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:14.240" style="s2">of the other major movement</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">of what people have said should</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.240" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">should and can and will come after post</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:21.119" style="s2">modernism</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">um that there&#39;s a next developmental</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.119" end="00:55:23.680" style="s2">stage after post-modern and they called</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">integral or</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">or and i&#39;ve been very much part of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">as well and and feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">still feel closely bound to this</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">movement but</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">looking at the aesthetics i mean we</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">should be suspicious here</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">why well it doesn&#39;t include</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:45.599" style="s2">self-iron and it doesn&#39;t leave a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">for a difference of perspectives and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.599" end="00:55:48.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">a lot for um</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.990" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">well it&#39;s there&#39;s nothing it really put</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s not very far away from this</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:55:59.920" style="s2">if we think about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">oh the only one road leads to heaven</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.920" end="00:56:04.799" style="s2">jesus christ is the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.599" end="00:56:06.960" style="s2">is not so far away from that and it just</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.799" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">i mean this literally points at some</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.960" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">kind of a mega point over there</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:12.079" style="s2">uh this is how shiny things are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.079" end="00:56:15.440" style="s2">have a spiritual experience if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">integral if you buy into our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.440" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">um and hey what</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">and just like more more fundamentally we</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">put this up like let&#39;s say i have this</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:31.520" style="s2">strong spiritual experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">and i look at alex yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.520" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">this guy&#39;s a painting and i put it up on</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">the wall</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">and then i bring in my friend who</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the same experience and</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">um the same um</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">ideas about integralism and so on</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">what will he think of me or she</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">they will think that i&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">that i&#39;m deluding myself and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.839" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">um that i believe in woo-woo stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">and chances are they would be right</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">so i mean metamodernism the reason</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">that we picked up metamodernis as a term</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">instead of integralism well there were a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:22.559" style="s2">few others as well but the main one</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:25.920" style="s2">is a design intervention it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.559" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">this is the generator function they try</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.920" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">to place the the aesthetic generator</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:32.280" style="s2">function they try to place</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">to create this super inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.280" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">multi-perspectival movement that will</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">integrate all of the form of metamoves</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:44.799" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:46.480" style="s2">because the aesthetics are too corny</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.799" end="00:57:48.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to exclude most of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.480" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">people and they&#39;re going to lead to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.000" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">magical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to be too hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">creation of cults which they have</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">uh laura you wanted to break in oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">i just wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:03.280" style="s2">that we are at the hour mark just you</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">know yeah okay wonderful oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.280" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">i always talk longer than i imagined</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">this looked so small in my brain when i</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">yeah okay sorry uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">okay go on and on uh guess the value</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">i i i wasn&#39;t nervous when i started i</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:21.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t have enough to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">hey uh guess the value mean here then</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.280" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">so this is what you get if you google</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:28.799" style="s2">meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">art um and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.799" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">artists much more sophisticated than</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">myself in the art world and so on</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">or artists or at least art scholars they</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">they they bring up</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">examples such as these and they discuss</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">them in long</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:47.760" style="s2">frankly often pretty boring uh papers</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:50.880" style="s2">but uh they have something</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.760" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">uh going on like which i do think</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.880" end="00:58:54.400" style="s2">they&#39;re on to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">there is something going on here like</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.400" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">what do we get in this first one</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:04.559" style="s2">um you get um</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:08.160" style="s2">that you have um um</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.559" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">you have realism</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.160" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">yes it looks fairly realistic this could</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">be the real world</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:18.480" style="s2">but at the same time there&#39;s a slight</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">hint of fantasy in there right</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.480" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">and you get indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:26.240" style="s2">aspects but in a modern setting which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">solar pump but not</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">punk but just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">and and it leaves a lot unknown a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:40.400" style="s2">unsaid what is this place who lives</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:44.799" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">why did they construct it um and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.799" end="00:59:49.520" style="s2">it looks like a church kind of so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:52.240" style="s2">probably a spiritual place but we</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.520" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">we don&#39;t know exactly uh so the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.240" end="00:59:58.040" style="s2">point here is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="01:00:00.960" style="s2">you have well some kind of critical</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.040" end="01:00:04.319" style="s2">reappraisal reappraisal of</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.960" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">former effective or</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.319" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">former meta memes um</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s not in your face and you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:15.520" style="s2">some kind of spirituality some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:18.079" style="s2">hope of some kind of different future</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.520" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s pretty subtle and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.079" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">of the space we want to be in</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:27.200" style="s2">for meta-modern art same here</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">like you see this boy he&#39;s in a mundane</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.200" end="01:00:29.520" style="s2">setting</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.760" end="01:00:31.680" style="s2">but there&#39;s still something magical</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.520" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">about the picture and where is the map</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.680" end="01:00:36.160" style="s2">does the magic come from</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">it comes from just the natural world</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.160" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">just the reality he looks at himself</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:47.040" style="s2">in this melting ice pot</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">pond and and you kind of get a magical</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.040" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">sense but you can&#39;t exactly say where</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:52.799" style="s2">the magic is coming from</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:53.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s terribly mundane at the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.799" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:58.559" style="s2">it&#39;s fairly magical like</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:00.240" style="s2">seriously which is the most spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.559" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">this one</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.240" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">or that one well maybe this one is more</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">spiritual in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">in terms of like it describes a more</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">far-out experience it does</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">but i kind i mean the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:17.760" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">that i feel more often connected to</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.760" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">is better expressed than this one so</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.920" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">this is more</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">met in modern art and i think that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2">modern art scholars many of whom or most</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">of whom wouldn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">myself who who is the modern political</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:35.599" style="s2">and has an explicit program with what i</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">do and so on</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.599" end="01:01:40.720" style="s2">um very very very much on to something</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.720" end="01:01:46.880" style="s2">and this kind of aesthetic is how</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">i think movements for the future a much</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.880" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">more careful</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">movement for the future should be should</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">be looking um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">and we also kind of get rid of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">hysterical movement there in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:02:01.280" style="s2">futurism</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:03.599" style="s2">ah okay this was actually it so i want</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:06.640" style="s2">to say one more thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.599" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">so um mad and modern</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.640" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">art uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">it get we gets a little bit confusing</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:18.640" style="s2">then when</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:20.559" style="s2">we well actually i&#39;ll say two things</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.640" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">first of all we reintroduce magic and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.559" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">hope vis-a-vis</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:27.039" style="s2">the post-modern art so that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">main that&#39;s the main difference there</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.039" end="01:02:34.400" style="s2">we also reintroduced more</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:36.510" style="s2">of craftsmanship so those those two</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.400" end="01:02:38.559" style="s2">last paintings we looked at</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.510" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.559" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">if you show up because of yourself you</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">have to explain why somebody</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">why this wasn&#39;t made by your</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.160" end="01:02:51.359" style="s2">untalented neighbor like we&#39;re just any</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">random person off the street</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.359" end="01:02:55.039" style="s2">you have to explain it now this you</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have to explain that</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.039" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">an artist has made it right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">different so reintroduce that</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:04.559" style="s2">part which is from i mean of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">takes us back</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.559" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">uh all the way to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:13.440" style="s2">uh these paintings like it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">there&#39;s this was an</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.440" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">artist who made this that i was a crafts</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:25.520" style="s2">man who made this so uh so we put craft</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.160" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">back and put hope back we put magic in</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.520" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">but we put in like we didn&#39;t put in 99</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:35.039" style="s2">magic we put in 4 magic</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">so most people can just walk past it and</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.039" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">never be offended</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:42.799" style="s2">but it still has sublimity now</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">the last thing i wanted to say here</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.799" end="01:03:47.520" style="s2">is what we don&#39;t want is because</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:48.559" style="s2">metamodernism is used in different terms</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.520" end="01:03:51.920" style="s2">in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.559" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">different different uh different</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.920" end="01:03:58.799" style="s2">uh ways of grasping it</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.119" end="01:03:59.920" style="s2">or like delineating it it also has it</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.799" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">has both political</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.920" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">implications and and aesthetic and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">philosophical and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">and what not uh spiritual will get to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.359" end="01:04:15.039" style="s2">but think about socialist art</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">socialist art didn&#39;t fly</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.039" end="01:04:18.799" style="s2">they thought socialism was a higher</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">stage of society that comes after</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.799" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">capitalist society</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:23.359" style="s2">and then they start they say okay so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:26.960" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.359" end="01:04:29.760" style="s2">socialist artist yeah yeah i&#39;m socialist</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">and the the state would say yeah yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.760" end="01:04:32.480" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:34.319" style="s2">social start and they allied up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.480" end="01:04:35.039" style="s2">some futurist artists and so on and they</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.319" end="01:04:37.119" style="s2">designed</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.039" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">this this style which was cool for a</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.119" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">while and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">basically in the end socialist art that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">whatever stalin likes</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:49.119" style="s2">and something was good and a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.319" end="01:04:53.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.119" end="01:04:55.280" style="s2">but the point is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.200" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that so we&#39;re not looking</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.280" end="01:04:59.680" style="s2">for like</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.559" end="01:05:02.079" style="s2">a a book of like this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.680" end="01:05:03.119" style="s2">meta modernist art approved by the state</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.079" end="01:05:06.240" style="s2">or whatever</p>

<p begin="01:05:06.240" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not where we&#39;re going so be</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">careful when we approach this</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just a way and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:17.520" style="s2">for this reason of course uh the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">metamodern art scholars are</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.520" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">rightly careful about being prescriptive</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.640" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">because it just doesn&#39;t quite belong in</p>

<p begin="01:06:56.240" end="01:06:59.280" style="s2">well so what we have here is john ed</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:02.960" style="s2">marks</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.280" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">he is harvard or something and he</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.960" end="01:07:06.400" style="s2">um he makes these sculptures in</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:08.880" style="s2">mathematician</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.400" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">so what i would say this is where we</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.880" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">want that modern art</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:15.599" style="s2">to be going it doesn&#39;t look like art</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">anymore it already escaped</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.599" end="01:07:21.200" style="s2">the art uh gallery</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.880" end="01:07:23.119" style="s2">and in the art galleries that the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.200" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">progressive artists they like to go in</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.119" end="01:07:26.160" style="s2">and look in the labs why because the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:28.400" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.160" end="01:07:29.200" style="s2">truth seeking of scientists reveals</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.400" end="01:07:32.400" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.200" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">structures and just weirdest weirdest</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.400" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">visual effects and</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:37.760" style="s2">like mind-boggling effects that you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:41.119" style="s2">think of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.760" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">and they want to play with that and</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.119" end="01:07:45.359" style="s2">what happens then in the meta modern</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">this metamodern move</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.359" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">of art is that truth and truth seeking</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">is reintroduced</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:54.079" style="s2">and like uh but at an even more literal</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:07:57.359" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.079" end="01:07:59.119" style="s2">than in the modern project when and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.359" end="01:08:02.319" style="s2">placed at the center and heart</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.119" end="01:08:05.599" style="s2">of the meta modern arts project</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.319" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">which then expresses higher and more</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.599" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">transcendental beauty</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">as an expression of truth</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:14.000" style="s2">so mathematical truths in these</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.000" end="01:08:17.359" style="s2">become these sculptures they become</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">alive they are mesmerizing</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.359" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">they are eye-opening and so on um</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">but we didn&#39;t place we didn&#39;t fall for</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:31.279" style="s2">the temptation to place beauty first</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:34.480" style="s2">we saw that if we follow truth</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.279" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">and we try to speak truth at all times</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.480" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">find out what&#39;s true even if it hurts</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:41.120" style="s2">then play with it</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:42.159" style="s2">then we will create that greater beauty</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.120" end="01:08:45.679" style="s2">if we</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.159" end="01:08:47.199" style="s2">which is like i mean at this tempting</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.679" end="01:08:50.319" style="s2">moment here</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.199" end="01:08:53.440" style="s2">uh what you find in populism and</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.319" end="01:08:56.960" style="s2">and at the end other end of that spec</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:59.759" style="s2">at the end of that road fascism is</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.960" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">you you define truth or you define</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.759" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">beauty and then you try to press it upon</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:04.440" style="s2">the world your beauty</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">and you forget about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.440" end="01:09:09.759" style="s2">multi-perspectivalism you forget about</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:12.640" style="s2">the authenticity you forget about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.759" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">necessary from that flatness of it all</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.640" end="01:09:18.960" style="s2">and and and that&#39;s that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a real danger so so i want to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.960" end="01:09:24.080" style="s2">that um this</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">this aesthetic new movement that</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.080" end="01:09:29.040" style="s2">is subtly taking form and</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you guys can find many more and</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.040" end="01:09:34.719" style="s2">better examples and i have</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">um it can and should be a</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.719" end="01:09:38.799" style="s2">movement where um beauty follows from</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.799" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">and is somehow yet its transcendental</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:48.719" style="s2">quality um yeah i&#39;ll stop there</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:50.960" style="s2">and yeah sorry for taking so long</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.719" end="01:09:50.960" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.480" end="01:09:58.640" style="s2">can i stop sharing stop sharing</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.920" end="01:09:58.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll bear to you</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:02.719" style="s2">great yeah thanks for thanks for your</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.840" end="01:10:05.920" style="s2">presentation</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.719" end="01:10:06.400" style="s2">so um we have lots of questions in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.920" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">chat</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.400" end="01:10:12.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s start with rob hart</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:13.040" style="s2">because he got some plus ones rob would</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:16.719" style="s2">you like to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.040" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask how consciously</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.719" end="01:10:19.280" style="s2">does the artist</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">express the generator function of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.280" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:24.320" style="s2">how much of the expression is an overt</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:26.000" style="s2">effort to capture and express the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.320" end="01:10:28.000" style="s2">normativity of the culture and how much</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.000" end="01:10:29.440" style="s2">of it is accidental or unconscious on</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.000" end="01:10:31.679" style="s2">the artist&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.440" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">and would that answer change depending</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.679" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">on the culture&#39;s value meme</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.080" end="01:10:43.360" style="s2">so in any way you can say</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.440" end="01:10:44.880" style="s2">that each each step is within a</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.360" end="01:10:47.040" style="s2">you know you kind of climb out of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.880" end="01:10:50.159" style="s2">former you try to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.040" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">try to answer to that so</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.159" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">uh animist uh tries to climb out of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:58.199" style="s2">direct</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">uh non-representational part of being a</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.199" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">non-representational part of nature we</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:02.880" style="s2">say like</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.719" end="01:11:04.880" style="s2">we&#39;re actually not just nature we we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.880" end="01:11:06.000" style="s2">also seeing spirits and stuff we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.880" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">depicting nature</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.000" end="01:11:13.920" style="s2">and um and then you go from there</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:16.080" style="s2">to um to like actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.920" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">we&#39;re not part of nature at all we we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:20.640" style="s2">we have our own universe and</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">our own gods and and there&#39;s a god for</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">this and god for that and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:27.679" style="s2">like no actually actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:29.600" style="s2">we can climb out of that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.679" end="01:11:32.640" style="s2">just one universal truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.600" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">on it goes uh and the the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.640" end="01:11:36.840" style="s2">the most self-conscious it of course</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:38.960" style="s2">becomes at</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.840" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">post-modernism or where it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.960" end="01:11:42.960" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:45.199" style="s2">about being a self-conscious artist</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.960" end="01:11:46.640" style="s2">which comments upon your society</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.199" end="01:11:49.520" style="s2">and then trying to express something</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.640" end="01:11:51.920" style="s2">else now that being said</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.520" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no correlation between having</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.920" end="01:11:57.120" style="s2">this particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:12:00.239" style="s2">idea about meta memes and doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.120" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">what you do like expressing</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.239" end="01:12:03.840" style="s2">something through some medium by</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:05.840" style="s2">destroying something else</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.840" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s no correlation at</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.840" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">all so 99.9</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:12.000" style="s2">plus something percent of all artists</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:14.640" style="s2">are going to do it</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.000" end="01:12:16.080" style="s2">automatically in this in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.640" end="01:12:20.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2">sit down with me hear this model</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.880" end="01:12:27.520" style="s2">and then express it obviously so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">but so there&#39;s a both kind of both</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.520" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">answer it&#39;s all super automatic</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">unless you consider that everybody is of</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:38.239" style="s2">course reacting to</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">the former kind of or expressing</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.239" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">against the background of the former</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.320" end="01:12:47.840" style="s2">great um i one thing i forgot to note um</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:48.480" style="s2">please try and keep your follow-up</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.840" end="01:12:51.440" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.480" end="01:12:52.800" style="s2">or statements to one or two with that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.440" end="01:12:54.960" style="s2">rob did you have anything to follow up</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.800" end="01:12:54.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.760" end="01:12:59.199" style="s2">well i you know i agree and appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.080" end="01:13:01.120" style="s2">what you say about</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.199" end="01:13:02.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t study the models before they</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.120" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">produce the art</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:06.480" style="s2">and then i&#39;m fascinated by the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:08.560" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to climb out of</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.480" end="01:13:09.600" style="s2">the maybe the current movement that</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.560" end="01:13:12.719" style="s2">they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.600" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">and i wonder is the challenge of being</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.719" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">stuck in the rut with post-modernity</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">that there&#39;s nothing left to climb</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:23.040" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:26.159" style="s2">um so i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.040" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.159" end="01:13:30.840" style="s2">the egyptians fell stuck in a rut we</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">only feel stuck in iraq because we</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.840" end="01:13:34.159" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">certain things remarked we say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.159" end="01:13:37.760" style="s2">going to be new it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">shocking it&#39;s going to be mind-boggling</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.760" end="01:13:40.800" style="s2">and so on right</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to comment upon reality</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.800" end="01:13:44.400" style="s2">it will comment upon</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:46.320" style="s2">society and it&#39;s and therefore the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:48.719" style="s2">hundredth time</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.320" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">in a row somebody says well i made this</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.719" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">it comments upon</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:56.800" style="s2">how we view migration and it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:58.960" style="s2">and it kind of kind of always are those</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.800" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">same things and they&#39;re critical against</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.960" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">that they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">present any solution</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.199" end="01:14:08.400" style="s2">it&#39;s unclear entirely what you should</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:11.520" style="s2">actually do with it</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.400" end="01:14:12.840" style="s2">it problematizes rather than creates and</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.520" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.840" end="01:14:19.360" style="s2">um and then people are rightly</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:20.159" style="s2">left with you know sense of resistance</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.360" end="01:14:23.360" style="s2">against this</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.159" end="01:14:24.640" style="s2">and oftentimes this you know a load of</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.360" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">tax money</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.640" end="01:14:30.719" style="s2">goes into these projects so we&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:32.080" style="s2">because we kind of have that expectation</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.719" end="01:14:35.840" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.080" end="01:14:39.280" style="s2">i mean to get from one</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.840" end="01:14:42.880" style="s2">thousand meme or or a special one uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.280" end="01:14:43.920" style="s2">one metamean to the next there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.880" end="01:14:45.600" style="s2">gravity i mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.920" end="01:14:48.320" style="s2">all of the reference this person has</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.600" end="01:14:48.880" style="s2">ever seen and all of their upbringing</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.320" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">bring them</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.880" end="01:14:54.159" style="s2">just post-modern ideas and first there</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:57.440" style="s2">are low-hanging fruits people like them</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.159" end="01:14:59.360" style="s2">but there&#39;s a whole renaissance going on</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.440" end="01:15:02.480" style="s2">everybody&#39;s having lots of fun</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">uh everybody&#39;s inventing cool new stuff</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.480" end="01:15:06.560" style="s2">uh then after a while there are no more</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.120" end="01:15:09.040" style="s2">low-hanging fruits</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.560" end="01:15:10.400" style="s2">you have to get to the next level or</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.040" end="01:15:13.920" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.400" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">of of cultural development but to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.920" end="01:15:17.199" style="s2">that you have to go against</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.040" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">all that you already know and then then</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.199" end="01:15:25.840" style="s2">you tend to be stuck for a while</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:25.840" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.920" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">great um so lisa hogan had a question</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.040" end="01:15:33.280" style="s2">that i am going to read for her uh as we</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.440" style="s2">move towards new technology and further</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.280" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">mechanization of our lives bodies minds</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.440" end="01:15:37.760" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">how do you think this evolution will</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.760" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">impact the generator function</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.440" end="01:15:44.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very good question the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.600" end="01:15:47.920" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.640" end="01:15:50.159" style="s2">issue then is that art</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.920" end="01:15:50.960" style="s2">from being undifferentiated from other</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.159" end="01:15:53.760" style="s2">topics</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.960" end="01:15:54.159" style="s2">to becoming in modernity like religion</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.760" end="01:15:57.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.159" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">a bunch of other things a specific</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:04.719" style="s2">category two being challenged as such</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:05.520" style="s2">under post-modernity uh and and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.719" end="01:16:08.800" style="s2">leaking out</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.520" end="01:16:12.000" style="s2">other other things but just challenge</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.800" end="01:16:15.199" style="s2">just at the edges the</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.000" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">modern promise is to break it out</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.199" end="01:16:23.120" style="s2">of that um of its confines</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:25.520" style="s2">into leaking out like like</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.120" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why solar pump is so good</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.520" end="01:16:30.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:33.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a fantasy image</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.880" end="01:16:34.960" style="s2">but yet it&#39;s what&#39;s literally happening</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.600" end="01:16:37.840" style="s2">in in some cities</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.960" end="01:16:38.719" style="s2">and what most people would probably want</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.840" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">a lot of our</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.719" end="01:16:43.280" style="s2">urban landscapes to look like and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:46.080" style="s2">doable and it has something to do with</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.280" end="01:16:48.800" style="s2">uh both urban design and um and</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.080" end="01:16:51.199" style="s2">architecture and uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.800" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">and sustainable living and climate</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.199" end="01:16:55.760" style="s2">change and the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:59.199" style="s2">and resilience uh so</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.760" end="01:17:02.960" style="s2">and of course energy systems</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.199" end="01:17:05.040" style="s2">uh so it is in the space of</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:06.960" style="s2">not being real and being real at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.040" end="01:17:11.360" style="s2">same time like being</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.960" end="01:17:13.920" style="s2">so virtual that becomes hyper real so</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.360" end="01:17:14.640" style="s2">what meta-modern art will be will</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.920" end="01:17:16.719" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.640" end="01:17:17.920" style="s2">not be that&#39;s an interesting quite</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.719" end="01:17:21.199" style="s2">little modern</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.920" end="01:17:24.880" style="s2">uh like um exhibition</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.199" end="01:17:28.719" style="s2">at the of the metropolitan it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.880" end="01:17:31.520" style="s2">not that it breaks out of that prison</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.719" end="01:17:32.000" style="s2">and then transforms life itself becomes</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.520" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.000" end="01:17:37.040" style="s2">will then make our our lives much more</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:39.760" style="s2">like a work of art</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.040" end="01:17:40.960" style="s2">which is then a deeper liberation for</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.760" end="01:17:45.520" style="s2">emancipation of</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.960" end="01:17:48.640" style="s2">ourselves and our relationships um</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.520" end="01:17:51.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s a and that we the</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.640" end="01:17:52.719" style="s2">the generator function will be richer</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.040" end="01:17:54.880" style="s2">than which means that</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.719" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">the sheer number of combinations of</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.880" end="01:18:00.560" style="s2">things that can be invented</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.360" end="01:18:04.159" style="s2">become larger which means a higher</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.560" end="01:18:07.199" style="s2">expressiveness or or uniqueness shows up</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.159" end="01:18:09.679" style="s2">among many different people now</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.199" end="01:18:10.719" style="s2">of course then you also destroy more</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.679" end="01:18:13.840" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.719" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">when you create you also wreck</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.840" end="01:18:18.480" style="s2">which means that the risk of this whole</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:21.120" style="s2">thing falling apart and becoming</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.480" end="01:18:23.679" style="s2">either fascism or mad max society is</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.120" end="01:18:23.679" style="s2">very big</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.679" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">all right so alexandra had another</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.760" end="01:18:30.960" style="s2">question um</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:33.679" style="s2">that people were uploading alexander</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.960" end="01:18:33.679" style="s2">would you like to ask</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.800" end="01:18:39.040" style="s2">yeah sure um i was wondering whether</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.080" end="01:18:41.199" style="s2">metamod and</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.040" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">at could be described as one that</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.199" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">supports</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:45.440" style="s2">relationship between and elicits</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:49.199" style="s2">resonance</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.440" end="01:18:51.760" style="s2">in a series of value means eg fractal</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.199" end="01:18:51.760" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.840" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">yes hi alexander by the way</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.600" end="01:19:03.760" style="s2">uh so i agree</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:06.960" style="s2">but i say i agree</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.760" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.960" end="01:19:13.840" style="s2">so so meta modern art</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:14.960" style="s2">is first of all we break through from</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.840" end="01:19:19.280" style="s2">what we normally see</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.960" end="01:19:22.800" style="s2">as art we um we intuit</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.280" end="01:19:28.000" style="s2">something profound without putting it</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.800" end="01:19:28.000" style="s2">in your face too much we</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.280" end="01:19:32.480" style="s2">introduce craftsmanship through</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.280" end="01:19:35.360" style="s2">craftsmanship</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.480" end="01:19:36.560" style="s2">and we try to be more perspectival and</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.360" end="01:19:38.000" style="s2">integrative</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.560" end="01:19:41.199" style="s2">of many different meta means or</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.000" end="01:19:41.199" style="s2">perspectives but</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.679" end="01:19:45.600" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of in a cloud or like a venn</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:49.679" style="s2">diagram of these things</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.600" end="01:19:52.000" style="s2">so if you lack it&#39;s like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.679" end="01:19:52.880" style="s2">this this artwork doesn&#39;t integrate uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.000" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">east or west</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.880" end="01:19:57.520" style="s2">or listen to our uh like i see no post</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:19:57.840" style="s2">particular post-posting elements in this</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.520" end="01:20:00.080" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.840" end="01:20:01.360" style="s2">then this can&#39;t be meta-modern well we</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.080" end="01:20:03.840" style="s2">don&#39;t want a checklist</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.360" end="01:20:04.960" style="s2">like that right and the interval lists</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.840" end="01:20:06.560" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.960" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">they they used to think a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.560" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">like that uh that</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:11.120" style="s2">well you have these different color</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">codes and you have to include everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.120" end="01:20:14.320" style="s2">checklist check check check okay then</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.880" end="01:20:15.760" style="s2">this is individual</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.320" end="01:20:18.639" style="s2">no i think you missed that one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.760" end="01:20:22.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not how it works rather</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.639" end="01:20:26.320" style="s2">because it on a subtle level</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.400" end="01:20:30.080" style="s2">becomes inclusive enough to be both</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.320" end="01:20:32.080" style="s2">transcendent and and critical</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.080" end="01:20:33.760" style="s2">and all of those things but at the same</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:37.280" style="s2">time you can just walk past it</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:41.920" style="s2">if it&#39;s not your thing it won&#39;t register</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.280" end="01:20:41.920" style="s2">it won&#39;t i necessarily um</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.239" end="01:20:48.400" style="s2">you also i mean they hate</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.280" end="01:20:50.159" style="s2">i&#39;m not even sure let yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.400" end="01:20:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a difficult question you</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.159" end="01:20:54.639" style="s2">could also say like with wallace</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.480" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">uh like that they are the guy who wrote</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.639" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">infinite jest</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:21:00.000" style="s2">that um metamodern literature is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:01.920" style="s2">make some people very very</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.000" end="01:21:04.080" style="s2">happy and some people are very very sad</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.920" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">and angry and</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.080" end="01:21:07.600" style="s2">and you can imagine it that way as well</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.560" end="01:21:10.639" style="s2">right that</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.600" end="01:21:13.360" style="s2">you consciously or deliberately draw</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.639" end="01:21:14.960" style="s2">upon dialectical relationships or</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.360" end="01:21:16.800" style="s2">intuitively dummies doesn&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.960" end="01:21:21.199" style="s2">be consciously</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.800" end="01:21:24.400" style="s2">and and and you um</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.199" end="01:21:26.480" style="s2">and you piss some people off a lot right</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.400" end="01:21:28.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.480" end="01:21:29.760" style="s2">so anyway yeah you play with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.480" end="01:21:32.400" style="s2">sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.760" end="01:21:34.400" style="s2">towards the many that that&#39;s as far as i</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.400" end="01:21:35.520" style="s2">go you play with the sensitivity towards</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.400" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">the many</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.520" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">many memes</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.440" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">did you have any follow-up alexandria</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.120" end="01:21:48.560" style="s2">just a brief resonance like i</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:50.639" style="s2">i wonder whether meta modern art could</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.560" end="01:21:53.120" style="s2">death will never really be something</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.639" end="01:21:54.880" style="s2">fixed in time like it always has to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.120" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">in in movement somehow</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.880" end="01:22:00.960" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:01.840" style="s2">really risking to miss the point of</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.960" end="01:22:04.480" style="s2">wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.840" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">break people out of their conflict but</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.480" end="01:22:08.080" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:08.080" style="s2">just just that</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.199" end="01:22:15.590" style="s2">yeah uh maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.520" end="01:22:17.120" style="s2">um um</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.590" end="01:22:19.679" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.120" end="01:22:22.480" style="s2">yeah maybe i i mean at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.679" end="01:22:25.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.480" end="01:22:28.239" style="s2">it will probably make sense to to to</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.760" end="01:22:29.840" style="s2">uh in a hundred years look at a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.239" end="01:22:30.320" style="s2">things that happen in our culture today</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.840" end="01:22:32.639" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.320" end="01:22:33.440" style="s2">put in an art book next to the next to</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.639" end="01:22:36.239" style="s2">the other ones then</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.440" end="01:22:37.840" style="s2">and probably can be static in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.239" end="01:22:39.679" style="s2">but at the same time if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.840" end="01:22:43.600" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.679" end="01:22:45.600" style="s2">like renaissance paintings today and</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:47.040" style="s2">500 years ago obviously the thing has</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.600" end="01:22:49.199" style="s2">moved and this thing is going to move a</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.040" end="01:22:51.520" style="s2">lot more you look at post-modernity</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.199" end="01:22:52.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge difference between a</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.520" end="01:22:55.520" style="s2">futurist painting</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.960" end="01:22:56.800" style="s2">and the wall and nevertheless they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.520" end="01:22:59.199" style="s2">the same family</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.800" end="01:23:01.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s been on the move and then kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.199" end="01:23:02.960" style="s2">of stopped at a new world</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.360" end="01:23:04.840" style="s2">and then people are complaining that</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.960" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2">being complained about it got boring</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.840" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.920" end="01:23:12.080" style="s2">so daniel do you have time for one or</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:14.400" style="s2">two more questions yes i do actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.080" end="01:23:15.600" style="s2">i um i realized i didn&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.400" end="01:23:18.639" style="s2">to eating</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.600" end="01:23:21.199" style="s2">right after this great okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.639" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">so um travis had a question would you</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.199" end="01:23:24.960" style="s2">like to</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.840" end="01:23:27.679" style="s2">uh meet and ask yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.960" end="01:23:30.320" style="s2">uh when i was looking at them meta</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.679" end="01:23:33.360" style="s2">modernist examples i picked up on some</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.320" end="01:23:36.480" style="s2">transcendentalist vibes like</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.360" end="01:23:38.080" style="s2">emersonian or thoreauian</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.480" end="01:23:39.600" style="s2">if that&#39;s even the way that you would</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.080" end="01:23:43.199" style="s2">say that is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.600" end="01:23:44.960" style="s2">uh explicit is this kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.199" end="01:23:47.679" style="s2">are they picking up the thread of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.960" end="01:23:49.600" style="s2">naturalism of transcendentalist thinking</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.679" end="01:23:52.080" style="s2">and maybe trying to reconcile that with</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.600" end="01:23:55.040" style="s2">the pervasiveness of</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.080" end="01:23:56.239" style="s2">the man-made systems that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.040" end="01:23:59.360" style="s2">dominate the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.239" end="01:24:02.639" style="s2">post-modern world and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.360" end="01:24:06.080" style="s2">okay travis i&#39;ll just have to pass</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.639" end="01:24:08.159" style="s2">on that question because um hey i mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.080" end="01:24:09.520" style="s2">like i said i&#39;m really not an expert on</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.159" end="01:24:12.239" style="s2">the paintings themselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.520" end="01:24:12.560" style="s2">and but i&#39;m sure there is an answer to</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.239" end="01:24:15.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.560" end="01:24:18.400" style="s2">and my my gut feeling is yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.760" end="01:24:20.560" style="s2">there is definitely some emersonian</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.400" end="01:24:23.040" style="s2">tendencies in there and i also think</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.560" end="01:24:24.480" style="s2">generally speaking this american kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.040" end="01:24:27.840" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.480" end="01:24:32.400" style="s2">um and mysticism</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.840" end="01:24:34.080" style="s2">has a lot of proto and modern elements</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.400" end="01:24:36.320" style="s2">right because i mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.080" end="01:24:38.719" style="s2">connection to pragmatism</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.320" end="01:24:40.239" style="s2">to things on the move to taking up</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.719" end="01:24:43.679" style="s2">multiple perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.239" end="01:24:46.560" style="s2">to be you know in depth</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.679" end="01:24:48.480" style="s2">driven and spirituality driven uh and</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.560" end="01:24:52.800" style="s2">and go after profound</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.480" end="01:24:55.520" style="s2">expressions of existence without uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.800" end="01:24:57.600" style="s2">without teaching science and and so so</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.520" end="01:24:59.920" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.600" end="01:25:01.920" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s also a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:05.840" style="s2">reconnecting to earlier</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.920" end="01:25:09.679" style="s2">earlier meta memes and with with uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.840" end="01:25:13.360" style="s2">reconnecting to nature and so on um</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.679" end="01:25:16.560" style="s2">so yes i i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.360" end="01:25:17.199" style="s2">unmistakably there but if that&#39;s just if</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.560" end="01:25:20.719" style="s2">you ask</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.199" end="01:25:24.159" style="s2">me you&#39;re just saying yeah i we agree</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.719" end="01:25:25.520" style="s2">but uh asking some of the experts or the</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.159" end="01:25:26.400" style="s2">artists themselves they might actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:31.360" style="s2">have giving you</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.400" end="01:25:31.360" style="s2">another answer thanks</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.080" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">all right um paul had a question um that</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.639" end="01:25:37.199" style="s2">seems to reference</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:41.600" style="s2">uh what you were talking about a little</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.199" end="01:25:44.960" style="s2">earlier paul would you like to</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.600" end="01:25:46.960" style="s2">um hey daniel i&#39;d be curious as to</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.960" end="01:25:48.880" style="s2">um the relationship basically between</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.960" end="01:25:49.600" style="s2">the good true beautiful and in that</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.880" end="01:25:52.639" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.600" end="01:25:54.320" style="s2">you said that truth comes first so</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.639" end="01:25:56.960" style="s2">why beauty comes second kind of makes</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.320" end="01:25:58.800" style="s2">sense um but why not the good</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.960" end="01:26:00.880" style="s2">or what is the place for the good in</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.800" end="01:26:03.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.880" end="01:26:04.239" style="s2">actually yeah so so i figured it makes</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.760" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.239" end="01:26:09.840" style="s2">um to actually discuss about</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:10.719" style="s2">either truth uh either either good or</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.840" end="01:26:13.360" style="s2">justice as</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.719" end="01:26:14.800" style="s2">as a category i mean look at that</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.360" end="01:26:17.920" style="s2">plato&#39;s big four</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.800" end="01:26:17.920" style="s2">we do have that um</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.560" end="01:26:20.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.679" end="01:26:26.800" style="s2">the the good and the the true and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.719" end="01:26:29.199" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.800" end="01:26:30.320" style="s2">you can expand it into a four like</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.199" end="01:26:32.239" style="s2">wilbur</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.320" end="01:26:34.000" style="s2">has four quadrants for instance and then</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.239" end="01:26:34.880" style="s2">he never really names the fourth</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.000" end="01:26:38.320" style="s2">quadrant</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.880" end="01:26:40.400" style="s2">and in these terms but uh i mean you</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.320" end="01:26:45.199" style="s2">could you could also say</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.400" end="01:26:48.560" style="s2">uh the first person reality</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.199" end="01:26:51.760" style="s2">is has to do with beauty because</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.560" end="01:26:52.480" style="s2">no but because it&#39;s this transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.760" end="01:26:55.360" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.480" end="01:26:56.800" style="s2">nobody can take from you if you think</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.360" end="01:27:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s beautiful or</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.800" end="01:27:02.880" style="s2">or not a second person a</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.000" end="01:27:04.000" style="s2">second person is has to do with goodness</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.880" end="01:27:07.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.000" end="01:27:10.719" style="s2">justice because once you and i are there</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.280" end="01:27:12.800" style="s2">then then we can treat each other</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.719" end="01:27:14.159" style="s2">morally or not morally we can agree upon</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.800" end="01:27:16.480" style="s2">that there&#39;s a true</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.159" end="01:27:18.239" style="s2">value to that i guess in a sense and</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.480" end="01:27:19.760" style="s2">then there is objective truth value that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.239" end="01:27:20.639" style="s2">once you and i are there we can look at</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.760" end="01:27:23.040" style="s2">a third thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.639" end="01:27:24.080" style="s2">at an object or a third person and say</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.040" end="01:27:25.920" style="s2">this is a lion</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.080" end="01:27:28.400" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying no it&#39;s a pigeon and</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.920" end="01:27:30.400" style="s2">then we don&#39;t agree and then eventually</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.400" end="01:27:32.239" style="s2">we bring another person to the table</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.400" end="01:27:34.880" style="s2">three of us look and</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.239" end="01:27:37.040" style="s2">yeah and two people agree that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.880" end="01:27:39.120" style="s2">pigeon not alive for instance</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.040" end="01:27:40.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s third person reality and</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.120" end="01:27:43.280" style="s2">then you could expand it to fourth</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.960" end="01:27:46.560" style="s2">person reality which is the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.280" end="01:27:48.080" style="s2">or on the method we use to check if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.560" end="01:27:51.679" style="s2">a pigeon or</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.080" end="01:27:54.880" style="s2">so so we checked all all</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.679" end="01:27:56.880" style="s2">incumbents for pigeon bias and turns out</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.880" end="01:27:59.440" style="s2">you you had terrible pigeon bites</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.880" end="01:28:00.719" style="s2">and and then we can change the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.440" end="01:28:03.840" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.719" end="01:28:07.360" style="s2">so now we can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.840" end="01:28:09.440" style="s2">that the arts uh or the expression of</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.360" end="01:28:10.400" style="s2">human agency upon other objects which</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.440" end="01:28:13.520" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.400" end="01:28:17.280" style="s2">creative and destructive and have</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.520" end="01:28:20.159" style="s2">some aesthetic qualities to them that</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.280" end="01:28:20.960" style="s2">they can look to these different forms</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.159" end="01:28:22.560" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.960" end="01:28:26.080" style="s2">they can look at these different forms</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.560" end="01:28:29.520" style="s2">of of relatedness um to reality itself</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.080" end="01:28:31.920" style="s2">now given uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.520" end="01:28:34.000" style="s2">the entrance of post-modern art you</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.920" end="01:28:36.000" style="s2">enter into perspectivalism you enter</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.000" end="01:28:39.600" style="s2">into fourth person round</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.000" end="01:28:41.679" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just a modern</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.600" end="01:28:43.400" style="s2">sense of reality out there not just</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.679" end="01:28:44.480" style="s2">three dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.400" end="01:28:45.920" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.480" end="01:28:48.159" style="s2">picasso can squeeze a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.920" end="01:28:51.920" style="s2">dimensions and do the same thing right</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.159" end="01:28:52.480" style="s2">so uh looking at to get back to your</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.920" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.480" end="01:28:59.199" style="s2">uh more precisely what</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.000" end="01:29:03.520" style="s2">what the good is is</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.199" end="01:29:06.560" style="s2">um entirely actually</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.520" end="01:29:09.679" style="s2">it it can you can only know the good</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.560" end="01:29:11.600" style="s2">by knowing and what</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.679" end="01:29:13.280" style="s2">how you and i will treat each other once</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.600" end="01:29:16.719" style="s2">we have a relationship up</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.280" end="01:29:18.800" style="s2">now there&#39;s a the the good will be</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.719" end="01:29:20.639" style="s2">shaped by what you and i agree is</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.800" end="01:29:23.679" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.639" end="01:29:25.760" style="s2">so uh oftentimes different</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.679" end="01:29:27.040" style="s2">different ethics out there babbling in</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.760" end="01:29:29.040" style="s2">the world for</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.040" end="01:29:30.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t know capitalist ethics against</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.040" end="01:29:34.080" style="s2">communist ethics and so on</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.719" end="01:29:37.280" style="s2">will take on uh um</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.080" end="01:29:39.360" style="s2">an aesthetic side to them and</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.280" end="01:29:41.920" style="s2">for some people it just feels nice to</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.360" end="01:29:43.920" style="s2">think about animal rights it sounds cool</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.920" end="01:29:45.440" style="s2">for some people it just sounds boring</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.920" end="01:29:49.360" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.440" end="01:29:50.840" style="s2">a bit pantsy and those are aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.360" end="01:29:53.920" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.840" end="01:29:56.960" style="s2">so uh the the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.920" end="01:29:59.040" style="s2">good we generally get by working</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.960" end="01:30:00.400" style="s2">through the intersection of the true and</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.040" end="01:30:04.320" style="s2">the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.400" end="01:30:08.400" style="s2">and that we kind of have to travel</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.320" end="01:30:10.960" style="s2">up up those of that</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.400" end="01:30:11.600" style="s2">up that pyramid of abstraction or</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.960" end="01:30:13.440" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.600" end="01:30:14.960" style="s2">into the perspective then we go all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.440" end="01:30:17.360" style="s2">way back down</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.960" end="01:30:19.199" style="s2">so so on the way down to the to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.360" end="01:30:21.199" style="s2">beauty and where we recreate with ut</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.199" end="01:30:22.239" style="s2">once we have found new profound truths</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.199" end="01:30:25.120" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.239" end="01:30:26.239" style="s2">uh in a larger multiplicity of</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.120" end="01:30:28.880" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.239" end="01:30:30.080" style="s2">then we also on the way down figure out</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.880" end="01:30:34.080" style="s2">the ethics</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.080" end="01:30:37.280" style="s2">and the the point the only point is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.080" end="01:30:40.080" style="s2">a lot of people out there will find</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.280" end="01:30:42.239" style="s2">well i think this looks cool so then it</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:44.400" style="s2">is the good</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.239" end="01:30:45.520" style="s2">which is fine but it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.400" end="01:30:47.840" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.520" end="01:30:49.920" style="s2">how how the it should the good should</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.840" end="01:30:53.199" style="s2">ultimately be reduced</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.920" end="01:30:55.199" style="s2">uh because the good will be</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.199" end="01:30:56.960" style="s2">what is beautiful to you and me and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.199" end="01:30:59.760" style="s2">a compromise between those</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.960" end="01:31:01.360" style="s2">and if we compromise too far we can make</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.760" end="01:31:03.760" style="s2">a reality entirely black</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.360" end="01:31:05.360" style="s2">so we can&#39;t let the good or justice eat</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.760" end="01:31:08.400" style="s2">up all the beauty in the world</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.360" end="01:31:09.120" style="s2">because we&#39;ll end up being in concrete</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.400" end="01:31:11.600" style="s2">buildings</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.120" end="01:31:12.480" style="s2">with every penny we try to use on</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.600" end="01:31:14.080" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.480" end="01:31:16.560" style="s2">somebody will say wait a minute isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.080" end="01:31:19.679" style="s2">this better to use on medicine</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.560" end="01:31:21.600" style="s2">or whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.679" end="01:31:23.280" style="s2">and then we will live in a world devoid</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.600" end="01:31:26.480" style="s2">of beauty</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.280" end="01:31:29.600" style="s2">so somehow</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.480" end="01:31:31.120" style="s2">yeah yeah some somehow we have to go all</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.600" end="01:31:34.239" style="s2">the way up and all the way down</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.120" end="01:31:36.000" style="s2">through these and and reconnect</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.239" end="01:31:37.840" style="s2">back to beauty which is where life</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.000" end="01:31:39.280" style="s2">really happens it doesn&#39;t happen some</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.840" end="01:31:39.840" style="s2">perspective doesn&#39;t happen in truth</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.280" end="01:31:42.480" style="s2">seeking</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.840" end="01:31:43.520" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t happen even in ethics it just</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.480" end="01:31:48.080" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.520" end="01:31:50.000" style="s2">when there is an enjoyment um etc</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.080" end="01:31:51.920" style="s2">which is always a participatory</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.000" end="01:31:53.760" style="s2">enjoyment of of</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.920" end="01:31:55.360" style="s2">meeting the world which is an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.760" end="01:31:57.679" style="s2">experience and thus what art is</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.360" end="01:31:59.920" style="s2">ultimately about</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.679" end="01:32:03.280" style="s2">whether or not we want to use the modern</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.920" end="01:32:03.280" style="s2">category of art or not</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.800" end="01:32:08.880" style="s2">all right so there&#39;s one more question i</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.480" end="01:32:11.360" style="s2">thought might be nice to end us off with</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.880" end="01:32:12.880" style="s2">uh hopefully it&#39;s not opening anything</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.360" end="01:32:16.080" style="s2">too uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.880" end="01:32:17.360" style="s2">extensive here but um dan feldman you</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.080" end="01:32:19.679" style="s2">had a question about</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.360" end="01:32:19.679" style="s2">hope</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.880" end="01:32:25.520" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;m trying to recall i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.920" end="01:32:27.440" style="s2">see it in front of me at the moment i i</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.520" end="01:32:28.880" style="s2">guess my question with regard you said</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.440" end="01:32:33.360" style="s2">the new ecstatic</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.880" end="01:32:37.360" style="s2">uh daniel was based upon</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.360" end="01:32:40.480" style="s2">uh subtlety craftsmanship</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.360" end="01:32:42.320" style="s2">and i guess multi-perspectivalism as</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.480" end="01:32:46.800" style="s2">well as hope</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.320" end="01:32:49.920" style="s2">and i am questioning</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.800" end="01:32:54.400" style="s2">the value of hope um that perhaps that</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.920" end="01:32:56.880" style="s2">um brings in um</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.400" end="01:32:58.960" style="s2">it enters in that nihilism that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.880" end="01:33:00.560" style="s2">sit in the trouble long enough</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.960" end="01:33:02.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like give me that hope</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.560" end="01:33:05.440" style="s2">medicine quickly so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.480" end="01:33:07.360" style="s2">sit in the ruins and my own crap long</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.440" end="01:33:09.679" style="s2">enough that i can get through it</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.360" end="01:33:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of this deny it it feeds into</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.679" end="01:33:14.000" style="s2">this denialism</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.280" end="01:33:15.120" style="s2">that i it&#39;s gaslighting this narcissism</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.000" end="01:33:17.280" style="s2">that i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.120" end="01:33:19.199" style="s2">embedded in so i&#39;m i&#39;m very allergic to</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.280" end="01:33:20.480" style="s2">the concept that the art should have</p>

<p begin="01:33:24.800" end="01:33:28.159" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering what your uh sense of</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.679" end="01:33:30.320" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.159" end="01:33:31.440" style="s2">no so so i i would have to disagree on a</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.320" end="01:33:33.440" style="s2">fundamental uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.440" end="01:33:35.280" style="s2">behavioral level so if you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="01:33:46.960" end="01:33:52.080" style="s2">or it tasting well you know if</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.159" end="01:33:53.440" style="s2">if the hope level is literally brought</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.080" end="01:33:55.040" style="s2">to zero</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.440" end="01:33:57.920" style="s2">you won&#39;t be able to get yourself to eat</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.040" end="01:33:59.920" style="s2">breakfast it&#39;s i&#39;m just just</p>

<p begin="01:34:01.120" end="01:34:05.679" style="s2">or something it&#39;s just like if my hope</p>

<p begin="01:34:05.679" end="01:34:10.480" style="s2">you know giving this talk with and and</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.920" end="01:34:11.840" style="s2">so on was that like</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.480" end="01:34:13.360" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not going to get through with</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.840" end="01:34:13.679" style="s2">anything i&#39;m going to have anything to</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.360" end="01:34:16.159" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.679" end="01:34:17.520" style="s2">and etc right so i&#39;m just just on that</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.159" end="01:34:19.600" style="s2">visceral basic level</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.520" end="01:34:22.080" style="s2">we do need hope because we cannot act</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.600" end="01:34:26.480" style="s2">without in the world without we can</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.080" end="01:34:29.679" style="s2">if we with hope just mean expectation</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.480" end="01:34:32.960" style="s2">of outcome which is</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.679" end="01:34:34.800" style="s2">desirable right uh a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.960" end="01:34:38.400" style="s2">expectation of outcome</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.800" end="01:34:41.920" style="s2">uh so um um so so</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.400" end="01:34:43.280" style="s2">i mean today why do you think we do have</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.920" end="01:34:45.520" style="s2">a lack of hope</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.280" end="01:34:47.520" style="s2">and i see what you mean i see like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.520" end="01:34:49.679" style="s2">we also have a</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.520" end="01:34:51.119" style="s2">like a bunch of denial mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.679" end="01:34:53.760" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.119" end="01:34:54.800" style="s2">like i&#39;m not talking empirical i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.760" end="01:34:57.119" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.800" end="01:34:59.199" style="s2">uh we&#39;re gonna make it like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.119" end="01:35:03.280" style="s2">know if we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.199" end="01:35:05.920" style="s2">i it i&#39;m empirically not very hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.280" end="01:35:06.560" style="s2">right i&#39;m talking about spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.920" end="01:35:10.320" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.560" end="01:35:13.199" style="s2">that we have uh fuel enough</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.320" end="01:35:14.080" style="s2">like to lead not miserable lives and</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.199" end="01:35:16.159" style="s2">then still</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.080" end="01:35:17.679" style="s2">find awesome things to be doing together</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.159" end="01:35:20.880" style="s2">and be playful about it</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.679" end="01:35:24.639" style="s2">and kind of just you know act</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.880" end="01:35:25.679" style="s2">on something and i think silver punk is</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.639" end="01:35:28.159" style="s2">a good example there</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.679" end="01:35:29.199" style="s2">like i said okay i see what you mean</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.159" end="01:35:31.360" style="s2">because i also</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.199" end="01:35:32.320" style="s2">i also think there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.360" end="01:35:34.080" style="s2">hysteria and</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.320" end="01:35:36.639" style="s2">people have a level other critiques to</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.080" end="01:35:37.679" style="s2">it you know it&#39;s too gentrified to white</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.639" end="01:35:41.199" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.679" end="01:35:44.320" style="s2">um too glossy maybe but but</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.199" end="01:35:45.440" style="s2">uh but what i mean is uh like yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.320" end="01:35:48.000" style="s2">kill all hope with</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.440" end="01:35:49.199" style="s2">paddy warhol and then we make sure it</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.000" end="01:35:51.280" style="s2">says that</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.199" end="01:35:52.320" style="s2">but once we&#39;ve killed all hope what do</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.280" end="01:35:54.400" style="s2">we do well</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.320" end="01:35:55.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing with god we will get</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.400" end="01:35:58.159" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.360" end="01:35:59.760" style="s2">if you join a later talk on the fourth</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.159" end="01:36:03.440" style="s2">talk in this series</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.760" end="01:36:05.840" style="s2">uh like once you&#39;ve killed god like</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.440" end="01:36:07.840" style="s2">what&#39;s left to do well you resurrect him</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.840" end="01:36:10.400" style="s2">or her with it or i am</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.840" end="01:36:10.880" style="s2">um and it always comes back on the third</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.400" end="01:36:12.560" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.880" end="01:36:15.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of like that after</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.560" end="01:36:17.199" style="s2">deconstruction right and we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.119" end="01:36:18.600" style="s2">ruthless deconstruction we&#39;re gonna pick</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.199" end="01:36:21.600" style="s2">this world apart</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.600" end="01:36:22.719" style="s2">ruthlessly and pick ourselves apart</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.600" end="01:36:25.280" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be painful it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.719" end="01:36:28.800" style="s2">awful and it already is awful</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.280" end="01:36:31.600" style="s2">but what do you do afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.800" end="01:36:32.239" style="s2">when everything is disenchanted like</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.600" end="01:36:34.719" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.239" end="01:36:36.000" style="s2">once we&#39;ve really done our homework well</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.719" end="01:36:38.880" style="s2">then i think we</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.000" end="01:36:39.440" style="s2">deserve some hope and then i think we</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.880" end="01:36:42.400" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.440" end="01:36:43.199" style="s2">come up with a most often art project we</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.400" end="01:36:46.320" style="s2">can think of</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.199" end="01:36:49.119" style="s2">which means just pure uh creation of</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.320" end="01:36:50.960" style="s2">cool and and find the highest possible</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.119" end="01:36:53.119" style="s2">truth that can follow and then try to</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.960" end="01:36:55.440" style="s2">work together to make it happen</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.119" end="01:36:56.400" style="s2">um and you know basically coming out of</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.440" end="01:36:58.880" style="s2">the box like</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.400" end="01:37:00.159" style="s2">the thing on the screen that is today of</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.880" end="01:37:04.840" style="s2">fantasy will be real</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.159" end="01:37:06.880" style="s2">here in the world that&#39;s hope or like</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.840" end="01:37:10.080" style="s2">well we get</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.880" end="01:37:12.080" style="s2">close to uh fiction but the fiction gets</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.080" end="01:37:13.119" style="s2">the closer we get to it the more it</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.080" end="01:37:15.280" style="s2">becomes real</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.119" end="01:37:16.320" style="s2">and then it&#39;s no longer fiction and then</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.280" end="01:37:19.440" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.320" end="01:37:22.239" style="s2">over uh overturns fiction</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.440" end="01:37:23.280" style="s2">and and and it becomes more fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.239" end="01:37:26.080" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.280" end="01:37:27.840" style="s2">route always surprises us it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.080" end="01:37:29.679" style="s2">more horrible than we imagined</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.840" end="01:37:31.280" style="s2">and then it&#39;s always more fantastic than</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.679" end="01:37:34.719" style="s2">we imagined right</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.280" end="01:37:37.119" style="s2">um yeah i mean i i guess</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.719" end="01:37:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not a rational argument to get to</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.119" end="01:37:40.159" style="s2">give back i mean the first part may be</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.800" end="01:37:42.400" style="s2">about behavior</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.159" end="01:37:44.159" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s it&#39;s just uh i guess</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.400" end="01:37:47.440" style="s2">people have different</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.159" end="01:37:48.480" style="s2">religious ground settings here and i</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.440" end="01:37:50.880" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.480" end="01:37:52.080" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s nothing to argue about</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.880" end="01:37:54.800" style="s2">really it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.080" end="01:37:56.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just the thing that yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.800" end="01:38:00.000" style="s2">gonna have different</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.400" end="01:38:00.000" style="s2">basic feelings about this right</p>
