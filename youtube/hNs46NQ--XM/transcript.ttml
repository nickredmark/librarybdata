<p begin="00:02:01.640" end="00:02:06.260" style="s2">idea cafe this was going to be a video</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.400" end="00:02:07.940" style="s2">on the sharing economy I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.260" end="00:02:09.560" style="s2">answer a question but I think this will</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.940" end="00:02:11.150" style="s2">be two different videos hence the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.560" end="00:02:13.220" style="s2">than one video a day which I felt like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.150" end="00:02:15.050" style="s2">was limiting myself and pushing it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.220" end="00:02:16.250" style="s2">forward too much on the days when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.050" end="00:02:17.900" style="s2">would just come on and be like well I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.250" end="00:02:19.880" style="s2">gotta do a video today and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.900" end="00:02:21.590" style="s2">exactly what I needed in the moment but</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.880" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">now that I&#39;ve come across game B and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.590" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">that community and now that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:29.450" style="s2">cafe has started I feel like my focus</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">needs to be elsewhere from forcing</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.450" end="00:02:34.130" style="s2">myself to do daily videos so that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:37.100" style="s2">what this update is is what this channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.130" end="00:02:41.450" style="s2">is is evolving into and I will be back</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.100" end="00:02:42.590" style="s2">on what they&#39;ll be doing today I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.450" end="00:02:45.500" style="s2">can&#39;t see I&#39;ll see you tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:47.690" style="s2">but a better world is on its way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.500" end="00:02:51.050" style="s2">gonna be brought to you by our diversity</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.690" end="00:02:53.690" style="s2">and you get to watch it unfold</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.050" end="00:02:56.300" style="s2">maybe not live on YouTube but definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.690" end="00:03:00.010" style="s2">on YouTube as long as they don&#39;t kick me</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.300" end="00:03:00.010" style="s2">off take care</p>
