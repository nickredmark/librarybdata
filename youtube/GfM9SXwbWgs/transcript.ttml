<p begin="00:00:04.670" end="00:00:11.309" style="s2">so this is the first rebel wisdom Q&amp;A we</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.970" end="00:00:13.530" style="s2">announced earlier in the week and asked</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.309" end="00:00:15.960" style="s2">you guys to put your questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.530" end="00:00:17.539" style="s2">underneath the video and then to vote up</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">the questions that you wanted answered</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.539" end="00:00:21.480" style="s2">so what we&#39;ve discovered is that our</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">audience is far smarter than us and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.480" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">they&#39;ve asked us questions that we maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to answer but we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:30.439" style="s2">what we can so we&#39;re basically going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">time this and it will be an hour and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.439" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">we&#39;ll answer definitely answer the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:40.890" style="s2">12 questions and then we&#39;ll start going</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:42.390" style="s2">down below that and work out depending</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.890" end="00:00:44.010" style="s2">on how much time we&#39;ve got that will</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.390" end="00:00:51.050" style="s2">decide how many questions have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.010" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">asked to answer so first and so the 12</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.050" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">top questions we&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:56.489" style="s2">going to answer them the order that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:58.440" style="s2">were that they&#39;re they were ranked but</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.489" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">we&#39;re going to answer all all 12 of them</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">and starting with the ones that we know</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">that we can answer moving on to the ones</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">that we&#39;re really struggling with you</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2">can&#39;t decide yourselves when that moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">comes hmm so Allie why do you use the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">Black Sun as a logo what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">you cuz it looks cool Cleo the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">thing to say it&#39;s not the place it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:26.909" style="s2">a Black Sun or no Sun it&#39;s the eye and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:29.490" style="s2">the triangle yes exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.909" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">and for me the eye represents the I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.490" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">guess the transformative power of true</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">knowledge inner knowledge truth in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">general and yeah it&#39;s so combined it has</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">that sense for me and I know what are</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">your feelings on our logo I so from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">beginning when we were trying to put the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:54.450" style="s2">logo together the idea was I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">listening to a lot of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.450" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">stuff at the time and the idea of the it</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">was the eye and the pyramid the pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">or the the triangle being truth logos</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">the dominance hierarchy all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:08.190" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">and the eye meaning awareness and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.190" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">eye there&#39;s actually a little clip that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:12.380" style="s2">I might dig out and see if we can play</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:13.880" style="s2">where I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.380" end="00:02:15.320" style="s2">the logo - Jordan Peterson during my</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.880" end="00:02:17.210" style="s2">first interview and he was like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.320" end="00:02:21.170" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect you&#39;ve got it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.210" end="00:02:24.770" style="s2">it&#39;s the eye it&#39;s the awareness but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.170" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">the eye and the Sun in the pyramid that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.770" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2">you worship not the pyramid itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:31.370" style="s2">the regenerating factor that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:33.170" style="s2">awareness is consciousness effectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.370" end="00:02:35.420" style="s2">it&#39;s the consciousness that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:37.070" style="s2">then able to update the structure that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.420" end="00:02:38.660" style="s2">we should be worshipping not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.070" end="00:02:40.580" style="s2">destructor itself don&#39;t know if you saw</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.660" end="00:02:46.430" style="s2">the logo that we&#39;ve put together forever</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.580" end="00:02:49.160" style="s2">wisdom and recognize the eye and yep and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.430" end="00:02:50.690" style="s2">the triangle yeah perfect we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.160" end="00:02:52.850" style="s2">looking for an abstract kind of way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.690" end="00:02:54.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t look too Illuminati there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.850" end="00:02:56.570" style="s2">little bit Illuminati but not quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.200" end="00:03:00.590" style="s2">right so much yeah well that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.570" end="00:03:02.890" style="s2">is that it&#39;s the it&#39;s the Sun in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.590" end="00:03:06.350" style="s2">pyramid that you worship not the pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.890" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">right because the Sun is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.350" end="00:03:17.090" style="s2">in both senses that stops it from being</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:19.010" style="s2">the patriarchy so that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.090" end="00:03:20.750" style="s2">you can have a relationship with that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.010" end="00:03:23.390" style="s2">transcends the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.750" end="00:03:25.400" style="s2">itself yeah it is it is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.390" end="00:03:27.980" style="s2">it like in the Lion King that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.400" end="00:03:30.440" style="s2">that little bird Zazu well he flies</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.980" end="00:03:32.420" style="s2">above everything sees everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.440" end="00:03:35.210" style="s2">the eye that&#39;s the Egyptian eye it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.420" end="00:03:36.800" style="s2">outside the structure it&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.210" end="00:03:38.300" style="s2">that moves up and down the structure and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.800" end="00:03:41.240" style="s2">it repairs it that&#39;s what consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.300" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">does in your body it&#39;s it moves up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.240" end="00:03:48.050" style="s2">down levels of of reality let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.900" end="00:03:50.180" style="s2">and alters them so in it&#39;s so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.050" end="00:03:51.770" style="s2">outside the structure and it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.180" end="00:03:53.960" style="s2">thing that gives rise to the structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.770" end="00:03:56.090" style="s2">but the structure also gives rise to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.960" end="00:03:58.010" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s Trinitarian ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.090" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">Christianity you know there&#39;s the father</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.010" end="00:04:02.510" style="s2">and the son and they&#39;re mutually causal</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:04.460" style="s2">think well how can that be well the son</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.510" end="00:04:07.910" style="s2">gives birth to the father obviously</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.460" end="00:04:09.800" style="s2">because boys turn into men but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.910" end="00:04:12.650" style="s2">father also gives birth to the son and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.800" end="00:04:15.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of the reason that those</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.650" end="00:04:17.210" style="s2">Trinitarian ideas exist yeah when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.320" end="00:04:20.030" style="s2">were putting the logo together the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.210" end="00:04:21.770" style="s2">kind of brief that we were kind of clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.030" end="00:04:23.270" style="s2">on is it can&#39;t look too Illuminati</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.770" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">because obviously you&#39;re starting as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.270" end="00:04:26.460" style="s2">start to the pyramids and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:28.590" style="s2">getting into kind of the dollar bill</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.460" end="00:04:31.620" style="s2">territory in your life okay it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:33.510" style="s2">Illuminati and the head and he actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.620" end="00:04:35.370" style="s2">got it done and it was like yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.510" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">looks perfect it&#39;s great I&#39;m one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.370" end="00:04:42.540" style="s2">first comments workers why why is your</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:45.540" style="s2">logo there but my favorite comment ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.540" end="00:04:47.490" style="s2">or no in our films is what was it it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.540" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">salute your logo is Illuminati as</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.490" end="00:04:52.890" style="s2">but you seem legit which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:04:55.110" style="s2">about as good as it gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.890" end="00:04:56.730" style="s2">yeah really yeah I really love that idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.110" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">I&#39;m just think remembering something</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.730" end="00:05:00.090" style="s2">that was actually involve under clays</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:02.220" style="s2">sermon but don&#39;t think we&#39;ve put out</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">this particular bit of it that really</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.220" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">stuck with me</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:08.940" style="s2">the whole idea of being able to step out</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">of the structure of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.940" end="00:05:12.570" style="s2">whatever it is and regenerate it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">have a different perspective on it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.570" end="00:05:17.040" style="s2">really it&#39;s a really deep idea you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:19.560" style="s2">he talked about Jesus washing the feet</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.040" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">of the disciples of his disciples and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.560" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">that being a an action that kind of took</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:27.450" style="s2">him or could have inverted everything on</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:29.450" style="s2">his head and took him out of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.450" end="00:05:32.550" style="s2">dominance hierarchy game altogether</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.450" end="00:05:33.900" style="s2">really interesting and there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.550" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">top becomes the bottom and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.900" end="00:05:37.380" style="s2">kind of regeneration of the structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:39.480" style="s2">exactly yeah and then there&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.380" end="00:05:41.190" style="s2">very famous alchemical image called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.480" end="00:05:42.300" style="s2">I really hope I pronounced it right but</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.190" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">we can we can probably put it up on</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.300" end="00:05:46.590" style="s2">screen the telling me Ron tell a Marion</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:48.420" style="s2">I think with a lot of people will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.590" end="00:05:50.760" style="s2">aware of it it&#39;s the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.420" end="00:05:52.860" style="s2">initiate climbing through one sphere</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.760" end="00:05:54.540" style="s2">into the heavens if you neutral I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.860" end="00:05:56.730" style="s2">talking about they&#39;re kind of on there</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.540" end="00:05:58.670" style="s2">yeah we can put it up though but I love</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.730" end="00:06:01.710" style="s2">that kind of alchemical idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.670" end="00:06:03.810" style="s2">knowledge in general can give us a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.710" end="00:06:06.920" style="s2">completely new perspective on reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.810" end="00:06:11.010" style="s2">and for me the logo holds some of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.920" end="00:06:14.760" style="s2">kind of symbolism in it as well go so</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.010" end="00:06:16.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the story the logo so question</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.760" end="00:06:18.930" style="s2">two questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.140" end="00:06:20.130" style="s2">yeah so question two is from sorry so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">question one by the way was from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.130" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">dashing rogue question two is from and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">I&#39;m going to try and pronounce this</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:30.840" style="s2">correctly apologies it was wrong land be</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.550" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">art so what do you to see as the Telos</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.840" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">or end of all this Peterson slash</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:38.360" style="s2">intellectual dark web stuff what is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.979" style="s2">goal to ultimately justify and direct</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.360" end="00:06:43.069" style="s2">this collective intellectual endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.979" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">hmm great question it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.069" end="00:06:47.330" style="s2">because I think a lot of people involved</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:49.130" style="s2">in this conversation probably have</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.330" end="00:06:57.530" style="s2">different ideas about what the end goal</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.130" end="00:07:00.289" style="s2">is I think Peterson I mean the end it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.530" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">like at the moment the ID w&#39;s end goal</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.289" end="00:07:04.910" style="s2">or the the goal right now for the idea W</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">is to carve out a space to have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.910" end="00:07:12.199" style="s2">conversation where it goes from there I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:14.060" style="s2">think different members of the IDW have</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.199" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">different concepts of where it goes from</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.060" end="00:07:25.069" style="s2">there and I think that there is a hope</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:27.110" style="s2">yeah they do hope that it can that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.069" end="00:07:32.210" style="s2">having that conversation can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.110" end="00:07:35.870" style="s2">find the solutions that will what would</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.210" end="00:07:37.400" style="s2">you say kind of change society or deal</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.870" end="00:07:38.719" style="s2">with deal with the essential threats</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.400" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">that we&#39;re dealing with I mean they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.719" end="00:07:42.680" style="s2">got very big ideas definitely yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:43.699" style="s2">especially look like specially I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.680" end="00:07:45.530" style="s2">thinking the Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.699" end="00:07:47.210" style="s2">yeah ticular yeah Weinstein and Bret</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.530" end="00:07:51.620" style="s2">Weinstein they do they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.210" end="00:07:55.219" style="s2">holding one of the the most farsighted</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.620" end="00:07:56.780" style="s2">pieces in the IDW yeah I think Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.219" end="00:07:58.840" style="s2">has a slightly different focus he&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.780" end="00:08:01.880" style="s2">more focused on the individual and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.840" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">the transformative power of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.880" end="00:08:08.659" style="s2">your true alignment yet then as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:12.190" style="s2">priority and then that itself becomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.659" end="00:08:13.849" style="s2">the he sees that as the main seat of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.190" end="00:08:16.460" style="s2">transformation rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.849" end="00:08:18.979" style="s2">structural in that yeah and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.460" end="00:08:20.870" style="s2">not entirely clear on his kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.979" end="00:08:23.150" style="s2">relationship between that and that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.870" end="00:08:25.370" style="s2">the widest structures of society yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.150" end="00:08:28.599" style="s2">I&#39;m not entirely sure either on that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.370" end="00:08:31.819" style="s2">point yeah I agree with you I think one</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.599" end="00:08:33.469" style="s2">aspect of it is definitely that the kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.819" end="00:08:37.130" style="s2">of conversation that is happening now in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.469" end="00:08:37.969" style="s2">the IDW gets integrated into the wider I</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.130" end="00:08:40.669" style="s2">guess into lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.969" end="00:08:42.469" style="s2">institutions that are you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.669" end="00:08:43.940" style="s2">something arguably that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.469" end="00:08:47.080" style="s2">for us to be able to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.940" end="00:08:48.580" style="s2">effectively so in that sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.080" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">I hope what in a sense maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.580" end="00:08:53.230" style="s2">happening already or the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:55.720" style="s2">it are personally I mean in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.230" end="00:08:57.910" style="s2">question of where&#39;s the end of it I</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.720" end="00:09:01.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know I have no idea where I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.910" end="00:09:06.280" style="s2">like it to go is to quite is to open the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.630" end="00:09:07.720" style="s2">space for a more integral way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.280" end="00:09:09.670" style="s2">the world so that&#39;s something for</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.720" end="00:09:12.340" style="s2">example like sam Harris Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.670" end="00:09:16.840" style="s2">though it&#39;s not one winning its that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.340" end="00:09:19.540" style="s2">both it&#39;s holding a kind of resolution</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.840" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">that allows for different aspects that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.540" end="00:09:23.050" style="s2">allows for the material that allows for</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.130" end="00:09:26.110" style="s2">the spiritual that allows for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.050" end="00:09:27.460" style="s2">biological and the artistic and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.110" end="00:09:29.140" style="s2">you know for me that&#39;s what the great</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.460" end="00:09:31.390" style="s2">intellectual awakening is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.140" end="00:09:33.780" style="s2">creating a space that is less polarized</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.390" end="00:09:37.990" style="s2">not just politically but also in our our</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.780" end="00:09:41.410" style="s2">values of yeah what we value is good</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.990" end="00:09:43.080" style="s2">thinking in a sense I mean it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.410" end="00:09:46.450" style="s2">interesting question as well because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.080" end="00:09:50.260" style="s2">have a sense of where I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.450" end="00:09:52.570" style="s2">intellectual integration would go and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.260" end="00:09:53.950" style="s2">also a sense of that actually it needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.570" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">to be more than intellectual integration</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.950" end="00:09:57.940" style="s2">it needs to incorporate sort of the more</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:10:02.140" style="s2">embodied forms of knowing the more</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.940" end="00:10:03.700" style="s2">transformational spaces so and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.140" end="00:10:05.770" style="s2">not sure whether I&#39;m projecting that on</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.700" end="00:10:08.230" style="s2">to the IDW conversation like assuming</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.770" end="00:10:09.400" style="s2">that they would also share a similar</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.230" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">idea because I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.400" end="00:10:17.830" style="s2">necessarily do but I see that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:19.270" style="s2">great quote that begins a book the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.830" end="00:10:21.880" style="s2">epilogue of passion of the Western mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.270" end="00:10:26.650" style="s2">by Richert Arnaz brought by Robert</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.880" end="00:10:28.960" style="s2">Bellah and he talks about we may be seen</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.650" end="00:10:32.500" style="s2">in the paraphrase and maybe I can put it</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.960" end="00:10:35.350" style="s2">up on mine up on screen but something</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.500" end="00:10:36.910" style="s2">like we may be seeing the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.350" end="00:10:39.970" style="s2">a reintegration of consciousness it will</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.910" end="00:10:42.070" style="s2">not be based on any single unit univocal</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.970" end="00:10:44.500" style="s2">understanding of reality it&#39;ll recognize</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.070" end="00:10:48.070" style="s2">that we have to ship between different</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.500" end="00:10:50.230" style="s2">imaginative vocabularies and that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.070" end="00:10:52.960" style="s2">have a propensity to fit to slip into</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.230" end="00:10:54.760" style="s2">one literal interpretation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.960" end="00:10:58.540" style="s2">so we need to be eternally alert to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.760" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">so it&#39;s this sense that Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.540" end="00:11:03.910" style="s2">Jungian map work</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:06.100" style="s2">yeah Brett&#39;s evolutionary map works they</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.910" end="00:11:10.360" style="s2">map onto each other they reconcile like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.100" end="00:11:12.190" style="s2">lots of different people in the IDW have</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.360" end="00:11:13.690" style="s2">different parts of the puzzle I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.190" end="00:11:16.810" style="s2">think that&#39;s probably a few other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.690" end="00:11:18.850" style="s2">who are not considered part of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.810" end="00:11:21.070" style="s2">at the moment that probably if that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:23.140" style="s2">the nature of the conversation will have</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.070" end="00:11:26.230" style="s2">to come into it at some point kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.140" end="00:11:28.779" style="s2">future like I think for example Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.230" end="00:11:29.769" style="s2">wheel we didn&#39;t interview with I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.779" end="00:11:33.339" style="s2">is still one of the best interviews</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.769" end="00:11:35.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve done is holding such an important</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.339" end="00:11:38.110" style="s2">piece of what that what the embody</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.610" end="00:11:42.670" style="s2">transformational work that we would have</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.110" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">to do to be able to yeah ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.670" end="00:11:47.740" style="s2">one we&#39;re stuck and not seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:49.329" style="s2">from another person&#39;s perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.740" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not able to understand all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.329" end="00:11:53.410" style="s2">some kind of block often it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re holding on to something at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:11:59.829" style="s2">deeper level like a psycho like this you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:12:01.450" style="s2">know some belief or some yeah childhood</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.829" end="00:12:04.870" style="s2">conditioning or something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.450" end="00:12:06.670" style="s2">like and and that ultimately like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.870" end="00:12:09.970" style="s2">the only genuine reconciliation I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.670" end="00:12:13.240" style="s2">see is when we&#39;re bringing in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.970" end="00:12:14.380" style="s2">person or when bringing in yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.240" end="00:12:15.550" style="s2">bringing in to the other levels of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.380" end="00:12:19.480" style="s2">knowledge as well as just the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.550" end="00:12:21.220" style="s2">intellectual yeah I&#39;m also just closing</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.480" end="00:12:23.529" style="s2">on that point I&#39;m gonna slightly</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.220" end="00:12:28.440" style="s2">contradict myself from earlier because</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.529" end="00:12:30.760" style="s2">yeah the I think it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.440" end="00:12:33.670" style="s2">reenactment of the world is this a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.760" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">phrase that kind of used sometimes about</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.670" end="00:12:38.680" style="s2">bringing a meaning back into the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:39.910" style="s2">so at the same time as holding a more</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.680" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">integral perspective so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.910" end="00:12:43.750" style="s2">necessarily that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:44.770" style="s2">equivalency of like everything has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.750" end="00:12:46.180" style="s2">piece of the puzzle that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.770" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">necessarily true I think truth is still</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.180" end="00:12:49.720" style="s2">the kind of thing that determines the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:51.730" style="s2">direction and we&#39;re all the maps</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.720" end="00:12:56.769" style="s2">converge so I just wanted to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.730" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2">that and yeah that is there&#39;s also you</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.769" end="00:13:00.100" style="s2">know what you were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:02.500" style="s2">being able to hold different</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.100" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">perspectives at the same time that feels</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.500" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">that feels absolutely essential and for</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.800" end="00:13:26.449" style="s2">cool okay Ally I would love this is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:29.059" style="s2">question is from Adele Sumi adults are</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.449" end="00:13:30.740" style="s2">summe I would like to hear what pieces</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.059" end="00:13:33.829" style="s2">of art you regard as a highest human</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.740" end="00:13:36.170" style="s2">achievement that you know of no no</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.829" end="00:13:38.449" style="s2">messing around in category of raising</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.170" end="00:13:39.769" style="s2">oneself closer to God and your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.449" end="00:13:41.509" style="s2">on music and your perspective on its</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.769" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">effects on consciousness individual and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.509" end="00:13:48.319" style="s2">social so it&#39;s for a bit cheeky it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:51.110" style="s2">it&#39;s meaty I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna be a bit cheeky</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.319" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">and not answer it with one particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.110" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">piece of art because I tried I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:14:01.430" style="s2">sat there and thought I&#39;m a lot more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:02.930" style="s2">not so into visual art I can really</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.430" end="00:14:05.540" style="s2">appreciate it but for me there are that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.930" end="00:14:08.269" style="s2">really that I really connect with tends</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.540" end="00:14:11.329" style="s2">to be literature and music so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.269" end="00:14:12.439" style="s2">blend a few things together so pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.329" end="00:14:13.699" style="s2">art you regard as a highest human</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.439" end="00:14:15.050" style="s2">achievement then you know all that in</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.699" end="00:14:19.129" style="s2">the category of raising one&#39;s self</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.050" end="00:14:22.490" style="s2">closer to God so I think music has that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.129" end="00:14:24.259" style="s2">power maybe more than and it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.490" end="00:14:26.360" style="s2">different for every person but for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.259" end="00:14:30.319" style="s2">more than most other art forms music has</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.360" end="00:14:33.410" style="s2">this especially music song live or song</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.319" end="00:14:35.449" style="s2">all together or play together so I play</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.410" end="00:14:37.129" style="s2">traditional Irish music I can pubs and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.449" end="00:14:39.500" style="s2">even that I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.129" end="00:14:42.410" style="s2">deep mystical experience but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.500" end="00:14:45.559" style="s2">a beautiful flow state so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.410" end="00:14:47.149" style="s2">like music really yeah really gets me</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.559" end="00:14:48.439" style="s2">into a state of flow and I think most</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.149" end="00:14:50.809" style="s2">people especially in a really good</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.439" end="00:14:53.059" style="s2">concert or gig or whatever it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.809" end="00:14:54.290" style="s2">why you know actually Jamie real talks</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.059" end="00:14:56.329" style="s2">about that I&#39;m stealing fire it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.290" end="00:14:58.129" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons we really love</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.329" end="00:15:01.550" style="s2">music you know it gets us into that into</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.129" end="00:15:06.379" style="s2">that space I&#39;m also big fan of visionary</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.550" end="00:15:07.819" style="s2">art so art that&#39;s created based on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.379" end="00:15:10.009" style="s2">visionary experience which might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.819" end="00:15:11.870" style="s2">drug-induced it might be you know some</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.009" end="00:15:16.189" style="s2">people do from lucid dreams it can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.870" end="00:15:18.019" style="s2">all sorts I think that&#39;s really profound</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.189" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">and powerful because that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.019" end="00:15:21.439" style="s2">directly from an altered space and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:24.259" style="s2">kind of made with that space in mind I</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.439" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">think art is I&#39;ve always been really</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.259" end="00:15:28.040" style="s2">interested in the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:30.620" style="s2">art as a drug and how can art become and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.040" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">is in some way a drug in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.620" end="00:15:35.900" style="s2">that it actually puts you in a different</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2">state and I find that concept about art</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.900" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">in general I think any art that manages</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:40.730" style="s2">to do that and people have that</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:43.460" style="s2">experience looking at Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.730" end="00:15:45.410" style="s2">paintings as well you know so I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.460" end="00:15:47.480" style="s2">that&#39;s when it&#39;s that&#39;s when it plays</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.410" end="00:15:49.490" style="s2">that role of getting us in your words</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.480" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">you know closer to God or closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.490" end="00:15:54.260" style="s2">transcendent or whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:57.500" style="s2">call it so yeah that&#39;s my scattered</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.260" end="00:16:00.710" style="s2">thinking on that very deep question your</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.500" end="00:16:05.570" style="s2">thoughts I&#39;m gonna just throw a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.710" end="00:16:07.250" style="s2">curveball in and say that what I find</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.570" end="00:16:10.910" style="s2">myself spending most of my time</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.250" end="00:16:12.850" style="s2">listening to and I I i also think music</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.910" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">this there&#39;s something about music that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.850" end="00:16:19.390" style="s2">is it also fits with what peterson talks</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:21.470" style="s2">about that out that meaning is a primary</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.390" end="00:16:22.610" style="s2">sanitation yeah well meaning is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.470" end="00:16:23.870" style="s2">something that happens secondarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.610" end="00:16:27.770" style="s2">meaning or something that there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.870" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">very prime at primary yeah and music i</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.770" end="00:16:31.820" style="s2">think speaks to that because it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:34.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a believe oak meaning and it but</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.820" end="00:16:35.900" style="s2">able to evoke emotion was reliably and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.760" end="00:16:38.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like why does it poke those</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.900" end="00:16:42.020" style="s2">emotions it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s somehow tapping</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.180" end="00:16:44.810" style="s2">quite directly into yeah in time meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.020" end="00:16:47.420" style="s2">systems some of the curveball i was</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.810" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">going to throw in is that I&#39;m a massive</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.420" end="00:16:55.700" style="s2">fan of rap and I love I love the fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:57.560" style="s2">that it is there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.700" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">way it just ties everything together</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.560" end="00:17:01.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the port the thing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:04.220" style="s2">often rapping about is more and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.420" end="00:17:05.990" style="s2">lyrically dextrous ways of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.220" end="00:17:07.850" style="s2">how in the flow in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.990" end="00:17:09.080" style="s2">moment they are like it&#39;s very self</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.850" end="00:17:11.900" style="s2">referential but they&#39;re I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.080" end="00:17:15.230" style="s2">performative and the best rap really</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.900" end="00:17:18.680" style="s2">conscious really self-aware really kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.230" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">of just in that state of flow I find</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.680" end="00:17:26.750" style="s2">just really powerful I love it and of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:29.060" style="s2">the best piece of art that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.750" end="00:17:32.150" style="s2">most impressed with the pieces of art</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.060" end="00:17:33.680" style="s2">that we&#39;re most impressed with over the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.150" end="00:17:37.539" style="s2">last couple of years probably Kendrick</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.680" end="00:17:40.570" style="s2">Lamar&#39;s good kid maad city and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.539" end="00:17:41.859" style="s2">to pimp a butterfly I wasn&#39;t as taken</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.570" end="00:17:45.970" style="s2">with damn although he kind of won a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.859" end="00:17:49.090" style="s2">more Awards for that but in good kid</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.970" end="00:17:51.100" style="s2">maad city in particular there is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.090" end="00:17:53.379" style="s2">got the depth of a novel it&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.100" end="00:17:57.399" style="s2">depth of a characterization and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.379" end="00:17:59.169" style="s2">metaphors the way that it refers it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.399" end="00:18:01.419" style="s2">basically about one day and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.169" end="00:18:04.809" style="s2">continually refers back to itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.419" end="00:18:08.950" style="s2">an absolute masterpiece and I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.809" end="00:18:10.869" style="s2">obsessed as you&#39;re probably very like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.950" end="00:18:12.220" style="s2">couple years ago it&#39;s like obsessed with</p>

<p begin="00:18:17.470" end="00:18:22.359" style="s2">novel in musical form and I feel a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.859" end="00:18:24.489" style="s2">little bit vindicated like people were</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.359" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">just saying to us with kind of the model</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.489" end="00:18:31.479" style="s2">and he want to pull that he&#39;s now won a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:34.299" style="s2">Pulitzer for yeah for the his work and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.479" end="00:18:35.470" style="s2">that I&#39;m like yeah I&#39;m glad that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.299" end="00:18:37.029" style="s2">getting that kind of recognition I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.470" end="00:18:39.999" style="s2">glad people are actually realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.029" end="00:18:43.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an incredible lyrical</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.999" end="00:18:47.889" style="s2">storyteller there and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.450" end="00:18:52.149" style="s2">see many other artists on that level at</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.889" end="00:18:55.929" style="s2">the moment doing what he&#39;s doing but</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.149" end="00:18:58.229" style="s2">yeah oh oh yeah I won&#39;t say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.929" end="00:19:04.649" style="s2">highest human achievement I know of but</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.229" end="00:19:08.019" style="s2">that&#39;s good yeah five and Julian what</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.649" end="00:19:10.029" style="s2">says I&#39;m wondering how you distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.019" end="00:19:11.470" style="s2">your and presumably Peterson&#39;s position</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.029" end="00:19:13.659" style="s2">on religion from people like Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.470" end="00:19:15.820" style="s2">on one hand and people like pull them to</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.659" end="00:19:17.049" style="s2">clay on the other I assume you&#39;d agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.820" end="00:19:19.059" style="s2">more with Harris than the vendor clay</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.049" end="00:19:21.340" style="s2">about the ontological status of events</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.059" end="00:19:22.690" style="s2">like the resurrection if so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.340" end="00:19:25.029" style="s2">real difference between your positions</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.690" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">do you see psychological value and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.029" end="00:19:31.419" style="s2">religion at sam Harris does not thanks</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:33.789" style="s2">also a very good question yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.419" end="00:19:38.409" style="s2">mean yeah it&#39;s a really good question</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.789" end="00:19:40.269" style="s2">and at this point I assume you would</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.409" end="00:19:42.340" style="s2">agree more with Harris than with van der</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.269" end="00:19:44.859" style="s2">clay about the ontological status of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.340" end="00:19:47.769" style="s2">events like the resurrection so speaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.859" end="00:19:48.849" style="s2">for me personally probably yes I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.769" end="00:19:50.200" style="s2">say to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.849" end="00:19:53.730" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.200" end="00:19:56.529" style="s2">however it&#39;s a complex question because</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.730" end="00:20:00.159" style="s2">something like the resurrection gets</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.529" end="00:20:01.960" style="s2">into the world of you know myth and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.159" end="00:20:05.919" style="s2">symbolism and what does the resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.960" end="00:20:09.190" style="s2">actually represent psychologically so</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.919" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">you know that&#39;s kind of where where my</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.190" end="00:20:13.539" style="s2">interests lie in terms of religion like</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">the word religion is also a tricky one</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.539" end="00:20:19.720" style="s2">because my spiritual practice is usually</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:23.139" style="s2">based around phenomenology it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.720" end="00:20:27.609" style="s2">it&#39;s experiential so I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.139" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">really big on belief I think faith is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.609" end="00:20:30.700" style="s2">important but that&#39;s like a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:33.489" style="s2">topic there&#39;s some things that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.700" end="00:20:37.539" style="s2">unknowable in a sense but belief I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.489" end="00:20:40.330" style="s2">always been skeptical of because for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.539" end="00:20:42.639" style="s2">it&#39;s about having a religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.330" end="00:20:44.049" style="s2">or say a spiritual experience or a peak</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.639" end="00:20:47.470" style="s2">mystical experience or whatever it might</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.049" end="00:20:49.929" style="s2">be and bringing my own individual</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.470" end="00:20:53.049" style="s2">sovereignty to integrating it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.929" end="00:20:54.999" style="s2">figuring out okay how do i how me my ego</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.049" end="00:20:59.350" style="s2">how do i integrate this what do I make</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.999" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">of this and that&#39;s always been my my way</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.350" end="00:21:06.249" style="s2">so I probably have yeah I probably do</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:08.289" style="s2">have a I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m like van der</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.249" end="00:21:12.789" style="s2">clay or Harris in my perspective on that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.289" end="00:21:20.769" style="s2">particular thing yeah hand over to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.789" end="00:21:24.279" style="s2">mmm I I feel like I&#39;m only starting now</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.769" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">to really grapple with the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.279" end="00:21:29.980" style="s2">story in any kind of meaningful way like</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:33.539" style="s2">we talked to Paul Lander clay I talked</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.980" end="00:21:39.999" style="s2">with Jonathan page oh the other night</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.539" end="00:21:43.419" style="s2">and he he had a sort of because because</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.999" end="00:21:46.239" style="s2">I also heard a few people say that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.419" end="00:21:48.879" style="s2">all hinges on the resurrection and I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.239" end="00:21:51.190" style="s2">not entirely sure what that means at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.879" end="00:21:52.779" style="s2">moment but I&#39;ve heard more than a few</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.190" end="00:21:55.659" style="s2">people talk about Christianity in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.779" end="00:21:57.609" style="s2">way but if the resurrection is not true</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.659" end="00:21:58.220" style="s2">then the whole of Christianity falls</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.609" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.220" end="00:22:05.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t quite understand all of that yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:08.809" style="s2">but what I and then when I when I asked</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.190" end="00:22:12.150" style="s2">that to Jonathan he said something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.809" end="00:22:13.500" style="s2">about that the resurrection is something</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.150" end="00:22:15.150" style="s2">that happens at the end of time and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.500" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">happens now and there&#39;s some inter</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.150" end="00:22:19.800" style="s2">relation between the resurrection is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:24.600" style="s2">always with us and is always happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.800" end="00:22:27.809" style="s2">in some sense I&#39;m paraphrasing probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.600" end="00:22:29.610" style="s2">badly but I think I I think I have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.809" end="00:22:34.860" style="s2">felt sense of what he might mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.610" end="00:22:37.530" style="s2">and he was also like I&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.860" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">taken by by the Jungian explanation or</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.530" end="00:22:43.170" style="s2">the Jungian examination of of Jesus as</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:46.020" style="s2">an archetype as kind of in a way it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.170" end="00:22:48.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter whether he existed</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.020" end="00:22:50.820" style="s2">as a person because what he embodies and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.900" end="00:22:54.929" style="s2">represents is the ideal person the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.820" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">human and whether that ideal human lived</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.929" end="00:22:57.929" style="s2">and whether that ideal came whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:22:59.550" style="s2">there have been other people who had the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.929" end="00:23:01.980" style="s2">same level of spiritual awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.550" end="00:23:04.160" style="s2">spiritual presence that he did there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.980" end="00:23:10.350" style="s2">a sort of moment where that archetype</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.160" end="00:23:13.620" style="s2">entered the world fully formed and it it</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.350" end="00:23:16.290" style="s2">means something to all of us and it has</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.620" end="00:23:17.640" style="s2">had a huge impact on the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.290" end="00:23:20.700" style="s2">Western culture in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.640" end="00:23:23.220" style="s2">world so the whole idea at the very</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.700" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">least has a reality there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.220" end="00:23:32.309" style="s2">deep resonance and reality the actual</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:36.390" style="s2">state of whether it applies to us to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.309" end="00:23:38.429" style="s2">person what that how that in a way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.390" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">joking that&#39;s a particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.429" end="00:23:45.559" style="s2">question mmm because the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:49.250" style="s2">questions are what is the nature of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.559" end="00:23:51.630" style="s2">archetype what is the nature of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.250" end="00:23:57.480" style="s2">yeah this archetype that has that has</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.630" end="00:23:59.700" style="s2">been so influential and I think I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.480" end="00:24:01.530" style="s2">yet know enough I&#39;m looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.700" end="00:24:03.300" style="s2">kind of having more conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.530" end="00:24:05.429" style="s2">people who maybe have more of a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.300" end="00:24:07.650" style="s2">understanding of what it means to them</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.429" end="00:24:12.800" style="s2">yeah I think the problem with wood</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.650" end="00:24:15.480" style="s2">religion is when they dispense with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.800" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">when it becomes a dogma it becomes just</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.480" end="00:24:23.700" style="s2">a set of a set of yeah when the dead</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.820" end="00:24:25.800" style="s2">word stops being infused with the living</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.700" end="00:24:27.210" style="s2">sort of inquiry hmm that&#39;s where I start</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.800" end="00:24:28.590" style="s2">to sort of lose patience and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.210" end="00:24:32.420" style="s2">talking cold and it&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.590" end="00:24:36.030" style="s2">really understand what that&#39;s about but</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.420" end="00:24:37.770" style="s2">yeah I think I think one other thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.030" end="00:24:38.760" style="s2">another interesting thing that Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.770" end="00:24:42.059" style="s2">says we&#39;re gonna put out Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.760" end="00:24:43.470" style="s2">Pedro&#39;s talk we talk for quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.059" end="00:24:45.059" style="s2">longer than the bit we&#39;ve put out so far</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.470" end="00:24:47.040" style="s2">but at the same Harris section so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.059" end="00:24:50.309" style="s2">got another section talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.040" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">value of organized religion and yeah his</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.309" end="00:24:57.030" style="s2">hairs on my history with Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:25:00.090" style="s2">and what I remember from that is his</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.030" end="00:25:02.100" style="s2">resistance to the Jungian analysis</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.090" end="00:25:04.500" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t think the religious</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.100" end="00:25:07.370" style="s2">should be reduced to the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.500" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">and I like I&#39;m again paraphrasing but</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.370" end="00:25:15.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s not a case of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:17.190" style="s2">it because if it&#39;s if it&#39;s religiously</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.000" end="00:25:20.280" style="s2">archetypal II true then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.190" end="00:25:23.580" style="s2">psychological will be a subset of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.280" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">kind of the deeper reality if that makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.580" end="00:25:29.850" style="s2">sense yeah yeah definitely I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:32.040" style="s2">is a huge topic I feel like we could</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.850" end="00:25:35.850" style="s2">talk about a lot I mean I have a few</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.040" end="00:25:39.140" style="s2">things bubbling away but I think because</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.850" end="00:25:42.350" style="s2">we have more content coming out on this</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.140" end="00:25:44.910" style="s2">and we&#39;ll do another Q&amp;A I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.350" end="00:25:47.340" style="s2">sit and Mull it over because it&#39;s so big</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.910" end="00:25:47.820" style="s2">actually and maybe move to the next</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.340" end="00:25:54.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.820" end="00:25:58.590" style="s2">yeah which is ah so this is a short one</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.679" end="00:26:01.170" style="s2">from Peter heads I have a glance out</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.590" end="00:26:03.960" style="s2">right have you read any CS Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.170" end="00:26:09.240" style="s2">apologetics if so what did you think no</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.960" end="00:26:11.429" style="s2">I haven&#39;t and I hated them I also</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.240" end="00:26:14.280" style="s2">haven&#39;t read them and I also hidden it</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.429" end="00:26:15.900" style="s2">no and we I I certainly haven&#39;t I did</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.280" end="00:26:18.780" style="s2">look it up to see if it would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.900" end="00:26:20.200" style="s2">possible to read in time but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.780" end="00:26:23.409" style="s2">like it&#39;s quite in</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.200" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot to it so thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.409" end="00:26:28.149" style="s2">bringing it up it&#39;s really good to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.570" end="00:26:30.820" style="s2">aware of but unfortunately can&#39;t can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.149" end="00:26:31.980" style="s2">add anything to that mm-hmm there is I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.820" end="00:26:34.779" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.980" end="00:26:36.789" style="s2">obviously I guess most people know CS</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.779" end="00:26:39.100" style="s2">Lewis the author of Lyon which in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.789" end="00:26:42.460" style="s2">Wardrobe which is a deeply kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.100" end="00:26:44.739" style="s2">allegorical very Christian story I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.460" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">heard about these before and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.739" end="00:26:49.359" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d like to check them out as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:52.840" style="s2">all I know about him is that he was part</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.359" end="00:26:54.609" style="s2">of a very interesting group of there was</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.840" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">a lot going on in the sort of 30s 40s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.609" end="00:27:01.869" style="s2">50s I think yeah in I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:07.299" style="s2">Cambridge yeah there was a group called</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.869" end="00:27:09.009" style="s2">the Inklings Tolkien was part of it CS</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.299" end="00:27:10.629" style="s2">Lewis was part of it couple other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.009" end="00:27:16.539" style="s2">were part of it sort of the very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.629" end="00:27:18.460" style="s2">English eccentric intellectual really</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.539" end="00:27:20.019" style="s2">trying to understand what the what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.460" end="00:27:22.659" style="s2">deeper structure of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.019" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">mythological stories was yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.659" end="00:27:26.859" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been sort of quite attracted</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:30.249" style="s2">to to learning a bit more about it like</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.859" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">them and I think TS Eliot&#39;s as well like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.249" end="00:27:33.820" style="s2">a really fascinating character because</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:35.529" style="s2">he was even atheist who wrote these</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.820" end="00:27:38.739" style="s2">amazing poems like The Hollow Men and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.529" end="00:27:40.899" style="s2">then had a Christian then became a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.739" end="00:27:42.850" style="s2">Christian later in life there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.899" end="00:27:46.659" style="s2">there was a lot of interesting stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.850" end="00:27:48.629" style="s2">in those life stories I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.659" end="00:27:51.789" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting processed here</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.629" end="00:27:54.539" style="s2">Elia because modern is it was very much</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.789" end="00:27:56.739" style="s2">a kind of disenchantment of the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.539" end="00:27:59.019" style="s2">it&#39;s called The Waste Land the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.739" end="00:28:00.820" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah and and a you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.019" end="00:28:03.639" style="s2">response to world were one in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.820" end="00:28:05.080" style="s2">as well around the that the roots of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.639" end="00:28:06.669" style="s2">post-modernism come from that of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.080" end="00:28:08.919" style="s2">everything we held sacred never came</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.669" end="00:28:11.710" style="s2">have seemed to be safe and secure was</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.919" end="00:28:13.649" style="s2">kind of blown to by World War one</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.710" end="00:28:15.700" style="s2">and then the kind of grappling with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.649" end="00:28:17.980" style="s2">modernist I studied modernist poetry</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.700" end="00:28:20.889" style="s2">quite a bit and it&#39;s got kind of a bleak</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.980" end="00:28:22.899" style="s2">Beauty to it but I didn&#39;t actually kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.889" end="00:28:24.669" style="s2">of forgotten that about Eliot that then</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.899" end="00:28:27.609" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of revival of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.669" end="00:28:29.470" style="s2">that probably I don&#39;t know I imagined</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.609" end="00:28:31.140" style="s2">was like you would have grass with both</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.470" end="00:28:32.970" style="s2">hands and a lot of people probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.140" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">would have at that time as well it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.970" end="00:28:38.310" style="s2">interesting thing - yeah yeah that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:40.920" style="s2">also interesting that that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.310" end="00:28:43.500" style="s2">the last time maybe because of the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.920" end="00:28:45.150" style="s2">nature of the times and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.500" end="00:28:47.100" style="s2">what we&#39;re going through again is some</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.150" end="00:28:49.170" style="s2">sort of sense of a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.100" end="00:28:53.010" style="s2">compared this time to a bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.170" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">sort of 1930s and 1960s maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.010" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">when you see these these spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">awakenings and religious awakenings yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:04.290" style="s2">so if you know the answers no to your</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.980" end="00:29:08.550" style="s2">question I have to get a nice to kill</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.290" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">five minutes out of it so what are we</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.550" end="00:29:14.390" style="s2">number seven liver so could you is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.500" style="s2">male you it&#39;s you there&#39;s some yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.390" end="00:29:17.640" style="s2">could you do interviews with two people</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.500" end="00:29:19.650" style="s2">who have different views on the deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.640" end="00:29:21.300" style="s2">issues I think these make the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.650" end="00:29:21.570" style="s2">interesting interactions and if you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.300" end="00:29:23.580" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.570" end="00:29:25.800" style="s2">I think conversation is preferable to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.580" end="00:29:28.040" style="s2">debate watching your content also in</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.800" end="00:29:30.540" style="s2">Israel keep up the good work</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.040" end="00:29:32.610" style="s2">don&#39;t forget muscle the muscle emoticon</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.540" end="00:29:35.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t have a motor oh yeah you do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.610" end="00:29:37.710" style="s2">yes definitely and I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.640" end="00:29:39.450" style="s2">good shout so we&#39;re gonna give your</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.710" end="00:29:42.840" style="s2">name&#39;s it&#39;s in Hebrew and we neither of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.450" end="00:29:44.370" style="s2">us can read Hebrew but yeah doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.840" end="00:29:46.290" style="s2">interviews of two people have different</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.370" end="00:29:49.020" style="s2">views and deep issues so I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.290" end="00:29:51.480" style="s2">great format I think again that requires</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.020" end="00:29:53.160" style="s2">this kind of it&#39;s part of why the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.480" end="00:29:54.870" style="s2">intellectual dark web works you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.160" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">there has to be an embodiment on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.870" end="00:29:59.310" style="s2">human level of a certain degree of kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:02.370" style="s2">of guess what Jordan green will call</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.310" end="00:30:05.820" style="s2">inner sovereignty to be able to hold a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.370" end="00:30:08.910" style="s2">space and not get into reactivity I</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.820" end="00:30:11.070" style="s2">think a lot of people can do that so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.910" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s really yeah great</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.070" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:20.430" style="s2">different ways to do that already</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:23.580" style="s2">so yeah yeah different views and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.430" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">deeper issues yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.580" end="00:30:33.390" style="s2">interesting to me too</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:35.490" style="s2">yeah kind of wonder whether like so far</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.390" end="00:30:37.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve been interviewing the people that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.490" end="00:30:40.710" style="s2">we want to interview that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.020" end="00:30:42.090" style="s2">interested in we like their ideas I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.710" end="00:30:42.790" style="s2">always interested in who are the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.090" end="00:30:45.370" style="s2">who push you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.790" end="00:30:47.020" style="s2">conversations forward I&#39;m not personally</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.370" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">interested in interviewing someone when</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.020" end="00:30:54.340" style="s2">I know what they&#39;re going to say hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:55.420" style="s2">don&#39;t find that particularly so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.340" end="00:30:57.820" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t want to interview</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.420" end="00:30:59.290" style="s2">people with different ideas just for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.820" end="00:31:02.350" style="s2">sake of it I think it would have to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.290" end="00:31:05.050" style="s2">when both of them had a had a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.350" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">that there was a genuine inquiry and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.050" end="00:31:09.550" style="s2">genuine to the possibility for evolution</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:12.280" style="s2">of their ideas yeah definitely there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.550" end="00:31:13.810" style="s2">something of in Zen there&#39;s beginner&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.280" end="00:31:16.060" style="s2">mind where you come without any</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.810" end="00:31:17.790" style="s2">preconceptions and there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.060" end="00:31:19.960" style="s2">lack of attachment to your own position</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.790" end="00:31:22.360" style="s2">and that actually is kind of rare</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.960" end="00:31:24.580" style="s2">sometimes you know it in academia for</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.360" end="00:31:26.830" style="s2">example it&#39;s very rare if you had two</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.580" end="00:31:28.780" style="s2">academics defending something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.830" end="00:31:30.850" style="s2">they&#39;d wrote their thesis on spent 30</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.780" end="00:31:32.740" style="s2">years lecturing and the worth trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.850" end="00:31:34.840" style="s2">do what they should be doing is finding</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.740" end="00:31:37.420" style="s2">some kind of truth that allows their</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.840" end="00:31:39.820" style="s2">ideas to burn away I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.420" end="00:31:42.250" style="s2">unlikely that that it&#39;s very likely when</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.820" end="00:31:43.720" style="s2">that happens yeah yeah yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.250" end="00:31:45.940" style="s2">more public profile someone has the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.720" end="00:31:51.730" style="s2">harder it is to yeah she&#39;d be generative</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.940" end="00:31:55.480" style="s2">for sure and next question is from G</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.730" end="00:31:57.070" style="s2">Thomas a few episodes back you guys were</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.480" end="00:31:58.660" style="s2">talking about some of the negative press</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.070" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">surrounding the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.660" end="00:32:03.190" style="s2">particularly Jordan Peterson an idea was</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:05.890" style="s2">touched on that I thought you might like</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.190" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">to expand on it seems the fact that dr.</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.890" end="00:32:10.110" style="s2">Peterson actually embodies his</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:12.070" style="s2">philosophy to a rare degree is</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.110" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">particularly confounding to his</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.070" end="00:32:16.120" style="s2">detractors the character attacks</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:19.000" style="s2">misrepresentation flat-out lies about</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.120" end="00:32:21.070" style="s2">him and his message is this evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.000" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">a disdain for not just the individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.070" end="00:32:24.430" style="s2">but also for what he represents I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:30.490" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.430" end="00:32:31.950" style="s2">what do you think I think yes yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.490" end="00:32:35.110" style="s2">think there&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.950" end="00:32:36.730" style="s2">concept here which is about congruence</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.110" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">and which is about living one&#39;s message</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.730" end="00:32:43.380" style="s2">out in the world because I agree very</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:46.510" style="s2">very few people actually live out their</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.380" end="00:32:48.970" style="s2">philosophy in the world and to a lesser</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.510" end="00:32:51.720" style="s2">degree or a similar degree they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.970" end="00:32:54.500" style="s2">actually they&#39;re actually is is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.720" end="00:32:59.810" style="s2">representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.500" end="00:33:04.310" style="s2">sort of the word psychological</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.810" end="00:33:07.000" style="s2">necessities on one level like I think it</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.310" end="00:33:12.410" style="s2">he talked about yawn and the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.000" end="00:33:16.040" style="s2">conjunction yeah something conjunction</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.410" end="00:33:17.870" style="s2">the conjunction mysterious mysterium</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.040" end="00:33:20.300" style="s2">conjunction the other mysterio</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.870" end="00:33:22.400" style="s2">conjunction I think where it&#39;s about a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.300" end="00:33:26.060" style="s2">deeper and deeper process of embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.400" end="00:33:28.990" style="s2">of your ideas in terms of your actions</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.060" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">yeah and then a deeper integration of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.990" end="00:33:33.020" style="s2">different perspectives and finally I</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.960" style="s2">think an integration of the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.020" end="00:33:40.610" style="s2">and feminine aspects of oneself that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.960" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">kind of the process of individuation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.610" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">I do think that that sense of someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:48.800" style="s2">who&#39;s really living out their ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:52.700" style="s2">the world and is living from that very</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.800" end="00:33:56.420" style="s2">deep place of true accountability and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.700" end="00:34:00.680" style="s2">general and genuine like I find a route</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.420" end="00:34:03.650" style="s2">I find a real yeah real integrity I do</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.680" end="00:34:05.450" style="s2">think does trigger people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.650" end="00:34:07.430" style="s2">living from that place yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.450" end="00:34:10.040" style="s2">it kind of on some subconscious level</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.430" end="00:34:12.409" style="s2">calls them out yeah and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.040" end="00:34:14.929" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reactivity to him</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.409" end="00:34:17.450" style="s2">it&#39;s because he&#39;s a walking rebuke to</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.929" end="00:34:19.100" style="s2">people who are not actually living out</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.450" end="00:34:21.350" style="s2">their philosophy in the world yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.100" end="00:34:25.010" style="s2">thought was I think that&#39;s wrong because</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.350" end="00:34:27.100" style="s2">there&#39;s especially the kind of message</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.010" end="00:34:30.169" style="s2">of self responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.100" end="00:34:34.300" style="s2">that&#39;s what like he said in the recent</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.169" end="00:34:36.379" style="s2">interview you did a left last week</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.300" end="00:34:40.429" style="s2">actually not should we put this bit out</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.379" end="00:34:42.110" style="s2">yet but he does preview he does mention</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.429" end="00:34:45.590" style="s2">you know especially with with radical</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.110" end="00:34:48.470" style="s2">people on the left and the example he</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.590" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">was using was like have you really taken</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.470" end="00:34:53.330" style="s2">full ownership of yourself and of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:57.430" style="s2">own individuality or are you projecting</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.330" end="00:34:59.870" style="s2">it outwards that was a question yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.430" end="00:35:01.550" style="s2">don&#39;t just say yes because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.870" end="00:35:03.290" style="s2">hardest things to do so don&#39;t assume</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.550" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">that you have exactly and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.290" end="00:35:06.700" style="s2">point it is constant work like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:09.010" style="s2">inner</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.700" end="00:35:11.020" style="s2">growth work and embodiment work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.010" end="00:35:12.700" style="s2">constant work I means like everyday work</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.020" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s also the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.700" end="00:35:18.099" style="s2">post-modernism is a like many people I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:20.920" style="s2">felt this a long time before I even</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.099" end="00:35:22.119" style="s2">discovered Peterson is it&#39;s you get into</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.920" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">an argument for someone who claims there</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.119" end="00:35:25.869" style="s2">is no truth and it&#39;s performative</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:27.220" style="s2">contradiction because they&#39;re arguing</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.869" end="00:35:28.990" style="s2">from a perspective there&#39;s no truth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.220" end="00:35:32.980" style="s2">like okay so that&#39;s your truth that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.990" end="00:35:34.450" style="s2">truth and also that you cannot there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.980" end="00:35:35.589" style="s2">certain things about especially the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.450" end="00:35:36.849" style="s2">philosophy post-modernism that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.589" end="00:35:40.210" style="s2">cannot live out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.849" end="00:35:43.060" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t you can&#39;t spend any time</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.210" end="00:35:46.260" style="s2">at all believing there&#39;s no truth and if</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.060" end="00:35:48.970" style="s2">you I think this is Jonathan pathos</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.260" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">really clever way of framing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.970" end="00:35:53.109" style="s2">well if if if you&#39;re a dedicated post</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:54.790" style="s2">modernist and I come up to you and I say</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.530" end="00:36:02.670" style="s2">they look very intimate you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.550" end="00:36:05.050" style="s2">say well there was no truth yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.670" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">your body is gonna tell you certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.050" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">things yes like well yeah I I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:14.349" style="s2">very high sort of share with Peter and a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:15.339" style="s2">frustration of people who claim to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.349" end="00:36:17.260" style="s2">a philosophy that they&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.339" end="00:36:19.480" style="s2">living out in their in their lives yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.260" end="00:36:21.160" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s a really good point</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.480" end="00:36:24.609" style="s2">there&#39;s also that this this thing of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.160" end="00:36:27.819" style="s2">victimhood culture which is rampant he</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.609" end="00:36:29.800" style="s2">he stands us completely something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.819" end="00:36:35.050" style="s2">challenges that actually and teaching</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.800" end="00:36:36.670" style="s2">meditation I I often say the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.050" end="00:36:38.670" style="s2">that drops from your vocabulary when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.670" end="00:36:40.599" style="s2">start meditating is I couldn&#39;t help it</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.670" end="00:36:42.730" style="s2">you know this whole thing of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.599" end="00:36:46.270" style="s2">trigger warning so triggered I just</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.730" end="00:36:48.010" style="s2">can&#39;t you know that is that can that can</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.270" end="00:36:49.390" style="s2">go with practice and I can go with</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.010" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">taking personal responsibility for your</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.390" end="00:36:54.910" style="s2">own inner world and that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:56.470" style="s2">hard process so it&#39;s easier to stay in</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.910" end="00:36:57.849" style="s2">the victim thing and then to the point</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.470" end="00:37:00.520" style="s2">you made the beginning of this question</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.849" end="00:37:02.619" style="s2">then you start projecting it out to</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.520" end="00:37:03.910" style="s2">wherever you see it embodied the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.619" end="00:37:06.849" style="s2">you don&#39;t have or the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.910" end="00:37:10.089" style="s2">rejecting is embody just so pushing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.849" end="00:37:14.349" style="s2">out so I think yeah so yes we agree we</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.089" end="00:37:16.359" style="s2">agree we also force number nine</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.349" end="00:37:20.219" style="s2">a forbidden question that no one can</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.359" end="00:37:22.239" style="s2">talk about oh god we shouldn&#39;t read over</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.219" end="00:37:24.099" style="s2">Louise brought this up and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.239" end="00:37:25.809" style="s2">very important question where our</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.099" end="00:37:27.609" style="s2">women&#39;s long form deep insights and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.809" end="00:37:32.890" style="s2">opinions about the pieces of movement ie</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.609" end="00:37:34.719" style="s2">Jungian psychology motivations political</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.890" end="00:37:37.719" style="s2">issues men&#39;s movement open dialog about</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.719" end="00:37:39.099" style="s2">societal problems etc etc it seems women</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.719" end="00:37:42.219" style="s2">are not participating in these long form</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.099" end="00:37:43.809" style="s2">discussions or am i rolling in there in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.219" end="00:37:45.789" style="s2">an echo chamber I really want to know</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.809" end="00:37:47.130" style="s2">the other side of the equation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.789" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">deep insights from a female perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.130" end="00:37:53.529" style="s2">likewise I really want to as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:55.869" style="s2">we certainly haven&#39;t been actually those</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.529" end="00:37:57.940" style="s2">question to you oh yeah no but yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.869" end="00:38:00.279" style="s2">just gonna repeat that as well no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.940" end="00:38:03.910" style="s2">really I also I&#39;m really curious about</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.279" end="00:38:06.009" style="s2">this and that we have you know some</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.910" end="00:38:08.499" style="s2">amazing women in our circles who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.009" end="00:38:11.109" style="s2">engaged at these type of ideas very</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.499" end="00:38:16.569" style="s2">happy to talk about them and I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.109" end="00:38:18.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of the the format of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.569" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">like you know most of the stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.519" end="00:38:22.599" style="s2">happening on YouTube people really</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:23.979" style="s2">putting themselves out there whether</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.599" end="00:38:25.779" style="s2">that&#39;s got something to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.979" end="00:38:26.979" style="s2">whether these conversations are</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.779" end="00:38:30.190" style="s2">happening somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.979" end="00:38:32.559" style="s2">whether the confident maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.190" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">conversation around the current form of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.559" end="00:38:36.969" style="s2">feminism is so loud that it makes being</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:39.609" style="s2">a woman and saying anything a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.969" end="00:38:42.999" style="s2">different like Louise did those previous</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.609" end="00:38:45.160" style="s2">interviews quite a risky thing to do mmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.999" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">maybe arguably more risky for a woman</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.160" end="00:38:53.259" style="s2">than a man I don&#39;t know yeah so the next</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:55.319" style="s2">question is from James Carmichael and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.259" end="00:38:57.999" style="s2">James you&#39;ve shortened it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.319" end="00:39:02.410" style="s2">but James tells quite a touching story</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.999" end="00:39:05.289" style="s2">of having been born with visually</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.410" end="00:39:10.809" style="s2">impaired and then having experiences in</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.289" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">school where you would always have</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.809" end="00:39:15.039" style="s2">support from the teachers and when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:16.269" style="s2">try to talk about that being</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.039" end="00:39:18.759" style="s2">uncomfortable for you the way it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.269" end="00:39:20.229" style="s2">given they kind of as you put it</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.759" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">you were given a shut up because we know</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.229" end="00:39:26.109" style="s2">what&#39;s best look and then you go on to</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.290" end="00:40:27.050" style="s2">think the the level of personal insight</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.050" end="00:40:30.619" style="s2">way is showing that you&#39;re you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.579" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">right track and because there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:48.109" style="s2">yeah I want to say that like if it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.700" end="00:40:50.690" style="s2">can we can give a little bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.109" end="00:40:52.310" style="s2">advice but if if what you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.690" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">with the moment is kind of alcohol and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.310" end="00:41:00.470" style="s2">and drugs then alcohol and drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:41:02.829" style="s2">therapy aana it could be something to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.470" end="00:41:02.829" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.950" end="00:41:07.670" style="s2">grief counseling as well because early</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.510" end="00:41:11.150" style="s2">that you said your father died about</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.670" end="00:41:13.310" style="s2">nine years ago I certainly found when my</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.150" end="00:41:16.940" style="s2">father died but I needed to go through</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.310" end="00:41:22.280" style="s2">some serious yeah getting a letting a</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.940" end="00:41:23.780" style="s2">lot of the emotions out in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.280" end="00:41:27.230" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re generally pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.780" end="00:41:31.069" style="s2">stable then I&#39;d say the thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.230" end="00:41:33.920" style="s2">been the most rewarding for me is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.069" end="00:41:35.630" style="s2">men&#39;s group where we have to teach men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.920" end="00:41:39.410" style="s2">work and we&#39;re in a we&#39;re in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.630" end="00:41:43.780" style="s2">men&#39;s circle together and just to have</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.410" end="00:41:45.940" style="s2">this space to really speak</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.780" end="00:41:47.530" style="s2">what&#39;s real what&#39;s true what&#39;s authentic</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.940" end="00:41:49.830" style="s2">with other men I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.530" end="00:41:55.000" style="s2">important and I think men in particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.830" end="00:41:57.700" style="s2">we&#39;re now quite aware we can become very</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.000" end="00:41:59.619" style="s2">isolated and get older and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.700" end="00:42:02.890" style="s2">easy for us to become isolated and also</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.619" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">I think to look for support in women and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.890" end="00:42:06.070" style="s2">girlfriends that actually we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:08.859" style="s2">finding outside the relationship to</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.859" end="00:42:12.250" style="s2">not not that we should talk about some</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.599" end="00:42:13.450" style="s2">things but the balance I think is all</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.250" end="00:42:16.090" style="s2">wrong if we&#39;re looking for all of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.450" end="00:42:17.650" style="s2">sustenance from the entire relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.090" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">yeah you end up making your partner like</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.440" end="00:42:37.090" style="s2">echo what David said yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.950" end="00:42:38.590" style="s2">traditional therapies especially the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.090" end="00:42:41.349" style="s2">right therapists are very important if</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.590" end="00:42:44.380" style="s2">it is something that is substance abuse</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.570" end="00:45:33.950" style="s2">brand of feminism is that a fair thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:36.010" style="s2">to say and how do those counts relate to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.950" end="00:45:38.360" style="s2">the current dichotomy of gender politics</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.010" end="00:45:42.050" style="s2">feminism the third wave and the second</p>

<p begin="00:48:12.390" end="00:48:16.170" style="s2">certainly not a this is a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.000" end="00:48:17.700" style="s2">question when someone says are you a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.170" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">feminist because it&#39;s usually a barb</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.700" end="00:48:21.630" style="s2">it&#39;s usually a hook yeah because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:23.670" style="s2">no right answer to that and to remain in</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.630" end="00:48:25.260" style="s2">polite society yeah because you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.670" end="00:48:27.890" style="s2">give the same art to the Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.260" end="00:48:30.329" style="s2">would give which is if you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.890" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be great for men and women</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.329" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">to be able to offer their skills from</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:38.930" style="s2">from from an equal basis absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:41.369" style="s2">anything less is it&#39;s crazy yeah if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.930" end="00:48:45.210" style="s2">the idea that the world is a corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.369" end="00:48:48.029" style="s2">patriarchy and men need to atone for</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.210" end="00:48:51.269" style="s2">that and no that&#39;s ideology and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.029" end="00:48:52.859" style="s2">not something that I&#39;m into yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.269" end="00:48:54.180" style="s2">likewise just on that point I have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.859" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">very similar feeling around that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.180" end="00:48:59.430" style="s2">question I&#39;ve never described myself as</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:01.380" style="s2">a feminist but then again of course of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.430" end="00:49:04.859" style="s2">course I want equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.380" end="00:49:06.660" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s important to strive for</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.859" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">that but as the ideology and as the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.660" end="00:49:13.140" style="s2">conspiracy theory no and as thick the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:15.450" style="s2">the way it&#39;s turned into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.140" end="00:49:17.579" style="s2">castration and shaming of the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.450" end="00:49:20.190" style="s2">actually find that like I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.579" end="00:49:21.390" style="s2">really not okay with that and I find</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.190" end="00:49:23.579" style="s2">that a lot of the men you comfort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.390" end="00:49:27.059" style="s2">workshops as well have internalized that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.579" end="00:49:29.369" style="s2">to the degree to a large degree often</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.059" end="00:49:33.029" style="s2">all of us have to some extent and part</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.369" end="00:49:34.349" style="s2">of the work we do is it&#39;s going through</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.029" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">that and coming out and it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.349" end="00:49:40.710" style="s2">grounded in body confident and relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:42.180" style="s2">masculinity yeah honestly that those</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.710" end="00:49:44.789" style="s2">comments early pissed me off from that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.180" end="00:49:46.470" style="s2">guy and it&#39;s interesting that it&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.789" end="00:49:49.619" style="s2">up you know that&#39;s someone&#39;s read them</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.470" end="00:49:53.160" style="s2">because yeah for a similar reason to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.619" end="00:49:55.349" style="s2">what you you laid out it&#39;s this I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.160" end="00:49:58.769" style="s2">understand and would agree with like</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.349" end="00:50:02.339" style="s2">that the nice guy thing of men being</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.769" end="00:50:04.890" style="s2">like really overly vulnerable all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.339" end="00:50:06.660" style="s2">time to kind of score points or because</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.890" end="00:50:09.480" style="s2">that&#39;s like oh that&#39;s it thank you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.660" end="00:50:11.039" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to have sex with girls</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.480" end="00:50:12.569" style="s2">that also probably doesn&#39;t I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.039" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">worked a couple of times for them but</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.569" end="00:50:19.309" style="s2">like that is really not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">I&#39;m not about that at all but being</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.309" end="00:50:23.130" style="s2">being in touch with your emotions is</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:27.269" style="s2">absolutely essential</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.130" end="00:50:29.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s what the this kind of reaction</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.269" end="00:50:32.789" style="s2">against that from from a few people for</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.880" end="00:50:35.970" style="s2">me that&#39;s that&#39;s boy a boyish victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.789" end="00:50:37.529" style="s2">mmm it&#39;s not it&#39;s not for me I look at</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.970" end="00:50:39.630" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s manly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.529" end="00:50:41.160" style="s2">know what should black mic for I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.630" end="00:50:43.049" style="s2">know any women who would look at that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.160" end="00:50:45.569" style="s2">and find that sexy or empowering or</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.049" end="00:50:49.880" style="s2">strong it would just be like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.569" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">something unresolved there yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.880" end="00:50:54.239" style="s2">aporia now we forgot to we forgot to set</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:51:00.599" style="s2">a clock before we started doing this so</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.239" end="00:51:04.460" style="s2">we yeah yeah it&#39;s wanted to conclude</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.599" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">that by saying we&#39;ve we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.460" end="00:51:11.309" style="s2">renamed our weekend workshop a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:14.460" style="s2">masculinity yeah so we are I think what</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.309" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">we&#39;re offering is where we&#39;re placing it</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.460" end="00:51:21.900" style="s2">is within an evolutionary framework of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:25.619" style="s2">responding to the to the the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.900" end="00:51:28.259" style="s2">feminism but not from a and I find too</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.619" end="00:51:30.869" style="s2">much of the root of the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.259" end="00:51:36.359" style="s2">activist movement is in reactivity to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.869" end="00:51:38.579" style="s2">that feminism like it&#39;s it&#39;s saying well</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.359" end="00:51:40.170" style="s2">these angry women in feminism but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.579" end="00:51:42.239" style="s2">it&#39;s got a real Lang it&#39;s got a real</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.170" end="00:51:44.130" style="s2">wreck reactivity to it and a real anger</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.239" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">of its own and it can easily just become</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.130" end="00:51:47.849" style="s2">another victim story</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:50.519" style="s2">yeah like women women did this to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.849" end="00:51:51.960" style="s2">yeah rather than an empowering taking</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.519" end="00:51:56.219" style="s2">responsibility for ourselves on a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.960" end="00:51:59.299" style="s2">narrative and so that that is how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.219" end="00:52:01.799" style="s2">framing it we&#39;re framing it as as</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.299" end="00:52:03.180" style="s2">offering and I think that has to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.799" end="00:52:05.190" style="s2">space of personal growth that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.180" end="00:52:07.890" style="s2">a space of sort of really embodying our</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.190" end="00:52:10.229" style="s2">masculinity and because because also</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.890" end="00:52:12.749" style="s2">what we&#39;re then fighting against this</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.229" end="00:52:14.789" style="s2">kind of gender neutrality of well there</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.749" end="00:52:16.469" style="s2">is no such thing as masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.789" end="00:52:19.259" style="s2">femininity it&#39;s all gender neutral and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.469" end="00:52:19.979" style="s2">we sort of plant a flag and say no</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.259" end="00:52:23.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.979" end="00:52:26.519" style="s2">yeah and your deep embodied reality is</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.880" end="00:52:28.529" style="s2">as a man in my experience for myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.519" end="00:52:30.390" style="s2">certainly most of the men that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.529" end="00:52:31.220" style="s2">in our workshops there is something</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.390" end="00:52:34.220" style="s2">tangible as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.220" end="00:52:36.380" style="s2">we can tap into the is it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.220" end="00:52:39.980" style="s2">something that when we ground ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.380" end="00:52:44.540" style="s2">in that we find our relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.980" end="00:52:46.070" style="s2">women improve yeah and other men and but</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.540" end="00:52:47.869" style="s2">everyone pretty much more present and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.070" end="00:52:53.800" style="s2">more authentic which creates trust in</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.869" end="00:52:56.090" style="s2">men or women yeah yeah great and then so</p>
