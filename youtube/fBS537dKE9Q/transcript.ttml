<p begin="00:00:06.410" end="00:00:12.240" style="s2">Jordan it&#39;s great to to interview you</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:14.700" style="s2">again I interviewed you back in October</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:17.850" style="s2">last year and then made I&#39;ve now made</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">two documentaries about you and a big</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.850" end="00:00:23.910" style="s2">focus for rebel wisdom is kind of making</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:25.260" style="s2">sense of the cultural moment and making</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.910" end="00:00:28.109" style="s2">sense of your success and what it</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.260" end="00:00:29.580" style="s2">represents and I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.109" end="00:00:30.810" style="s2">remember but the very first question I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.580" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">asked you back in October in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.810" end="00:00:34.710" style="s2">interview was firstly what do you make</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">of your success so far and are you ready</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">for it to continue because I had I had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">sense back then that what your message</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">represented was something the culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">desperately needed the sort of and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">that signifies to me is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">reintegration of the sacred did you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:53.010" style="s2">any sense back then the the exponential</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">success that you were going to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.010" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">between then and now well I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">most likely outcome at each of the what</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">would you say at each point where I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">might notice what&#39;s going on around me</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">has been that this was stopped but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t stopping so I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">about that pretty much non-stop I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">say and I have some some solutions let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">say or some ideas that I didn&#39;t present</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:27.619" style="s2">in October so one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:31.350" style="s2">realized is that part of what&#39;s pushing</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.619" end="00:01:33.979" style="s2">part of what&#39;s accounting for this the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">popularity of my ideas is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.979" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">secondary consequence of a technological</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:42.780" style="s2">revolution and I&#39;ve seen that more</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">clearly since October party because I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.780" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">can see the mainstream media dying at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">faster and faster rate and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:55.829" style="s2">alternative media expanding faster and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">faster so television radio and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">classic print media had shared one thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">in common which was a extreme</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">restriction in bandwidth this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:10.700" style="s2">especially true of television because</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:13.180" style="s2">each minute of television given the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.700" end="00:02:16.599" style="s2">necessity to broadcast in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.180" end="00:02:19.209" style="s2">that was unbelievably expensive and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.599" end="00:02:19.959" style="s2">there just wasn&#39;t time to do anything on</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.209" end="00:02:23.890" style="s2">television</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.959" end="00:02:27.159" style="s2">there&#39;s no time and so if you had</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.890" end="00:02:28.599" style="s2">something important to say or even</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.159" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">something unimportant for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.599" end="00:02:33.879" style="s2">most of the time it had to be compressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:35.560" style="s2">into something approximating 30 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.879" end="00:02:38.290" style="s2">which wouldn&#39;t even be your words it</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.560" end="00:02:41.049" style="s2">would be a journalist common commenting</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.290" end="00:02:44.469" style="s2">on what you said and if you were really</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.049" end="00:02:46.269" style="s2">pushing the envelope maybe you&#39;d have 25</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.469" end="00:02:48.489" style="s2">minutes on a talk show that was devoted</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.269" end="00:02:52.810" style="s2">to your ideas but then even that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.489" end="00:02:55.439" style="s2">be highly scripted and so television</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.810" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">made people look stupider than they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.439" end="00:03:02.500" style="s2">even to the producers of television</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:06.900" style="s2">because of this narrow bandwidth the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.500" end="00:03:09.969" style="s2">rise of video online and audio as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:13.900" style="s2">has blown the bandwidth limitation out</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.969" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">of our mass communication and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.900" end="00:03:19.829" style="s2">out that people are smarter with longer</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.650" end="00:03:23.079" style="s2">attention spans than we thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.829" end="00:03:25.299" style="s2">what happened with me was that for one</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.079" end="00:03:28.569" style="s2">reason or another I was an early adopter</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.299" end="00:03:30.939" style="s2">of that technology and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.569" end="00:03:33.939" style="s2">massive technological transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.939" end="00:03:37.150" style="s2">which is a Gutenberg revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.939" end="00:03:39.099" style="s2">provision of video and audio no barrier</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.150" end="00:03:41.799" style="s2">to production because it doesn&#39;t cost</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.099" end="00:03:43.629" style="s2">anything anyone can do it people can</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.799" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">communicate with it you can cut up</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.629" end="00:03:47.409" style="s2">YouTube videos you can make your</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:49.989" style="s2">documentaries the entry point is easy</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.409" end="00:03:52.090" style="s2">audio podcasts and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.989" end="00:03:55.689" style="s2">which can be of indefinite length allow</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.090" end="00:03:58.540" style="s2">people to use found time to listen more</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.689" end="00:04:00.639" style="s2">people can listen than can read like all</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">of these things add up to a massive</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.639" end="00:04:07.150" style="s2">technological revolution and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:10.810" style="s2">upswell in technology that in part has</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.150" end="00:04:15.549" style="s2">propelled what I&#39;ve been doing to to to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.810" end="00:04:17.109" style="s2">to to to to to this mass audience and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.549" end="00:04:19.030" style="s2">that&#39;s been a relief to figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.109" end="00:04:21.609" style="s2">because it depersonalized is it to some</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.030" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">degree right and so I used the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.609" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">when I&#39;ve been asked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:28.510" style="s2">of being on a wave</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:30.580" style="s2">I&#39;m surfing on a giant wave but the wave</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.510" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that I&#39;ve done it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.580" end="00:04:36.040" style="s2">of this technological revolution so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:37.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a relief to know that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.040" end="00:04:39.610" style="s2">quite convinced that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:43.300" style="s2">because there are other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.610" end="00:04:45.340" style="s2">occupying the same space essentially Joe</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.300" end="00:04:48.970" style="s2">Rogan is a very good example of that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.340" end="00:04:51.820" style="s2">the various commentators on on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.970" end="00:04:54.850" style="s2">who&#39;ve become increasingly influential</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.820" end="00:04:56.440" style="s2">and powerful same thing driven by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.850" end="00:04:59.380" style="s2">technology they happen to be early</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.440" end="00:05:01.270" style="s2">adopters and so and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.380" end="00:05:03.460" style="s2">secondary question which is well is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.270" end="00:05:06.280" style="s2">there anything specific in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.460" end="00:05:09.370" style="s2">to my content let&#39;s say and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.280" end="00:05:11.229" style="s2">also that is it the case and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.370" end="00:05:14.250" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been able to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.229" end="00:05:20.130" style="s2">reasonable effectiveness is to draw a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.250" end="00:05:23.590" style="s2">conceptual equation equivalence between</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.130" end="00:05:26.470" style="s2">the meaning that&#39;s necessary to sustain</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.590" end="00:05:30.010" style="s2">you in life given its suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.470" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">malevolence and the necessity to adopt</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.010" end="00:05:33.700" style="s2">responsibility and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:37.000" style="s2">something new about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:39.130" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t know how new I&#39;m sure I</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.000" end="00:05:41.560" style="s2">am NOT the first person who&#39;s discovered</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.130" end="00:05:45.370" style="s2">that but I think I&#39;ve done a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.560" end="00:05:47.410" style="s2">job of pointing out to people that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.370" end="00:05:50.169" style="s2">the suffering that&#39;s intrinsic to life</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.410" end="00:05:54.010" style="s2">in the absence of meaning is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.169" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">tolerable it it it destroys and corrupts</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.010" end="00:05:59.620" style="s2">and that the proper pathway out of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t rights or happiness or entitlement</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.620" end="00:06:07.330" style="s2">or or anything that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.720" end="00:06:08.979" style="s2">with with individual ease let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.330" end="00:06:11.320" style="s2">with the adoption of something</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.979" end="00:06:14.380" style="s2">approximating maximum responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.320" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">people get that like it&#39;s it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.380" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">hard to understand when it&#39;s laid out</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:20.830" style="s2">like that and lots of people especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:23.560" style="s2">young people especially people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.830" end="00:06:26.440" style="s2">young and also somewhat nihilistic in</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.560" end="00:06:28.889" style="s2">their orientation perhaps because of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.440" end="00:06:32.349" style="s2">excess of intellectual criticism are</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.889" end="00:06:34.510" style="s2">they grab that immediately think oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.349" end="00:06:36.610" style="s2">there&#39;s the missing piece I see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.510" end="00:06:38.919" style="s2">that the the antidote to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:43.419" style="s2">meaninglessness this void that I&#39;m for</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.919" end="00:06:45.639" style="s2">isn&#39;t hedonism it&#39;s not right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.419" end="00:06:48.520" style="s2">impulsive pleasure it&#39;s none of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.639" end="00:06:50.979" style="s2">it&#39;s responsibility it&#39;s like oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:54.039" style="s2">okay that everything snaps into place</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.979" end="00:06:57.129" style="s2">and so that&#39;s been I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.039" end="00:06:58.419" style="s2">most essential part of the message to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.129" end="00:07:00.699" style="s2">the degree that what I&#39;m doing has an</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.419" end="00:07:02.379" style="s2">essential message that would be it and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.699" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">do think that&#39;s what accounts for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.379" end="00:07:09.279" style="s2">large part of its impact and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:10.689" style="s2">mentioned Joe Rogan before you and here</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.279" end="00:07:12.310" style="s2">group together in this sort of new</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.689" end="00:07:15.430" style="s2">constellation of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.310" end="00:07:16.900" style="s2">web what do you see is the I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.430" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">you make of your kind of inclusion in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.900" end="00:07:21.370" style="s2">this and what do you see is its role</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:25.469" style="s2">going forward in the culture well well</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.370" end="00:07:29.409" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like a herd of cats</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.469" end="00:07:32.740" style="s2">right because so I&#39;ve thought about well</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.409" end="00:07:34.509" style="s2">what what what unites us to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.740" end="00:07:36.909" style="s2">that there&#39;s an us because that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.509" end="00:07:40.629" style="s2">self-evident there&#39;s enough of an us so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.909" end="00:07:42.819" style="s2">that the name emerged and it&#39;s stuck so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.629" end="00:07:44.830" style="s2">so there&#39;s something in common because</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.819" end="00:07:47.439" style="s2">otherwise the name wouldn&#39;t have stuck</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.830" end="00:07:50.289" style="s2">right you can&#39;t name nothing it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.439" end="00:07:52.569" style="s2">work and I&#39;ve talked a fair bit about</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.289" end="00:07:55.000" style="s2">this with Dave Rubin because Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.569" end="00:07:58.060" style="s2">and I have been touring together right</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.000" end="00:08:02.199" style="s2">he opens my my discussions and adds a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.060" end="00:08:03.779" style="s2">nice comedic touch to them and so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.199" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">do we have in common</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.779" end="00:08:09.129" style="s2">everybody in the group is an independent</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:11.879" style="s2">practitioner so an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.129" end="00:08:15.550" style="s2">essentially with their own media</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.879" end="00:08:17.710" style="s2">enterprise that&#39;s autonomous none of us</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.550" end="00:08:21.819" style="s2">are serving any master except the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.710" end="00:08:24.159" style="s2">audience so so and and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.819" end="00:08:26.649" style="s2">somewhat independent financially as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.159" end="00:08:30.399" style="s2">consequence of that and so that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.649" end="00:08:32.769" style="s2">beholden to no master all of us are</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.399" end="00:08:35.649" style="s2">engaged in these long-form discussions</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.769" end="00:08:37.690" style="s2">right and one of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.649" end="00:08:39.579" style="s2">being engaged in a long-form discussion</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.690" end="00:08:41.500" style="s2">is that you can assume that your</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.579" end="00:08:43.779" style="s2">intelligence that your audience is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.500" end="00:08:45.640" style="s2">intelligent and so that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.779" end="00:08:47.829" style="s2">that unites everybody in the group is we</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.640" end="00:08:49.899" style="s2">all assume that our audience is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.829" end="00:08:52.150" style="s2">intelligent but I think that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.899" end="00:08:54.250" style="s2">so much a consequence of any</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.150" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">particular moral virtue on our parts but</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.250" end="00:08:59.530" style="s2">an observation that the technology has</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:01.330" style="s2">made possible it&#39;s like oh when you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.530" end="00:09:02.650" style="s2">see this I would say particularly with</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.330" end="00:09:05.220" style="s2">Roman because in some sense he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.650" end="00:09:07.570" style="s2">trailblazer in this domain it&#39;s like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.220" end="00:09:09.700" style="s2">turns out my audience will listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.570" end="00:09:11.110" style="s2">three-hour discussion but he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.700" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">been able to discover that without the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.110" end="00:09:16.810" style="s2">technology right so now to his credit he</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.820" style="s2">was smart enough to discover it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:21.310" style="s2">smart enough to notice it when he</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.820" end="00:09:22.930" style="s2">discovered it and so and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.310" end="00:09:24.550" style="s2">also characterizes the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.930" end="00:09:27.010" style="s2">people in this group it&#39;s like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.550" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">at that the audience actually wants our</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.010" end="00:09:34.290" style="s2">listeners let&#39;s say in viewers want</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">detailed in-depth unscripted spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.290" end="00:09:39.880" style="s2">meaningful conversation and then really</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:41.890" style="s2">are willing to go in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.880" end="00:09:44.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the risk-taking element like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.890" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">can give an example of that so I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.860" end="00:09:52.030" style="s2">did for talks with Sam Harris who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:54.310" style="s2">often grouped into this group as well on</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.030" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">the relationship between science and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.310" end="00:09:57.460" style="s2">religion say or facts and values that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:10:00.040" style="s2">another way of thinking about it with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.460" end="00:10:02.670" style="s2">bit of politics thrown in discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.040" end="00:10:05.500" style="s2">left/right differences and so on</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.670" end="00:10:09.250" style="s2">what&#39;s the willingness to take the risk</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.500" end="00:10:11.890" style="s2">well I had no idea when I Ament Sam in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.250" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">Vancouver which was where the first two</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.890" end="00:10:16.540" style="s2">of the four talks were held I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:18.910" style="s2">met him before we did a two podcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.540" end="00:10:21.430" style="s2">together one of which was very we got</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.910" end="00:10:23.710" style="s2">locked in the other one which was more</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.430" end="00:10:28.660" style="s2">productive I would say but I had no idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.710" end="00:10:32.410" style="s2">of he had I could talk but we we we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.660" end="00:10:36.340" style="s2">willing to willing to I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.410" end="00:10:39.880" style="s2">right agreed to take the risk to see if</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.340" end="00:10:41.290" style="s2">we could talk in a public forum and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.880" end="00:10:43.180" style="s2">I think that&#39;s another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.290" end="00:10:44.950" style="s2">characterizes the people in that group</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.180" end="00:10:47.410" style="s2">is that they will take those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.950" end="00:10:50.130" style="s2">risks if you go into a television studio</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.410" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">a classic television studio all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.130" end="00:10:54.040" style="s2">conversation is scripted and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:55.720" style="s2">actually quite frustrating because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.040" end="00:10:57.580" style="s2">can&#39;t have a conversation with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.720" end="00:10:58.060" style="s2">journalist because the journalist isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.580" end="00:11:02.170" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.060" end="00:11:04.120" style="s2">who&#39;s there is a frontispiece for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.170" end="00:11:05.590" style="s2">organization and the organization has</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.120" end="00:11:07.900" style="s2">scripted all there</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.590" end="00:11:09.940" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not actually like talking to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.900" end="00:11:13.840" style="s2">a person it&#39;s really like talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.940" end="00:11:16.570" style="s2">puppet so for better or for worse but in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.840" end="00:11:19.270" style="s2">these long unscripted long-form</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.570" end="00:11:22.870" style="s2">conversations then you can take the risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.270" end="00:11:24.850" style="s2">of having a conversation and that can go</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.870" end="00:11:27.310" style="s2">spectacularly well but it can also fail</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.850" end="00:11:30.220" style="s2">dismally so I would say those are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.310" end="00:11:34.089" style="s2">things that unite us to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.220" end="00:11:38.110" style="s2">the group exists I mean I admit I was in</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.089" end="00:11:43.150" style="s2">LA a week ago and about seven of us got</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.110" end="00:11:44.950" style="s2">together for for dinner and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.150" end="00:11:48.370" style="s2">first time we we met as anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.950" end="00:11:49.540" style="s2">approximating a group and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.370" end="00:11:51.400" style="s2">was interesting to watch everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.540" end="00:11:53.050" style="s2">interact because as I said it really is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.400" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">a herd of cats there&#39;s tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.050" end="00:11:57.640" style="s2">diversity of political opinion and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:00.970" style="s2">tremendous diversity of personality like</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.640" end="00:12:02.500" style="s2">Eric Weinstein and Joe Rogan like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.970" end="00:12:07.150" style="s2">they&#39;re not even members of the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.500" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">species in some ways you know so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.150" end="00:12:14.860" style="s2">a very fractious group but I think those</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">things that I outlined are the elements</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.860" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">that basically unite it there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:21.520" style="s2">something that I sense watching some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:24.460" style="s2">the discussions there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.520" end="00:12:27.089" style="s2">intellectual curiosity and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.460" end="00:12:29.560" style="s2">people thinking in public and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.089" end="00:12:30.910" style="s2">there&#39;s also a sense of maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.560" end="00:12:33.550" style="s2">potential for people to change their</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.910" end="00:12:34.930" style="s2">minds or to discover things during the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.550" end="00:12:37.060" style="s2">conversation well that&#39;s partly the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.930" end="00:12:39.430" style="s2">appreciation of the intelligence of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.060" end="00:12:41.890" style="s2">audience it&#39;s like and I would say it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.430" end="00:12:44.080" style="s2">actually the manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.890" end="00:12:46.180" style="s2">process of thinking that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.080" end="00:12:48.190" style="s2">important than the conclusions that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.180" end="00:12:50.470" style="s2">generated even in these discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.190" end="00:12:54.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having with Harris like we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.470" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">trying to to argue out to different</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.970" end="00:13:00.339" style="s2">viewpoints because Harris believes that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:02.920" style="s2">values can be derived with with with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.339" end="00:13:05.380" style="s2">unerring precision in some sense using</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.920" end="00:13:07.660" style="s2">the proper methodology from facts and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.380" end="00:13:09.250" style="s2">I believe that it&#39;s more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.660" end="00:13:11.230" style="s2">than that that there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.250" end="00:13:14.530" style="s2">intermediating structures and those are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.230" end="00:13:17.770" style="s2">really narrative in in their nature so</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.530" end="00:13:19.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a technical argument as well as</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.770" end="00:13:21.070" style="s2">a variety of sub arguments of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.480" end="00:13:25.030" style="s2">the relative role of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.070" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">religion and so forth but the outcome of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.030" end="00:13:30.640" style="s2">the debate about those issues is partly</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:34.030" style="s2">what people are coming to the talks to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.640" end="00:13:36.460" style="s2">see to to to determine what should the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.030" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">conclusions be but a much larger part</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.460" end="00:13:42.940" style="s2">perhaps is to in to observe and engage</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:45.610" style="s2">at least by proxy in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.940" end="00:13:47.950" style="s2">dialogue and that&#39;s more important</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.610" end="00:13:50.680" style="s2">because dialogue is the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.950" end="00:13:52.540" style="s2">complex problems are solved which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.680" end="00:13:54.280" style="s2">what makes me a free speech advocate</p>

<p begin="00:15:10.360" end="00:15:16.080" style="s2">is that we could come to an agreement</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.890" end="00:15:28.150" style="s2">reasonable proposition I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:29.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a proposition of fact and he claims</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.650" end="00:15:33.610" style="s2">it&#39;s fair enough then</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.040" end="00:15:42.370" style="s2">would be really good if our systems of</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.370" end="00:15:46.300" style="s2">do we have that&#39;s not error well we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.990" end="00:15:47.950" style="s2">facts we have objective facts I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.300" end="00:15:49.630" style="s2">look at the technology look at what</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.950" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve done with our science it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:15:53.200" end="00:15:56.830" style="s2">can ground the value structure in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.700" end="00:16:01.090" style="s2">facts it&#39;s like well that would be good</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.830" end="00:16:03.520" style="s2">if we could do it so and and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.090" end="00:16:05.320" style="s2">his his ethic let&#39;s say is an amalgam of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.520" end="00:16:07.930" style="s2">those two propositions and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.320" end="00:16:09.960" style="s2">his project is honorable and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.930" end="00:16:13.420" style="s2">think he&#39;s committed to it he also</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.960" end="00:16:16.390" style="s2">rightly is concerned with the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.420" end="00:16:21.000" style="s2">the Fundamentalist dangers of revealed</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.390" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">truth and so is very skeptical about</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:36.970" style="s2">religion yeah fair enough but his the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.780" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">mechanisms that he outlines to derive</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.970" end="00:16:42.220" style="s2">values from facts are insufficient in my</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:45.030" style="s2">estimation I don&#39;t think that his</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.220" end="00:16:48.850" style="s2">argument is sufficiently sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.030" end="00:16:50.830" style="s2">even though I don&#39;t doubt it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.850" end="00:16:54.580" style="s2">think that Sam is any less committed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.830" end="00:16:58.150" style="s2">an ethical good it&#39;s not obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.580" end="00:17:02.620" style="s2">that he is than I am you know and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.150" end="00:17:04.420" style="s2">argued and discussed fully in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.620" end="00:17:08.010" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned you know with</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.420" end="00:17:11.380" style="s2">the with the odd error because no one is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.010" end="00:17:13.329" style="s2">negotiating 100% all the time in good</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.380" end="00:17:17.020" style="s2">faith I mean that&#39;s a standard that no</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.329" end="00:17:18.579" style="s2">one can can this can achieve but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.020" end="00:17:20.709" style="s2">the discussions have been unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.579" end="00:17:22.270" style="s2">productive and and we&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.709" end="00:17:23.560" style="s2">certainly the crowds are responding I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.270" end="00:17:26.260" style="s2">don&#39;t think the crowds would have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.560" end="00:17:28.449" style="s2">engaged if Sam wouldn&#39;t be wouldn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.260" end="00:17:31.090" style="s2">discussing in good faith you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.449" end="00:17:33.220" style="s2">because the engagement is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.090" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">indication that a good faith discussion</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.220" end="00:17:37.990" style="s2">is is occurring otherwise it gets dull</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:39.310" style="s2">very very rapidly we&#39;ll see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.990" end="00:17:41.770" style="s2">when the videos are released</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.310" end="00:17:44.419" style="s2">and that will be in August once there</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.770" end="00:17:47.179" style="s2">the sound is edited and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.419" end="00:17:51.169" style="s2">people will have a public debate about</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.179" end="00:17:54.259" style="s2">how it how the discussion proceeded I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.169" end="00:17:56.299" style="s2">also think that each discussion built on</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.259" end="00:17:58.279" style="s2">the previous one and that we both ended</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.299" end="00:18:00.739" style="s2">up I think we both ended that more</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.279" end="00:18:02.869" style="s2">informed and more articulate than we</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.739" end="00:18:04.730" style="s2">started out so that&#39;s a good that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.869" end="00:18:06.109" style="s2">really good thing I certainly understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.730" end="00:18:11.269" style="s2">his arguments much better than I did</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.109" end="00:18:12.950" style="s2">well a year ago let&#39;s say and I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.269" end="00:18:14.869" style="s2">Eric Weinstein describe sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.950" end="00:18:17.690" style="s2">cultural moment as a kind of civil war</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.869" end="00:18:19.149" style="s2">within the left sort of extreme left and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.690" end="00:18:21.559" style="s2">then the sort of moderate soft left</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.149" end="00:18:23.720" style="s2">which are probably sort of the at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.559" end="00:18:27.289" style="s2">the dominating kind of paradigm in the</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.289" end="00:18:31.159" style="s2">progressive friends and what I see</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.109" end="00:18:33.859" style="s2">happening recently maybe in the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.159" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">couple of weeks is a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.859" end="00:18:40.399" style="s2">starting to grapple with your ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.340" end="00:18:42.369" style="s2">looking at lasting this question what</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.399" end="00:18:45.049" style="s2">can the left learn from Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.369" end="00:18:47.359" style="s2">which is which is a pretty new</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.049" end="00:18:51.220" style="s2">development because I saw a lot of kind</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.220" end="00:18:56.419" style="s2">personally contribute to that debate and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.950" end="00:18:57.830" style="s2">well debate you&#39;re interesting oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.419" end="00:19:01.659" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.830" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">no no doubt about it no doubt about it</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.600" end="00:19:21.499" style="s2">claim is it is not my claim I think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:37.460" style="s2">is at least 300 million years that our</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.230" end="00:20:54.649" style="s2">hierarchies are inevitable because we</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.940" end="00:20:56.630" style="s2">have to solve complex problems and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.649" end="00:20:58.460" style="s2">have to solve them socially and when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.630" end="00:21:01.100" style="s2">implement a solution to a complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.460" end="00:21:02.510" style="s2">problem socially you produce a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.100" end="00:21:04.399" style="s2">because some people are better at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.510" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">implementation than others so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.399" end="00:21:08.659" style="s2">hierarchy of competence and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:11.570" style="s2">a hierarchy of distribution of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.659" end="00:21:13.490" style="s2">Spoils and so and in both of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.570" end="00:21:15.950" style="s2">hierarchies you get a disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.490" end="00:21:18.200" style="s2">clumping of resources at the top and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.950" end="00:21:20.659" style="s2">dispossession at the bottom in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:25.010" style="s2">nature of hierarchies so what&#39;s the left</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.659" end="00:21:27.529" style="s2">for the left is to remind those who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.010" end="00:21:31.309" style="s2">benefiting from the hierarchies that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.529" end="00:21:33.830" style="s2">hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.309" end="00:21:36.980" style="s2">is the clumping of people at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.830" end="00:21:40.070" style="s2">and that that&#39;s an eternal cost and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.980" end="00:21:41.960" style="s2">not trivial and so that&#39;s what the left</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.070" end="00:21:44.779" style="s2">should be properly focused on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.960" end="00:21:46.549" style="s2">should be providing the voice of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.779" end="00:21:50.899" style="s2">who are dispossessed by hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.549" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">the right should be saying yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.899" end="00:21:55.399" style="s2">damn hierarchies are necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:58.580" style="s2">they&#39;re not only necessary but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.399" end="00:22:02.210" style="s2">also productive than the left says yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.580" end="00:22:04.279" style="s2">but they tilt towards tyranny and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.210" end="00:22:06.460" style="s2">can be occupied inappropriately by</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.279" end="00:22:08.570" style="s2">people who are playing games of power</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.460" end="00:22:10.789" style="s2">fair enough the right has to take that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.570" end="00:22:11.990" style="s2">into account the hierarchy can rigid</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.789" end="00:22:14.179" style="s2">rigidify</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.990" end="00:22:16.160" style="s2">and is likely to do that and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.179" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">taken over by people who are corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.160" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s likely to happen and so but but</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:23.570" style="s2">it&#39;s okay because the dialogue could</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:24.980" style="s2">work out the the right can say well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.570" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">we need the damn hierarchies and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.980" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">need to be but wrists and the left can</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">say yes but they have to be maintained</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:35.090" style="s2">properly so they don&#39;t deteriorate and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:37.010" style="s2">degenerate and and I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.090" end="00:22:38.600" style="s2">think that&#39;s ancient wisdom I think the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.010" end="00:22:42.140" style="s2">ancient Egyptians had figured that out</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.600" end="00:22:44.690" style="s2">in their symbolic representations so now</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.140" end="00:22:46.790" style="s2">when the left goes too far</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.690" end="00:22:48.770" style="s2">it does something like say well how</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.790" end="00:22:52.790" style="s2">about no hierarchies it&#39;s like no how</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:54.620" style="s2">about not wrong because all that happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.790" end="00:22:56.270" style="s2">if you flatten one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.620" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">happens if you flatten out the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.270" end="00:23:00.530" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t even organize your</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">perceptions you can&#39;t perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.530" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">without looking at the world through a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:07.250" style="s2">hierarchy of value and if because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:09.080" style="s2">can&#39;t perceive the world unless you make</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.250" end="00:23:10.280" style="s2">one thing more important than all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.080" end="00:23:12.530" style="s2">other things because you don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.280" end="00:23:13.940" style="s2">what to look at and if one thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.530" end="00:23:15.620" style="s2">more important than all the other things</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.940" end="00:23:16.850" style="s2">then you have nothing to aim at if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.620" end="00:23:19.070" style="s2">have nothing to aim at then you have no</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.850" end="00:23:21.080" style="s2">meaning in your life so the left can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.070" end="00:23:23.660" style="s2">just demolish the hierarchies in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.080" end="00:23:26.120" style="s2">name of some equality of outcome let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.660" end="00:23:28.790" style="s2">say because you blow out the future you</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.120" end="00:23:30.500" style="s2">leave people aimless and you destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.790" end="00:23:32.059" style="s2">very institutions that allow people to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.500" end="00:23:35.270" style="s2">make competent progress in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.059" end="00:23:39.170" style="s2">that&#39;s not an acceptable outcome so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.270" end="00:23:42.530" style="s2">have to we have to agree to live with</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.170" end="00:23:44.660" style="s2">the tension necessity for hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.530" end="00:23:48.050" style="s2">the proclivity for them to pathologize</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.660" end="00:23:49.850" style="s2">and the the necessary voice of the left</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.050" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">and speaking for thee for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.850" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">dispossessed so and I mean I&#39;ve as far</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:57.740" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned I&#39;ve said something</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:24:00.260" style="s2">approximating that through my entire</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.740" end="00:24:02.330" style="s2">career and so the fact that the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.260" end="00:24:06.020" style="s2">wingers have been irritated at me is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.330" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">well in some sense that&#39;s an inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.020" end="00:24:12.440" style="s2">consequence of me taking on the radical</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:16.160" style="s2">left wingers but it&#39;s also the refusal</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.440" end="00:24:19.820" style="s2">by the moderate left to deal with their</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.160" end="00:24:21.890" style="s2">internal problems and the sticking point</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.820" end="00:24:23.170" style="s2">that I hear a lot from my sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.890" end="00:24:25.059" style="s2">progressive friends is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.170" end="00:24:26.860" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of primary focus is on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.059" end="00:24:29.380" style="s2">individual yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.860" end="00:24:32.020" style="s2">bad for them because it should be you</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.380" end="00:24:35.140" style="s2">know I can agree with that but what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.020" end="00:24:37.780" style="s2">the the paradox that they would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.140" end="00:24:39.820" style="s2">like okay focus on the individual but</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.780" end="00:24:42.040" style="s2">you have to accept that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.820" end="00:24:43.809" style="s2">situations that are much more conducive</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.040" end="00:24:45.640" style="s2">to an individual thriving than other</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.809" end="00:24:47.710" style="s2">situations so their focus is on</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.640" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">structural inequality you&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.710" end="00:24:51.130" style="s2">the individual is there not some</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:53.260" style="s2">interplay between most definitely well</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.130" end="00:24:55.299" style="s2">obviously because people do have group</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.260" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">identities the question is whether</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.299" end="00:25:00.040" style="s2">whether the group or the individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:01.720" style="s2">identity should be paramount and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.040" end="00:25:04.630" style="s2">leftist stance the radical leftist</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.720" end="00:25:06.790" style="s2">answer is well there is the look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.630" end="00:25:08.650" style="s2">not me that&#39;s failing to take into</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.790" end="00:25:10.510" style="s2">account those two levels of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.650" end="00:25:12.970" style="s2">it&#39;s the bloody radical leftist because</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.510" end="00:25:16.600" style="s2">for them it&#39;s the collective and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.970" end="00:25:18.760" style="s2">that and so it&#39;s obvious as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.600" end="00:25:20.830" style="s2">concerned that people have their</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.760" end="00:25:22.660" style="s2">individuality and then behind that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.830" end="00:25:24.610" style="s2">have their they have their group like</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.660" end="00:25:27.160" style="s2">multiple group identities which is also</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.610" end="00:25:28.660" style="s2">a big problem but also over today or any</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.160" end="00:25:29.770" style="s2">of these situations that make it much</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.660" end="00:25:32.169" style="s2">more difficult for people to self</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.770" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">actualize well what I think they&#39;d argue</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.169" end="00:25:34.510" style="s2">is they don&#39;t hear you talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:35.980" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.510" end="00:25:38.380" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t first of all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.980" end="00:25:40.210" style="s2">self-evident like I&#39;m not I don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.380" end="00:25:42.280" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.210" end="00:25:43.480" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessarily more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.280" end="00:25:44.290" style="s2">for people who are poor to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.480" end="00:25:47.020" style="s2">self-actualize</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.290" end="00:25:48.490" style="s2">sorry I don&#39;t buy that is because what</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.020" end="00:25:50.679" style="s2">that would mean think about what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.490" end="00:25:53.380" style="s2">would mean that would mean that the rich</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.679" end="00:25:55.390" style="s2">are morally superior that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.380" end="00:25:57.040" style="s2">means because they have all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.390" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">opportunities to self actualize so</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.040" end="00:26:01.390" style="s2">obviously if the material conditions are</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.590" end="00:26:03.309" style="s2">the prerequisite for self-actualization</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.390" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">then the rich are morally superior to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.309" end="00:26:07.809" style="s2">the poor is that really an argument we</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:09.610" style="s2">want to make and then in fact I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.809" end="00:26:11.830" style="s2">think that that&#39;s even even vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.610" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">reasonable because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.830" end="00:26:15.160" style="s2">that does help build character is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:19.620" style="s2">privation</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.160" end="00:26:21.640" style="s2">now obviously starving to death is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.620" end="00:26:26.140" style="s2">excess of privation</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.640" end="00:26:28.630" style="s2">so there are limit conditions but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.140" end="00:26:30.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a leftist trope that the provision</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.630" end="00:26:32.710" style="s2">of additional material resources will</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.730" end="00:26:33.490" style="s2">produce ethically superior human beings</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.710" end="00:26:36.540" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.490" end="00:26:40.800" style="s2">not true and in fact sometimes quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.540" end="00:26:43.610" style="s2">contrary so so so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.800" end="00:26:46.350" style="s2">don&#39;t buy that argument in the least I</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.610" end="00:26:49.470" style="s2">also think that under most circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.350" end="00:26:51.930" style="s2">in accepting those of exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.470" end="00:26:56.310" style="s2">privation and even perhaps under those</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.930" end="00:26:59.370" style="s2">conditions in most is in most cases your</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.900" end="00:28:46.040" style="s2">mean you look at the opioid crisis and</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.870" end="00:29:02.670" style="s2">if if poverty was caused by lack of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.030" end="00:29:05.730" style="s2">money hmm we could fix it really easily</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.670" end="00:29:07.320" style="s2">there but my point I think is to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.730" end="00:29:09.030" style="s2">that if if you were framing your message</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.320" end="00:29:10.230" style="s2">in that way I think there would be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.030" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">of people on the left</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.230" end="00:29:14.700" style="s2">who&#39;d be receptive to that message sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:18.150" style="s2">of that that actually there is a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.700" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">of that the crisis of already call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.150" end="00:29:22.260" style="s2">like worldview has real consequences and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">a lot of poverty we&#39;re seeing in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.260" end="00:29:25.640" style="s2">world is to do with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:29.280" style="s2">materialist worldview that has become</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.640" end="00:29:30.570" style="s2">become corrupt or at least kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.280" end="00:29:32.460" style="s2">stripped all of the meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.570" end="00:29:35.460" style="s2">oh yeah well that&#39;s a good point well</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.460" end="00:29:38.850" style="s2">right well I mean I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.460" end="00:29:41.490" style="s2">materialism materialist hedonism is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.850" end="00:29:44.160" style="s2">sufficient solution now it&#39;s a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.490" end="00:29:47.550" style="s2">complicated than that because I do think</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.160" end="00:29:50.670" style="s2">that functional democratic systems are</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.550" end="00:29:53.150" style="s2">actually pretty good at reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.670" end="00:29:56.850" style="s2">hedonism like I&#39;m pretty happy that our</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.150" end="00:29:58.620" style="s2">system produces a variety of toothpastes</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.850" end="00:30:00.690" style="s2">and a variety of toilet papers and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.620" end="00:30:03.480" style="s2">variety of sanitary napkins all of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.690" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">things that that are basically oriented</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.480" end="00:30:07.830" style="s2">towards what would you call them</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:09.530" style="s2">individual creature comforts there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.830" end="00:30:13.290" style="s2">something about that that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.530" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">merciful and properly egalitarian and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.290" end="00:30:18.630" style="s2">a certain degree of material hedonism is</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:22.890" style="s2">a good thing right because it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.630" end="00:30:26.370" style="s2">that people can have their basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.890" end="00:30:29.070" style="s2">taken care of in a dignified manner but</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.060" end="00:31:21.500" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that that&#39;s a core message</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.530" end="00:31:23.300" style="s2">certainly not of the radical left it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.500" end="00:31:26.180" style="s2">not that at all because generally they</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.300" end="00:31:29.420" style="s2">construe the individual as either the</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.410" end="00:31:43.640" style="s2">each of us can be subdivided into so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.020" end="00:31:45.740" style="s2">many group identities that there&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.640" end="00:31:48.440" style="s2">least one dimension along which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.740" end="00:31:50.990" style="s2">all oppressors and that&#39;s actually when</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.440" end="00:31:53.780" style="s2">I&#39;d be looking at what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.990" end="00:31:57.710" style="s2">aftermath of the Russian Revolution that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.780" end="00:31:59.750" style="s2">was the bloody error so to speak because</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.710" end="00:32:03.410" style="s2">you could take virtually every any</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.750" end="00:32:05.150" style="s2">individual and you could find out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.410" end="00:32:07.310" style="s2">like if there&#39;s one dimension of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.150" end="00:32:09.770" style="s2">identity that makes you an oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.310" end="00:32:12.650" style="s2">that trumps all the elements of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.770" end="00:32:14.090" style="s2">identity where you&#39;re a victim and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.650" end="00:32:15.650" style="s2">problem with that is there is one</p>

<p begin="00:32:15.650" end="00:32:20.690" style="s2">oppressor and so that&#39;s sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.380" end="00:32:22.520" style="s2">justification to throw you in with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.690" end="00:32:25.100" style="s2">Predators and do whatever is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.520" end="00:32:26.900" style="s2">to dispense with you and that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.100" end="00:32:28.580" style="s2">what happened in the aftermath all not</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.580" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2">of these radical leftist revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.920" end="00:32:36.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like well if you&#39;re a socialist</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.150" end="00:32:54.380" style="s2">and on and on and on there wasn&#39;t</p>
