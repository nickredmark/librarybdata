<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:38.040" style="s2">You know, when a computer starts up, it has<br />to boot – bootstrap, is what that means.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.040" end="00:00:43.540" style="s2">And that boot straps itself by continuing<br />to engage in more and more complex processes</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.540" end="00:00:44.630" style="s2">as it starts up.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.630" end="00:00:48.860" style="s2">So, it starts up with a simple process, and<br />that triggers a more complex process.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.860" end="00:00:53.040" style="s2">And that triggers a more complex process,<br />and that way, the computer boots itself into</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.040" end="00:00:54.040" style="s2">existence.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.040" end="00:00:58.040" style="s2">Well, that’s exactly what we did, except<br />we did it over like three billion years, right?</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.040" end="00:01:02.610" style="s2">We started out as these unbelievably simple<br />organisms that can pretty much do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.610" end="00:01:09.860" style="s2">at all, except replicate and develop much<br />more and more complex forms over this tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.860" end="00:01:12.280" style="s2">long period of evolutionary history, right?</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.280" end="00:01:17.000" style="s2">So, that’s how we solved the problem that<br />you can’t know anything without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.000" end="00:01:20.440" style="s2">something, and that you can’t have knowledge<br />without generating it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.440" end="00:01:22.430" style="s2">It’s: A little knowledge, a little more<br />generation.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.430" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">A little knowledge, a little more generation.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">A little knowledge-- this huge spiraling process<br />that expends-- extends over vast amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:35.380" style="s2">time; information encoded in your body, right,<br />and as part of your-- as part of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.380" end="00:01:40.080" style="s2">of your being; and information encoded in<br />your culture, reflected inside, you enacted</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.080" end="00:01:46.520" style="s2">out in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.520" end="00:01:53.630" style="s2">And as scientists, you know, with this 500-year<br />history of science behind us, we always believe</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.630" end="00:01:57.590" style="s2">that it’s the material substrate of things<br />that’s the reality.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.590" end="00:02:02.330" style="s2">But it is more complicated than that, because<br />even the material substrate that we consider</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.330" end="00:02:07.000" style="s2">as scientists isn’t merely unformed stuff,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.000" end="00:02:08.240" style="s2">It has structure.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.240" end="00:02:09.240" style="s2">It’s patterned.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.240" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">It’s full of information, and there are<br />physicists working now who believe that conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">of the ground of being – the material ground<br />uh, of being – as information is a more</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:26.140" style="s2">fruitful metaphor than conceptualization of<br />the ground of being as like unformed matter.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.140" end="00:02:28.100" style="s2">It’s not unformed, right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.100" end="00:02:30.070" style="s2">It’s patterned and regular.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.070" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">Informative so that if you investigate it,<br />it reveals order as not just a material structure.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:40.580" style="s2">So, if you go back to Democratus, right, the<br />person who originated the atomic hypothesis,</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.580" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">Democratus actually says two things – not<br />one.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:47.080" style="s2">He says: Everything’s made out of atoms<br />– little bits of stuff.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.080" end="00:02:52.849" style="s2">But the other thing he says is: Atoms array<br />themselves in space array themselves-- And</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.849" end="00:02:57.959" style="s2">what that means is that the atomic structure<br />of things is patterned, and that the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.959" end="00:03:00.590" style="s2">is just as real as the atoms themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.590" end="00:03:02.360" style="s2">It’s the pattern that’s the knowledge,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.360" end="00:03:07.190" style="s2">It’s the pattern that’s the information.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.190" end="00:03:15.940" style="s2">So, what we encounter as conscious beings<br />is this complexly patterned array, which we</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.940" end="00:03:18.520" style="s2">then turn into knowledge – useable knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.520" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">I said: Well, how would this metaphorical<br />representation work?</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:27.260" style="s2">And so uh, the way I want you to look at this<br />figure is like this: Imagine this as distant,</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.260" end="00:03:29.110" style="s2">right, as lurking in the background.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.110" end="00:03:36.600" style="s2">So, this is the ground of all being manifesting<br />itself as one primordial archetype, or one,</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.600" end="00:03:41.849" style="s2">one metaph-- one standard motive metaphorical<br />representation.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.849" end="00:03:42.849" style="s2">Why this figure?</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.849" end="00:03:46.379" style="s2">Well, this is complicated, I think.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.379" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">If you show men a picture of a beautiful woman<br />with her eyes averted, while you’re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:03:58.980" style="s2">a brain scan mapping of their nucleus accumbens,<br />nothing happens.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.980" end="00:04:00.190" style="s2">Why is that relevant?</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.190" end="00:04:04.849" style="s2">Well, the nucleus accumbens is part of the<br />underlying emotional circuitry that governs</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.849" end="00:04:07.250" style="s2">approach behaviour and pleasure.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.250" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">And approach behaviour and pleasure are very<br />tightly intertwined.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">If you show the same man a picture of a beautiful<br />woman with her eyes locked on his, his nucleus</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:16.910" style="s2">accumbens will light up.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.910" end="00:04:18.019" style="s2">Why is that?</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.019" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">Well, it’s partly because men are innately<br />in-- attuned to hu-- to female beauty.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:25.849" style="s2">Female beauty has a standard form.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.849" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">It’s replicable cross-culturally.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:32.620" style="s2">It constitutes the average human… human<br />female form.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.620" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">But more than that, the gaze-locking is an<br />indication of shared attention.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:42.180" style="s2">And it’s also the indication of the initial<br />establishment of a shared attentional space.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.180" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">And it’s an invitation, and that invitation<br />activates approach circuitry, even if it’s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:47.690" style="s2">just a picture.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.690" end="00:04:52.169" style="s2">So, and you can see this if you walk into<br />any drug store, or any-any s-- any drug store</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.169" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">that sells magazines.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">What do you see?</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.500" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">Well, in the men’s magazines, you see an<br />infinite array of beautiful women.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.260" style="s2">And in the female magazines, the women’s<br />magazines, you see an infinite array of beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.260" end="00:05:04.260" style="s2">women.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.260" end="00:05:05.810" style="s2">Now, just exactly why is that?</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.810" end="00:05:09.740" style="s2">Well, there’s something absolutely compelling<br />about female beauty.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.740" end="00:05:13.450" style="s2">And then, you have to ask yourself: What the<br />hell does compelling mean?</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.450" end="00:05:20.440" style="s2">OK, so what compelling means is: You’re<br />busily engaged in a goal-directed task and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.440" end="00:05:25.850" style="s2">something happens in your peripheral vision,<br />so to speak, that attracts your attention.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.850" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">Now, that attention is attracted by processes<br />that are fundamentally unconscious; which</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.170" style="s2">means, processes that occur before you can<br />think.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.170" end="00:05:42.590" style="s2">So, you can imagine a loose collection of<br />college-aged males having a conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.590" end="00:05:45.669" style="s2">a bar, when someone beautiful walks by.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.669" end="00:05:50.279" style="s2">And one or more of them catch her out of the<br />corner of their eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.279" end="00:05:52.010" style="s2">Orientation, right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.010" end="00:05:53.010" style="s2">Unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.010" end="00:05:54.010" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.010" end="00:05:58.870" style="s2">Because there’s something about that pattern<br />form that grips attentional systems and directs</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.870" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">observation towards it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:07.050" style="s2">So then, you think: OK.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.050" end="00:06:10.950" style="s2">Human beings are really, really complicated<br />pattern processors.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.950" end="00:06:14.940" style="s2">And you think: Well, partly what we’re trying<br />to get a handle on here is the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.940" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">world.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:19.669" style="s2">And partly what we know already is that there<br />are aspects of the world that you can’t</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.669" end="00:06:21.630" style="s2">understand always.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.630" end="00:06:26.120" style="s2">And then, you think: Well, people are trying<br />to get a grip on the fact that there are parts</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.120" end="00:06:27.420" style="s2">of the world that you can’t understand.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.420" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">So, that there’s this transcendant element<br />to being that always escapes encapsulation.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:34.510" style="s2">How would you represent it?</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.510" end="00:06:40.469" style="s2">Well, it’s the transcendent element of things<br />that always attracts your attention, implicitly,</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.469" end="00:06:41.729" style="s2">beyond your control.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.729" end="00:06:49.770" style="s2">So, loud noise or a scream, or the cry of<br />a baby or anything horrific, right?</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.770" end="00:06:54.440" style="s2">Blood, broken bodies…</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.440" end="00:07:01.810" style="s2">These are stimuli that are so representative<br />of trouble that you can’t help but attend</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.810" end="00:07:03.159" style="s2">to them.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.159" end="00:07:08.820" style="s2">And then, you can imagine that all the stimuli,<br />so to speak, that you can’t help but attend</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.820" end="00:07:16.570" style="s2">to, can be amalgamated into representations<br />of… the transcendent aspect of reality.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.570" end="00:07:19.900" style="s2">And that’s what you see in this representation<br />right here.</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.900" end="00:07:29.240" style="s2">So, you see a weird intermingling of female<br />sexuality, plus some very distinct genital</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.240" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">symbolism.</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:31.240" style="s2">Why genital?</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.240" end="00:07:36.140" style="s2">So, imagine that that’s a vulval opening.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.140" end="00:07:37.140" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.140" end="00:07:41.530" style="s2">Before we had any scientific knowledge at<br />all-- let’s go 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.530" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">What the hell’s inside a body?</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.500" style="s2">Well, we knew that, I guess, a little bit<br />from hunting, right?</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.500" end="00:07:48.320" style="s2">We knew the interior of a body.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.320" end="00:07:51.830" style="s2">What is it about the interior of a body that<br />allows new forms to be generated?</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.830" end="00:07:54.750" style="s2">How is it that mothers can give birth to children?</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.750" end="00:07:59.349" style="s2">How is it that one form, that’s complex<br />and attractive and mysterious, can give rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.349" end="00:08:00.850" style="s2">to another form?</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.850" end="00:08:05.419" style="s2">Why is that useful knowledge from a representational<br />perspective?</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.419" end="00:08:10.419" style="s2">Because there’s some association between<br />the feminine form from a metaphorical perspective,</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.419" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">and the capacity for nature to give rise to<br />new forms.</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:21.870" style="s2">And then you see a representation of a typical<br />monstrous form that’s Kali the Hindu goddess</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.870" end="00:08:29.630" style="s2">the devourer and in this representation so<br />she’s like a more developed version of Tiamat</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.630" end="00:08:32.330" style="s2">that’s a good way of thinking about her.</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.330" end="00:08:38.200" style="s2">She&#39;s not so much unspeakable anymore, you<br />can actually say a few things about Kali,</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.200" end="00:08:43.060" style="s2">you could say well she’s like a spider because<br />she has 8 legs and she weaves a web of fate</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.060" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">and you could say well her web is made out<br />of fire because if you get too near to her</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:48.839" style="s2">you&#39;ll burn up.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.839" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">And you could say she glares at you with eyes<br />that are unblinking and you could say she</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:59.320" style="s2">has a tongue like a tiger and you could say<br />that she carries weapons of destruction and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.320" end="00:09:02.930" style="s2">has a headdress of skulls and that her hair<br />is on fire.</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.930" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">And you could say that she’s giving birth<br />to this guy as nature gives birth to human</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:10.970" style="s2">beings and is devouring him at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.970" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">Intestines first.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:19.889" style="s2">And then you could say well you could imagine<br />that the first few people that made a representation</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.889" end="00:09:26.150" style="s2">like that shocked themselves quite badly,<br />right because this is a this is a representation</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.150" end="00:09:32.779" style="s2">of fear itself in a sense not exactly it’s<br />also a representation of those stimuli that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.779" end="00:09:38.490" style="s2">if you&#39;re human are going to make you both<br />afraid and compelled just like it’s hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.490" end="00:09:48.860" style="s2">to look away from fire even if it’s burning<br />something down, you want to have it around.</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.860" end="00:09:55.370" style="s2">Rats if you raise a rat to juvenile status<br />and then waft in cat odour it will completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:09:58.339" style="s2">short circuit, why?</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.339" end="00:10:03.170" style="s2">Well the rat’s never seen a cat so exactly<br />what the hell is it responding to you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.170" end="00:10:07.260" style="s2">well you could say well it’s not a conditioned<br />stimulus because the rat’s never encountered</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.260" end="00:10:12.870" style="s2">a cat there&#39;s something deep in the brain<br />of that rat that knows something about cat</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.870" end="00:10:19.129" style="s2">odour has never encountered a cat so exactly<br />what is it perceiving well in some sense I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.129" end="00:10:24.120" style="s2">think the notion that it’s perceiving is<br />wrong it isn&#39;t perceiving, it’s just going</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.120" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">like this.</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:26.949" style="s2">That’s the representation.</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.949" end="00:10:31.880" style="s2">Well with chimpanzees who are more complex<br />there are other stimuli that evoke exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:34.810" style="s2">that kind of response chimps don’t like<br />snakes.</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.810" end="00:10:39.980" style="s2">Dead or alive plastic rubber doesn’t matter<br />they don’t like snakes if you put one in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.980" end="00:10:43.819" style="s2">their cage they get as far away from the snake<br />as they can as quickly as possible and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.819" end="00:10:45.100" style="s2">they look at it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.100" end="00:10:48.680" style="s2">Because I suppose if you&#39;re a chimpanzee even<br />if you don’t like snakes it’s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.680" end="00:10:55.629" style="s2">to know where they are right so it’s simultaneously<br />repelling -- Ahh snake! -- plus attractive</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.629" end="00:10:58.830" style="s2">well you better look at it and see where it’s<br />gonna go.</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.830" end="00:11:04.620" style="s2">Chimpanzees don’t like unconscious chimpanzees<br />so if you knock a chimpanzee out with anesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.620" end="00:11:08.930" style="s2">and you bring the body of the chimpanzee back<br />into the chimpanzee cage the chimps do exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.930" end="00:11:13.720" style="s2">the same thing away from the body but they<br />look at it they don’t like masks made of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.720" end="00:11:14.899" style="s2">chimpanzee faces.</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.899" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">Well 3 year old kids don’t like masks either.</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:24.439" style="s2">there are these underlying perceptual primitive<br />so to speak that likely activate lower limbic</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.439" end="00:11:33.250" style="s2">mechanisms in our brains that say to us this<br />is a place suddenly where something that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.250" end="00:11:38.649" style="s2">probably do not like or will not like is very<br />very likely to happen so you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.649" end="00:11:45.550" style="s2">an environment characterized by unconscious<br />bodies or blood or the presence of spiders</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.550" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">or snakes etcetera might be a place where<br />a primate such as yourself may encounter things</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:56.210" style="s2">that they don’t know how to cope with therefore<br />afraid, right same with fear of the dark,</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.210" end="00:12:00.741" style="s2">and then you can imagine that the dark is<br />populated with all of these monsters of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.741" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">unknown and you get some notion of what&#39;s<br />happening to children who are afraid of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:06.920" style="s2">dark, why are they afraid of the dark.</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.920" end="00:12:12.029" style="s2">Because in the dark which is the place you<br />don’t know lurk things that could hurt a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.029" end="00:12:13.460" style="s2">creature like you.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.460" end="00:12:14.529" style="s2">What things.</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.529" end="00:12:20.569" style="s2">Well we can’t exactly say, but if you give<br />children exposure to books and to adult conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.569" end="00:12:26.670" style="s2">and the television soon those limbic structures<br />that are populating the darkness with unnamable</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.670" end="00:12:33.140" style="s2">fear start to populate it up with skeletons<br />and vampires and monsters and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.140" end="00:12:34.300" style="s2">so on.</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.300" end="00:12:40.529" style="s2">the representational structures that the brain<br />is capable of generating say well fear-inducing</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.529" end="00:12:44.839" style="s2">things are like that they&#39;re bloody they&#39;re<br />dangerous they look like serpents they look</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.839" end="00:12:50.310" style="s2">like insects they lurk in the dark they sneak<br />up on you etc. all mangled together into some</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.310" end="00:12:53.769" style="s2">sort of monstrous form.</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.769" end="00:12:58.589" style="s2">Now I wanna read you a story.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.589" end="00:13:02.839" style="s2">So lemme give you a little background on this<br />story.</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.839" end="00:13:07.779" style="s2">This story popped into my head in one chunk<br />like complete which I thought was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.779" end="00:13:14.220" style="s2">interesting but… it was also a story that<br />emerged in solution to a problem I’d been</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.220" end="00:13:17.949" style="s2">thinking about for a long time because I was<br />dealing with this guy who didn&#39;t wanna grow</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.949" end="00:13:24.010" style="s2">up, so he’s caught in a kind of Peter Pan<br />situation and Peter Pan, pan means everything,</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.010" end="00:13:26.069" style="s2">pan like pantheistic.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.069" end="00:13:30.459" style="s2">And Peter Pan is a child who won’t grow<br />up now he’s magical well okay fine children</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.459" end="00:13:34.519" style="s2">live in the magical world right they&#39;re ripe<br />with possibility, he’s magical.</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.519" end="00:13:37.350" style="s2">He doesn’t wanna grow up.</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.350" end="00:13:41.580" style="s2">So he lives in Neverland with the lost boys,<br />Neverland doesn’t really exist and the lost</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.580" end="00:13:47.290" style="s2">boys are obviously boys who haven&#39;t managed<br />to establish some mode of being and he’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.290" end="00:13:53.470" style="s2">in constant battle with Capt. Hook and Capt.<br />Hook’s a tyrant right a pirate a negative</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.470" end="00:13:56.999" style="s2">a manifestation of the negative archetype<br />of social order.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.999" end="00:14:02.649" style="s2">Hook is always fighting Peter Pan because<br />Peter Pan represents childhood and vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.649" end="00:14:06.339" style="s2">and he doesn’t wanna be vulnerable so they&#39;re<br />locked in this sort of eternal battle.</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.339" end="00:14:14.949" style="s2">and lots of people I think more commonly men<br />but not necessarily, get caught in this Peter</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.949" end="00:14:16.649" style="s2">Pan problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.649" end="00:14:24.060" style="s2">So I was dealing with a person who was caught<br />in this situation didn&#39;t wanna grow up wouldn’t</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.060" end="00:14:27.269" style="s2">sacrifice childhood.</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.269" end="00:14:29.290" style="s2">And so this story popped into my head.</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">It’s called Cockadoodledo</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:35.999" style="s2">Once upon a time there was a man who had a<br />long hard journey ahead of him.</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.999" end="00:14:39.879" style="s2">He was trudging along the way over waters<br />and through brushes when he saw little shiny</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.879" end="00:14:44.839" style="s2">gnome with big white teeth and a black toupee<br />sitting by the side of the road.</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.839" end="00:14:46.660" style="s2">He was drumming on a log.</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.660" end="00:14:49.379" style="s2">With two white bones and humming oddly to<br />himself.</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.379" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">The little gnome said John, why work so hard<br />why walk so fast.</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:57.639" style="s2">Who knows if you&#39;ll ever get there anyway.</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.639" end="00:15:00.819" style="s2">Come over here I have something to show you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.819" end="00:15:02.490" style="s2">So John walked off the road.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.490" end="00:15:06.930" style="s2">He was sick of walking anyway because people<br />kept throwing sticks and stones at him.</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.930" end="00:15:12.130" style="s2">Little gnome said I have a shiny red jewel<br />that I would like to sell you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.130" end="00:15:13.230" style="s2">Cheap.</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.230" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">Here it is.</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.910" style="s2">And from beneath his cloak he pulled the biggest<br />ruby that the man had ever seen.</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.910" end="00:15:23.430" style="s2">Must’ve weighed 100 pounds and shone like<br />the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.430" end="00:15:25.470" style="s2">The gnome said, do you like it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.470" end="00:15:29.949" style="s2">It’s an enchanted stone, what will you offer<br />me for it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.949" end="00:15:30.949" style="s2">And the man said.</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.949" end="00:15:35.220" style="s2">I don’t have much, much money but I’ll<br />give you everything I have.</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.220" end="00:15:37.579" style="s2">And the gnome looked displeased.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.579" end="00:15:41.389" style="s2">So John added I could pay some more monthly.</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.389" end="00:15:46.670" style="s2">So the gnome accepted, fair enough buy now<br />pay later, sounds good for me, I&#39;m all for</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.670" end="00:15:49.000" style="s2">the installment plan.</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.000" end="00:15:52.740" style="s2">So the man gave the gnome all his money and<br />promised to pay the rest later and the gnome</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.740" end="00:15:57.779" style="s2">walked back into the bush by the road clacking<br />his teeth and giggling and twitching.</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.779" end="00:16:02.839" style="s2">The more the man thought about this ruby and<br />the great deal he got the happier he became,</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.839" end="00:16:06.459" style="s2">he started back on the road with a light heart<br />but soon discovered that he couldn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.459" end="00:16:10.230" style="s2">much progress because 100 pounds was a lot<br />to carry.</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.230" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">He said to himself why continue anyways I<br />have what I want, I’ll just stand here holding</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:20.529" style="s2">my ruby and when people walk by they could<br />see how well I&#39;ve all ready done.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.529" end="00:16:22.059" style="s2">So he stopped.</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.059" end="00:16:25.649" style="s2">A little while one of his little while later<br />one of his friends came along saw him standing</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.649" end="00:16:26.649" style="s2">there.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.649" end="00:16:30.180" style="s2">His friend said John why don’t you come<br />along with me.</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.180" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve just opened a new business and I could<br />really use some help, come along quick.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:37.100" style="s2">It will be opening soon.</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.100" end="00:16:38.499" style="s2">John thought that sounded good.</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.499" end="00:16:40.319" style="s2">But his friend was in a hurry.</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.319" end="00:16:42.939" style="s2">Besides couldn&#39;t he see the ruby?</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.939" end="00:16:47.149" style="s2">How could he speed along beside him where<br />would he put his jewel.</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.149" end="00:16:49.240" style="s2">So he said thanks but I have to take care<br />of my jewel.</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.240" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">Maybe I’ll see you later.</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">His friend looked at him like he was crazy<br />but he was trying to get somewhere quick so</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:59.060" style="s2">he just shrugged a bit and said okay John<br />see you later.</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.060" end="00:17:01.230" style="s2">And he sped on down the road.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.230" end="00:17:04.660" style="s2">Little while later another friend came by<br />and he said John nice to see you.</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.660" end="00:17:05.809" style="s2">I&#39;m going back to school.</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.809" end="00:17:09.750" style="s2">There are lots of wonderful things to learn,<br />great things to do.</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.750" end="00:17:11.800" style="s2">The world is full of unsolved problems.</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.800" end="00:17:13.490" style="s2">I could use some company.</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.490" end="00:17:15.640" style="s2">Would you like to come along.</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.640" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">John thought that sounded pretty good but<br />this friend too looked like he was in a hurry.</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:23.160" style="s2">Besides standing beside the road holding the<br />jewel was tiring and he needed all the energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.160" end="00:17:24.660" style="s2">he had for that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.660" end="00:17:28.700" style="s2">So he said to his friend thanks but I have<br />to take care of my jewel.</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.700" end="00:17:31.870" style="s2">Isn&#39;t it beautiful maybe I’ll see you later.</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.870" end="00:17:35.660" style="s2">His friend looked at him like he was crazy<br />but he was trying to get somewhere quick so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.660" end="00:17:42.340" style="s2">he just shrugged and said hope everything<br />goes all right with you, see you later.</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.340" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">Many friends came and went and the years went<br />by.</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">The jewel got heavier and heavier.</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:49.300" style="s2">But the man got more and more attached to<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.300" end="00:17:53.140" style="s2">The only thing was nobody seemed to notice<br />how beautiful it was.</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.140" end="00:17:57.770" style="s2">People would rush by and talk about their<br />plans and nobody had a ruby as big and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.770" end="00:18:03.100" style="s2">seemed likely to get a ruby as big if you&#39;d<br />think that someone might have said something</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.100" end="00:18:09.990" style="s2">like at least nice ruby John sure wish I had<br />one like that but it never happened.</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.990" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">Then one day someone new came down the road,<br />he was bent over and he was thin and his hair</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:16.460" style="s2">was gray, although he didn&#39;t look that old.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.460" end="00:18:21.620" style="s2">He was carrying a big dirty rock carefully<br />in his arms and he wasn’t making much progress.</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.620" end="00:18:26.539" style="s2">The strange figure approached and glanced<br />up at John, then he grinned and said, why</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.539" end="00:18:30.990" style="s2">are you standing there so stupidly with a<br />big ugly rock in your tired old hands.</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.990" end="00:18:32.150" style="s2">You look pretty daft.</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.150" end="00:18:37.059" style="s2">I bet you wish you had a big ruby like the<br />one I&#39;m carrying and John thought this poor</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.059" end="00:18:40.540" style="s2">man is deluded, he’s carrying a rock.</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.540" end="00:18:44.520" style="s2">I have the ruby so he said excuse me sir but<br />you were sadly mistaken.</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.520" end="00:18:48.860" style="s2">I&#39;m the one with the jewel I met a little<br />gnome by the side of the road and he sold</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.860" end="00:18:49.860" style="s2">it to me.</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.860" end="00:18:52.530" style="s2">I’m still paying for it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.530" end="00:18:56.550" style="s2">Although not so very much, you are carrying<br />a rock.</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.550" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">The tired stranger looked annoyed said I don&#39;t<br />know what game you&#39;re playing mister you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:03.220" style="s2">a rock I have a jewel.</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.220" end="00:19:05.340" style="s2">Little gnome you described sold it to me.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.340" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">And he said it was the only one.</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:09.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve been carrying it for 20 years.</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.750" end="00:19:11.870" style="s2">And I’ll never let it go.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.870" end="00:19:16.870" style="s2">And John said but I&#39;m been carrying mine for<br />20 years too, it can’t be just a rock.</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.870" end="00:19:19.920" style="s2">Rock or jewel on and on they argued.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.920" end="00:19:22.809" style="s2">Suddenly out stepped the little gnome as if<br />he’d never left.</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.809" end="00:19:26.590" style="s2">Only this time he wasn’t so little he was<br />bigger and redder and menacing and his laugh</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.590" end="00:19:29.730" style="s2">sounded like the rattling of chains.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.730" end="00:19:31.470" style="s2">Quit arguing you two.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.470" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve never seen a sight quite so pathetic.</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">You&#39;re carrying rocks, both of you.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:41.000" style="s2">And if you would&#39;ve ever had the sense to<br />put them down for a second or two you would&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.000" end="00:19:42.210" style="s2">seen that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.210" end="00:19:44.700" style="s2">Oh well at least you were diligent.</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.700" end="00:19:46.529" style="s2">I played a mean trick.</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.529" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">I feel bad.</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:51.190" style="s2">So I&#39;m gonna give you what you really deserve.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.190" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">Do you want what you really deserve?</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:19:59.370" style="s2">And John and the thin stranger nodded eagerly,<br />finally they thought.</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.370" end="00:20:01.610" style="s2">You haven&#39;t seen anything yet.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.610" end="00:20:03.460" style="s2">Throw down your rocks.</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.460" end="00:20:05.929" style="s2">So John and the thin stranger obeyed.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.929" end="00:20:10.899" style="s2">Each rock split down the middle and it hit<br />the ground, out flowed a river of ravenous</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.899" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">white worms which rushed towards the men and<br />devoured them whole while they thrashed about</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:18.190" style="s2">and screamed.</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.190" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">Soon nothing was left except a legbone from<br />each.</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:25.650" style="s2">The little gnome picked them up and walked<br />off the road.</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.650" end="00:20:28.779" style="s2">He sat down by a hollow log and started to<br />drum.</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.779" end="00:20:30.899" style="s2">He drummed and he waited.</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.899" end="00:20:34.860" style="s2">And he hummed an odd little tune.</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.860" end="00:20:40.890" style="s2">Picture of food feeds the whole hungry clan,<br />the image of good makes the whole healthy</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.890" end="00:20:50.519" style="s2">man, why walk for miles why do the work, just<br />smile the smile, success after all is a quirk,</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.519" end="00:20:53.320" style="s2">life isn&#39;t real that’s the message I give.</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.320" end="00:21:03.550" style="s2">It’s easy that way, plus who wants to live?</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.550" end="00:21:08.200" style="s2">So needless to say the guy that I was telling<br />this story to never listened to it and things</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.200" end="00:21:12.850" style="s2">really didn&#39;t go well for him for a long,<br />long time, and they really didn&#39;t go well</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.850" end="00:21:17.610" style="s2">for him until he was willing to give up some<br />of the things he was carrying along so he</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.610" end="00:21:23.190" style="s2">had acquired for example a number of things<br />that he couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.190" end="00:21:27.500" style="s2">And the fact that he was carrying them right<br />paying for them month after month, meant couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.500" end="00:21:32.370" style="s2">afford to get an education was perfectly willing<br />to sacrifice the possibility of getting an</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.370" end="00:21:35.350" style="s2">education for the image of success.</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.350" end="00:21:40.690" style="s2">Rather than the reverse right and he was completely<br />irritated at the world because he had all</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.690" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">these trappings of success which no one he<br />admired also admired and he absolutely wasn’t</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:50.360" style="s2">getting anywhere and he thought that was tremendously<br />unfair.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.360" end="00:21:55.149" style="s2">But the truth of the matter was that had he<br />put down what he was carrying for even a moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.149" end="00:21:57.990" style="s2">and he would&#39;ve been able to get to where<br />he wanted to go.</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.990" end="00:22:10.670" style="s2">And that’s a motif that succinctly and dramatically<br />describes the necessity for sacrifice.</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.670" end="00:22:19.670" style="s2">Now one of the things you see in psycho therapy<br />very very commonly is that the person who’s</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.670" end="00:22:26.740" style="s2">coming for help does the same damn thing over<br />and over and over and every time they do it,</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.740" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">it has the same consequence.</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:29.950" style="s2">Bad.</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.950" end="00:22:34.730" style="s2">So they end up with the same kind of they<br />end up in the same kind of relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.730" end="00:22:39.179" style="s2">Right starts out well then the person turns<br />against them and starts to abuse them they</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.179" end="00:22:43.090" style="s2">get abused repeatedly then it ends then they<br />meet someone else and the cycle continues</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.090" end="00:22:46.429" style="s2">doesn’t seem to matter who they&#39;re out with<br />either they pick a person like this or they</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.429" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">turn the person into someone like that they<br />lose jobs the same way or their educational</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:57.900" style="s2">hopes fail the same way, why, well the person<br />thinks man… the structure of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.900" end="00:23:02.590" style="s2">so unfair everyone else seems to be getting<br />along just fine but me I get hit in the head</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.590" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">over and over.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">Exactly the same way and then you think well…<br />what is the structure of the world, exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:15.730" style="s2">and then you remember well you know there&#39;s<br />the things you don’t understand and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.730" end="00:23:21.309" style="s2">things you do understand and the things you<br />do understand structure you and protect you</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.309" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">but you know sometimes the things you do understand<br />aren&#39;t the right things, you&#39;re valuing something</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:32.340" style="s2">you&#39;re carrying something that’s an impediment<br />to your further progress and it’s frequently</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.340" end="00:23:37.080" style="s2">the case that it’s the kind of impediment<br />that under no conditions do you wanna give</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.080" end="00:23:41.950" style="s2">up because there&#39;s something about you that<br />says like John says about the ruby, look,</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.950" end="00:23:47.159" style="s2">it’s a ruby, who the hell cares if it weighs<br />100 pounds and I have to stand by the road</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.159" end="00:23:51.800" style="s2">I still got the ruby, and all you&#39;d ever have<br />to do is put the damn thing down and wander</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.800" end="00:23:53.809" style="s2">off and everything would be just fine</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.809" end="00:23:56.500" style="s2">but you won’t do it, why.</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.500" end="00:23:58.309" style="s2">Because you don’t wanna give up what you<br />know.</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.309" end="00:24:01.000" style="s2">Because you don’t wanna sacrifice anything.</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.000" end="00:24:06.460" style="s2">Well, long before people had any psychological<br />acumen or any psychological knowledge they</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.460" end="00:24:12.909" style="s2">all ready figured out that if you were gonna<br />take on a figure like this and expect to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.909" end="00:24:18.820" style="s2">absolutely anywhere with her right the horrors<br />of the world, you bloody well better be willing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.820" end="00:24:23.630" style="s2">to sacrifice whatever’s necessary to keep<br />you going along your path right unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.630" end="00:24:28.909" style="s2">the things that you have to sacrifice are<br />often those things that you&#39;re most particularly</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.909" end="00:24:33.820" style="s2">compelled by or gripped by or value the things<br />that you wanna give up least.</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.820" end="00:24:42.940" style="s2">Which is why in archaic societies where all<br />this is dramatized people sacrifice an animal</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.940" end="00:24:46.549" style="s2">that they value particularly.</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.549" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">Or eerier than that even a child that they<br />value particularly right dramatically portraying</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:59.310" style="s2">the idea of sacrifice you have to give something<br />up if you wanna make an inroad on what she</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.310" end="00:25:01.230" style="s2">represents.</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.230" end="00:25:07.260" style="s2">And so then you say the purpose of sacrifice<br />is to turn the terrible aspect of the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.260" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">into the benevolent aspect of the world and<br />this is Diana not a Hindu goddess but a Greek</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:24.029" style="s2">a Roman goddess same idea applies in the Hindu<br />case if you make the appropriate sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.029" end="00:25:29.929" style="s2">then the terrible aspect of the world turns<br />into the benevolent aspect of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.929" end="00:25:34.520" style="s2">And it is the case that even empirical studies<br />of success indicate that intelligence is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.520" end="00:25:39.070" style="s2">handy thing to have, but hard work and dedication<br />is a handy thing to have too and what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.070" end="00:25:44.649" style="s2">means is that you&#39;re constantly willing to<br />sacrifice the impulsive pleasure of the present</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.649" end="00:25:47.330" style="s2">for the hopes of payback in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.330" end="00:25:52.490" style="s2">For example the sacrifice immediate gratification<br />to obtain an appropriate social role take</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.490" end="00:25:53.690" style="s2">your place in society.</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.690" end="00:25:59.639" style="s2">It’s definitely a sacrifice right because<br />you put off pleasures in the moment to obtain</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.639" end="00:26:03.100" style="s2">long term stability and productivity.</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.100" end="00:26:10.399" style="s2">To turn the world into this.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.399" end="00:26:17.620" style="s2">And so then you can say, this is how the world<br />falls apart as it’s explored right so first</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.620" end="00:26:22.010" style="s2">of all there&#39;s the thing that you can’t<br />even name that only fills you with dread and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.010" end="00:26:27.730" style="s2">but also with the sense of possibility and<br />that manifests itself in your life as something</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.730" end="00:26:28.730" style="s2">concrete.</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.730" end="00:26:33.429" style="s2">That you don’t know promising and threatening<br />and that divides itself up into those aspects</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.429" end="00:26:38.890" style="s2">of the world that you value and admire and<br />that hold promise for you, and those aspects</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.890" end="00:26:44.940" style="s2">of the world that don’t and that’s a differentiation<br />as a consequence of exploration.</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.940" end="00:26:49.929" style="s2">It’s not a differentiation of the world<br />into objects though it’s a differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.929" end="00:26:55.460" style="s2">of the world into categories of emotion, those<br />things that are good for you those things</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.460" end="00:26:59.020" style="s2">that are bad for you and the source that they&#39;re<br />derived from.</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.020" end="00:27:01.289" style="s2">That’s the background of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.289" end="00:27:02.529" style="s2">We&#39;ll stop!</p>
