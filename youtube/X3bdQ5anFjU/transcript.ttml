<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">think first reading you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">kind of hear that as</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">i probably had a less fitted</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">hearing would it be to hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">that the logos is simply</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">hearing the one as if the logos is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:50.159" style="s2">in the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">and to listen to the logos is to listen</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.159" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">that all things are one</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">however if you think about it if that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">were the case</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">there would be there&#39;d be uh the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">part of the fragment wouldn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">exist right</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s like provide provided you listen</p>

<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">have a psyche in a gathering an</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">there&#39;s something at stake</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.199" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">in our listening to the logos</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">which affords something like the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">atoning all so</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">what i when i when i take this to me is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">really interesting when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">this because</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">it shows that</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">is heard through our participation with</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">right and our participation with the</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">you could say the little uh little l</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">right relates to the big l logos</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">that that in first of all it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">it it presupposes that it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">to be this way so in other words i could</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">end up just hearing you right the</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">if i just hear the speaker i&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">to hear the logos he&#39;s making a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">distinction there so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">i think the distinction is is the one</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">hearing and listening right what is it</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">what is to listen i think hearing</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.599" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">connotates</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">more of a surface sense like i can hear</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">the background music or i can hear the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">ambient noise</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">right there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:15.919" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t have to look into or listen into</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.919" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">what i&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">right i can just hear it and it be given</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s satisfactory enough right but</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">to listen</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">right it&#39;s something else listening</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">seems to</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">right or kind of a radical listening</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">a radical openness to what is not</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.839" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">of the logos itself becomes a fitted</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">knowledge such that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">i can hear the music of the world i can</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">the the wholeness which</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">of the whole right so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have to happen it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">like the one is just</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just is one and that&#39;s just waiting</p>

<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">you know pay attention to it no it&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">think it speaks to a participant as john</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">would say a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">knowing a authentic way of</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">as a being in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">but what what&#39;s interesting about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">if you really think about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">i think what heidegger is getting at</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">what all of the philosophers who talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">about nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">are getting at a lot of the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">or the meaning crisis and all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">different ways that um</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">you know you can you can kind of say</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">that we don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">we and we don&#39;t we don&#39;t hear that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">and the denialism today i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">i believe this is what heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">getting at is uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">is is the nihilism is a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:07.920" style="s2">consequence of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">of the lack of listening to the logos</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">and because we hear heroclitus instead</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">the logos right we don&#39;t notice</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">a few generations of this and people</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">kind of grow up not even noticing</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:42.639" style="s2">in the thatness</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">right in the that there is god the sense</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">right in such a deep way i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">what i think is what they&#39;re getting at</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">with nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">right the notion of nihilism so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">taking that into mind being mindful of</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">right well i think the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">that we probably need to start</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">hearing that we&#39;re not listening which</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">is not easy</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">listening is really interesting because</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in which the the</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:13.600" style="s2">right it&#39;s very much the case with</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.600" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">so you can&#39;t really teach somebody to</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.199" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">i think what what ends up actually</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">is that is that is that people make</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">listening explicit and then they go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">listen and then they start to hear that</p>

<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">and the moment that one hears that</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">is the moment the listening has begun</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">perhaps for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">it&#39;s so near and in</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.679" style="s2">that&#39;s where nihilism is right i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">is in that structure of nearness and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.679" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">structure of thinking and how we think</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:02.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">how we listen and therefore the risk is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.720" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">the very act of trying to</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">right is often with the very</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">the very consciousness that causes it if</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">you will</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s very tricky in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">so logos right i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.320" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">i think the very the very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">of philosophy really was with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:41.039" style="s2">pre-socratics and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">logo seems to be i would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.039" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">heraclitus&#39;s thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">logos is the inception</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">of the thinking of being right and it</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">and and because of you know thousands of</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">of you could say the separation</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">of thought and being becomes more and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">more separate</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.039" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">we have it&#39;s analogous to saying that</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">right is mirrored by</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">repetitive thoughts in your head i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">mean that kind of thing i mean more like</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">has become more and more separate we no</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.840" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">longer very rare like i just don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">that people walk around with a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:45.960" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">um i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">right there&#39;s a part it&#39;s a deep unified</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a deep separation there</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">to even notice anymore i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the crisis right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">in addressing that right one of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:29.679" style="s2">and that it&#39;s truthness</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">belongs to concealment so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.679" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">now though we when we think about truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">we only really kind of see truth in</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">terms of correctness</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">or you know this kind of separation</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">right um where</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">the model of the world when it matches</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">the events in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">that sense of correlation we call that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">truth and that if it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.640" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and it doesn&#39;t correlate then</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">true whereas whereas in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">original notion of in early early greek</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">ancient greek something once</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">when something was less true right they</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">saw it as pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">right its appearance displayed less</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">of concealment right</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">in other words they still saw nothing</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">nothing still had being</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">in fact all the good stuff was in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">nothing it was not nothing it was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">it was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">the potential the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">out of which the world poured</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">and that truth was a way of comporting</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">oneself into</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">in some sense um</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">dancing with it out into more</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">truthness and conceal unconcealing</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">its concealedness so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">like poets really do understand and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">poetry</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">good poetry can reveal the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:23.120" style="s2">without making it known they can reveal</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">the unknown as such</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">but reveal it and preserve it</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">in its unknownness that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">presence right or it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not forced into appearance</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">which is really like optimization this</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">is the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">the sense of utility right</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">seeing everything as a means to an end</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">or optimizing it or</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">extracting the energy out of it right</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">seeing everything as a resource</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">in order to do that you have to like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">have to really just relate to things in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">a very shallow way</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">you can&#39;t really tend you can&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">the sense in which the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">truth of being is in its</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">is in its inability to reveal itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">in just its objective appearance</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">that the listening is the thing that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">listen to what&#39;s most silent</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s that&#39;s that hum</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">of silence</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">thanks for listening</p>
