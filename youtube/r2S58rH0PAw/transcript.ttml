<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">get to the heart of it and discover some</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.989" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">some people think there&#39;s an exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:01.609" style="s2">of warmth I think sometimes when talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:04.790" style="s2">about Peterson&#39;s ideas and he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.890" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">I presume that&#39;s why you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">yes and doing a public couple of public</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">lectures how do you find that now how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">you finding what in a way I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">comparing you to the British opposition</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">leader Jeremy Corbyn in that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:11.450" style="s2">doing this for ages and now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">experiencing a almost perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.450" end="00:02:16.350" style="s2">unprecedented level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">attention but I&#39;m assuming that your</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.350" end="00:02:23.310" style="s2">skillset is applicable you&#39;re a lecturer</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">you&#39;re a clinical cyclist so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">like oh my god there&#39;s cameras right</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:29.460" style="s2">right well and I mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:31.710" style="s2">large-scale lectures I&#39;m doing aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.460" end="00:02:33.450" style="s2">that much different in kind from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.710" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2">lectures I was doing at the University I</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.450" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">mean the venues are larger and yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:40.770" style="s2">the Hammersmith Apollo 3,000 seats I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:41.340" style="s2">think maybe yeah there were 5000 at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.770" end="00:02:45.210" style="s2">Apollo</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">well that&#39;s we don&#39;t nervous I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.210" end="00:02:49.080" style="s2">nervous doing that as I am often going</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:51.210" style="s2">to talk to journalists individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.080" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">journalists yeah because like the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.210" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">about those venues there&#39;s a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">things about them that work in my favor</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.420" end="00:02:59.450" style="s2">I mean I like talking to crowds you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve always enjoyed lecturing and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.450" end="00:03:04.020" style="s2">lecturing to several thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t much different than lecturing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.020" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">several hundred people but I also know</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:11.340" style="s2">that the people who&#39;ve come are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">happy to be there like I&#39;m speaking to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:16.290" style="s2">welcoming crowd and so and it&#39;s all all</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">of the details are essentially under my</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.290" end="00:03:22.860" style="s2">control so so it&#39;s not it&#39;s I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:24.330" style="s2">enjoying it quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.860" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m apprehensive beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.330" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">because well because you should be you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">know I want to do a good job and I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">to make sure things go well and I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.430" style="s2">to get through the material properly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:37.740" style="s2">and and get a little farther in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.430" end="00:03:38.910" style="s2">thinking than I have been and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.740" end="00:03:40.380" style="s2">trying to make each time I lecture</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.910" end="00:03:43.590" style="s2">better than the last time and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">obviously I&#39;d always don&#39;t succeed at</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.590" end="00:03:47.910" style="s2">that but but it&#39;s good I&#39;m enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:49.710" style="s2">and my wife is a very good travel</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">companion she&#39;s very stable and she</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.710" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">helps me plan my days and so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:57.570" style="s2">it down to a bit of a routine I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:03:59.400" style="s2">say Tammy is in the room with us we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.570" end="00:04:01.260" style="s2">already met previously in Los Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.400" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">you won&#39;t be on mic there isn&#39;t my book</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.260" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">it&#39;s just in case listeners are</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:07.050" style="s2">wondering why perhaps they might be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:09.750" style="s2">to detect in my voice I&#39;m occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.050" end="00:04:15.420" style="s2">glancing towards a spouse the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.750" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">because I am I&#39;m good when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.420" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">these lectures you know is there not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">performance component do you not feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">like f initely</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:25.320" style="s2">yeah well sure I mean a lecture theatre</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.380" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">is a theatre you know and lecture is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.320" end="00:04:29.910" style="s2">form of theatre now it&#39;s a series</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:32.940" style="s2">form of theater but theater can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.910" end="00:04:35.010" style="s2">serious you know and and there&#39;s a see</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.940" end="00:04:38.010" style="s2">because partly what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.010" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">presenting ideas to an audience but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.010" end="00:04:43.950" style="s2">also modeling the act of engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:45.990" style="s2">ideas and that&#39;s the theatrical end of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.950" end="00:04:47.790" style="s2">it and I don&#39;t give the same talk twice</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.990" end="00:04:49.740" style="s2">like I have my stories and I have my</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.790" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">collection of things I know and I talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.740" end="00:04:56.640" style="s2">about but I try to I try to do two</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:04:58.830" style="s2">things I try to in I&#39;m always talking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.640" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">specific individuals in the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">so I&#39;m having a conversation with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">audience and so that&#39;s that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:06.390" style="s2">the dynamic element of the performance</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">and the other thing I&#39;m trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.390" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">to further my thinking on the topics</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:11.730" style="s2">that I&#39;m addressing and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:14.070" style="s2">theatrical element to that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.730" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like I think this the closest thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.070" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">really that it compares to is probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.990" end="00:05:20.640" style="s2">stand-up comedy although I think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:23.100" style="s2">routines that comedians have are</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.640" end="00:05:25.170" style="s2">probably more well and formally</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.100" end="00:05:27.090" style="s2">practiced than the ones that that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.170" end="00:05:29.820" style="s2">know then then the then that talks that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.090" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">I that I engage in I don&#39;t really think</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.820" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">of it as delivering a lecture to an</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:37.380" style="s2">audience I&#39;m trying to think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:39.540" style="s2">complicated things in real time with an</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.380" end="00:05:42.450" style="s2">audience there to participate and and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.540" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">use the audience as an indicator of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.450" end="00:05:48.020" style="s2">whether what I&#39;m saying is gripping and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:50.340" style="s2">comprehensible your apprehension and</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.680" end="00:06:09.410" style="s2">so yeah but for us I would argue there</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.650" end="00:06:12.900" style="s2">is a there is a distinction between</p>

<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:50.190" style="s2">interesting is that there&#39;s a clear</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.590" end="00:09:06.090" style="s2">correct I think that know that the New</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.290" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">York Times has recently written about</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.090" end="00:09:10.200" style="s2">the rise of the so-called intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:12.450" style="s2">dark web which is a term that Eric</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.200" end="00:09:16.020" style="s2">Weinstein so brilliantly coined I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.450" end="00:09:18.750" style="s2">say and and very thoughtfully I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.020" end="00:09:21.060" style="s2">the the thing that unites the people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.750" end="00:09:23.310" style="s2">are loosely grouped into that collection</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.060" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">is that they are having serious</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.310" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">conversations with an audience that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.030" style="s2">respect and they&#39;re very diverse range</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:31.950" style="s2">of people they don&#39;t certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.030" end="00:09:35.700" style="s2">like salmon sam harris and i disagree</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.950" end="00:09:38.580" style="s2">about many things for example and but</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.700" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">sam respects his audiences and he&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.580" end="00:09:44.100" style="s2">he&#39;s engaging them in extremely serious</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">discourse about very deep topics and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.100" end="00:09:47.640" style="s2">about the structure of reality actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:51.840" style="s2">and and the relationship between science</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.640" end="00:09:53.670" style="s2">and religion and and and the and i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.840" end="00:09:55.860" style="s2">it is a consequence of the fact that not</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.670" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">only has our public discourse let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.860" end="00:09:59.580" style="s2">in the media and in politics become</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">shallow i think it&#39;s become unbearably</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.580" end="00:10:05.820" style="s2">shallow in the universities so yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:08.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s become so ideological you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.820" end="00:10:09.630" style="s2">know and it&#39;s just not helpful look I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.040" end="00:10:12.030" style="s2">was interviewed by a New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.630" end="00:10:14.040" style="s2">journalist last week Nellie was her name</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.030" end="00:10:16.380" style="s2">and she&#39;s going to publish this on</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.040" end="00:10:20.070" style="s2">Sunday and she did a literature degree</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.380" end="00:10:21.950" style="s2">at Columbia and she told me that she was</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.070" end="00:10:25.410" style="s2">quite appalled actually by her degree</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.950" end="00:10:27.750" style="s2">especially in in hindsight she told me</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.410" end="00:10:30.150" style="s2">that she didn&#39;t know until she graduated</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.750" end="00:10:31.530" style="s2">that there was any other way of reading</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.150" end="00:10:33.870" style="s2">great literature than through a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.530" end="00:10:36.690" style="s2">postmodern lens and the postmodern lens</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.870" end="00:10:38.990" style="s2">takes a book and basically you take a</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.690" end="00:10:42.150" style="s2">book whatever it happens to be and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.990" end="00:10:44.460" style="s2">decide which power hierarchy the author</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.150" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">was serving and who&#39;s he who he&#39;s excel</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.460" end="00:10:48.690" style="s2">sheet has excluded from consideration so</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:50.550" style="s2">it&#39;s completely read through a political</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.690" end="00:10:52.670" style="s2">lens as if the book is nothing but a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.550" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">tool of political and economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.670" end="00:10:57.470" style="s2">domination essentially and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">assumption and like look everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.470" end="00:11:02.760" style="s2">contaminated by politics and power to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:04.020" style="s2">some degree right but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.760" end="00:11:07.620" style="s2">that there&#39;s nothing to art and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.020" end="00:11:09.000" style="s2">literature except in service of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.620" end="00:11:10.620" style="s2">group domination</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.000" end="00:11:12.420" style="s2">it&#39;s an appalling way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.620" end="00:11:15.540" style="s2">world it would be an extraordinary bias</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.420" end="00:11:17.220" style="s2">to bring to Jane Eyre it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.540" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">difficult to sort of make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.220" end="00:11:21.149" style="s2">through that lens of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:23.100" style="s2">economics and politics yeah of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.149" end="00:11:26.129" style="s2">important themes are going to be present</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.100" end="00:11:27.689" style="s2">in great works of art but I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.129" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">interested there&#39;s still great works of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.689" end="00:11:31.589" style="s2">art yeah it&#39;s the thing and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">well even even with something as</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.589" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">transient as comedy let&#39;s say I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:39.930" style="s2">can&#39;t reduce comedy to the political or</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:42.660" style="s2">the economic and comics who become too</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.930" end="00:11:44.610" style="s2">ideological let&#39;s say like musicians who</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.660" end="00:11:47.189" style="s2">become a dealer to ideological they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.610" end="00:11:49.139" style="s2">just not funny anymore yeah you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.189" end="00:11:51.269" style="s2">be I mean you can have your viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.139" end="00:11:53.399" style="s2">left or right that&#39;s fine and people do</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.269" end="00:11:55.050" style="s2">but you have to be able to transcend</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.399" end="00:11:56.610" style="s2">that viewpoint continually and you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.050" end="00:11:58.350" style="s2">to be able to criticize it right because</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.610" end="00:12:00.600" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re not a music you just</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.350" end="00:12:03.540" style="s2">become a demagogue of sorts yes I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.600" end="00:12:06.600" style="s2">agree that once there&#39;s a rubric to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.540" end="00:12:09.089" style="s2">which you become enslaved that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.600" end="00:12:11.269" style="s2">dogmatic then then there&#39;s no room for</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.089" end="00:12:15.329" style="s2">nuance there&#39;s no room for hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.269" end="00:12:18.029" style="s2">humor but transcendent mirth chaos these</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.329" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">forces need to be unleashed there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.029" end="00:12:21.509" style="s2">things you can no longer laugh about</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:24.209" style="s2">because you&#39;re you know you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.509" end="00:12:26.430" style="s2">committed to your axioms you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.209" end="00:12:27.959" style="s2">you dare not transgress against them and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.430" end="00:12:30.300" style="s2">if that&#39;s deadly if you&#39;re a comedian</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.959" end="00:12:31.889" style="s2">because the rule for comedy would be and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.300" end="00:12:34.319" style="s2">this is something I like about about</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.889" end="00:12:36.420" style="s2">Sarah Silverman for example is she will</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.319" end="00:12:38.670" style="s2">say anything if she thinks it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.420" end="00:12:40.470" style="s2">she&#39;s very daring in that manner and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.670" end="00:12:43.379" style="s2">like I&#39;ve heard her tell jokes that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.470" end="00:12:45.000" style="s2">really would curl your hair you know but</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.379" end="00:12:46.379" style="s2">you can tell by watching or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.000" end="00:12:47.730" style="s2">will pop into her head in part of her</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.379" end="00:12:49.800" style="s2">ghost case I don&#39;t know if I should say</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.730" end="00:12:52.829" style="s2">this and then she&#39;ll say it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.800" end="00:12:54.600" style="s2">often like horribly funny and horribly</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.829" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">funny is a good kind of funny I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.600" end="00:12:58.949" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s daring and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:00.990" style="s2">something I really admire about</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.949" end="00:13:04.529" style="s2">comedians too is that they&#39;ll they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.990" end="00:13:09.410" style="s2">take that risk and and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.529" end="00:13:11.699" style="s2">also that I&#39;ve found disturbing about</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.410" end="00:13:13.589" style="s2">with regards to the many things I find</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.699" end="00:13:16.319" style="s2">disturbing about university campuses is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.589" end="00:13:18.630" style="s2">that so many comedians won&#39;t go perform</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.319" end="00:13:21.750" style="s2">on university campuses anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.630" end="00:13:22.470" style="s2">they can&#39;t be funny people get offended</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.750" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.470" end="00:13:26.430" style="s2">it&#39;s so false offend offended I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:30.420" style="s2">you&#39;re right I mean I think it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.430" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">kind of Simon Says type of like do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.420" end="00:13:32.760" style="s2">know that games you have that game in</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:34.500" style="s2">your language just like are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.760" end="00:13:36.060" style="s2">certain things that we know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.500" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">allowed to say there&#39;s certain things</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.060" end="00:13:41.160" style="s2">that we know is supposed to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:43.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a a kind of formulaic</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.160" end="00:13:47.480" style="s2">dance a courtly behavior I&#39;ve heard it</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.800" end="00:13:50.040" style="s2">referred to as that we are meant to pay</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.040" end="00:13:55.080" style="s2">protocols and manners and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.740" end="00:13:57.480" style="s2">necessarily anchored to a real morality</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.080" end="00:14:00.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not anchored to a sort of a sense</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.270" end="00:14:04.530" style="s2">is about like these are the rules that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.130" end="00:14:07.950" style="s2">we abide by I want to talk to you a bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.530" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">about the 12 steps and the model for</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.950" end="00:14:11.490" style="s2">handling addiction that I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:13.890" style="s2">about myself in my book recovery because</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.490" end="00:14:17.580" style="s2">I want to see what you think of it like</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.890" end="00:14:19.860" style="s2">so like the 12 steps have anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.580" end="00:14:20.940" style="s2">fellowships which I if I were to belong</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.860" end="00:14:22.620" style="s2">to them I wouldn&#39;t be able to say I</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.940" end="00:14:25.740" style="s2">belong to them without breaching their</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.620" end="00:14:28.110" style="s2">code of anonymity but that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.740" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">positive about this approach to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.110" end="00:14:33.030" style="s2">addiction is as we have discussed</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:34.200" style="s2">off-mic that it creates community like</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.030" end="00:14:35.310" style="s2">that other people that have got a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.200" end="00:14:39.000" style="s2">similar endeavor and in fact it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.310" end="00:14:41.340" style="s2">young that identified this this solution</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:43.500" style="s2">here and he said that like people that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.340" end="00:14:44.940" style="s2">have got chronic addiction issues will</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:47.580" style="s2">struggle to change and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.940" end="00:14:49.140" style="s2">spiritual realization of some kind and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.580" end="00:14:50.940" style="s2">the support for community one the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.140" end="00:14:52.440" style="s2">spiritual realization component that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.940" end="00:14:55.200" style="s2">actually supported by the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.440" end="00:14:56.820" style="s2">addiction literature one of the classic</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.200" end="00:14:58.530" style="s2">cures for addiction is spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.820" end="00:15:00.960" style="s2">transformation and the hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.530" end="00:15:02.700" style="s2">scientists have have laid that out as as</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.960" end="00:15:04.380" style="s2">a reality in the addiction literature I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.700" end="00:15:05.970" style="s2">agree because they use more secular</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.380" end="00:15:08.100" style="s2">language around that a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.970" end="00:15:11.400" style="s2">transformation could just be a change of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.100" end="00:15:13.800" style="s2">perspective a renewal radical change of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.400" end="00:15:15.210" style="s2">perspective yeah and typically in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.800" end="00:15:17.730" style="s2">experience that&#39;s from a self-centered</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.210" end="00:15:20.870" style="s2">view a self obsessive view about getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.730" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">your own needs met a solipsistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.870" end="00:15:25.590" style="s2">narcissistic perspective of low life is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:28.020" style="s2">this is just an adventure where I go</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.590" end="00:15:30.390" style="s2">around trying to accumulate and accrue -</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.020" end="00:15:33.540" style="s2">oh wow I&#39;m here to be of service that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.390" end="00:15:36.210" style="s2">of the transition brain microscopically</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.540" end="00:15:38.790" style="s2">but in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.210" end="00:15:40.140" style="s2">community like having connections</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.790" end="00:15:43.230" style="s2">between one another</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.140" end="00:15:45.930" style="s2">the 12 steps themselves I think are an</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.230" end="00:15:48.149" style="s2">interesting model for transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.930" end="00:15:50.250" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be overlooked and in fact what</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.149" end="00:15:52.050" style="s2">my book was about Canton could that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.250" end="00:15:53.580" style="s2">method be transposed to anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.050" end="00:15:54.870" style="s2">interested in change so I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.580" end="00:15:56.700" style="s2">to you about that to get your</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.870" end="00:15:58.260" style="s2">perspective on room the first step is</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.700" end="00:15:59.550" style="s2">acknowledging that you are powerless</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.260" end="00:16:02.310" style="s2">over your addiction and your life has</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.550" end="00:16:04.380" style="s2">become unmanageable just that mean this</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.310" end="00:16:06.990" style="s2">is I don&#39;t obey in this way so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.380" end="00:16:10.440" style="s2">there&#39;s two parts to that admission a1</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.990" end="00:16:12.060" style="s2">is that you&#39;re in trouble yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.440" end="00:16:15.149" style="s2">guess there&#39;s three you&#39;re in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.060" end="00:16:17.850" style="s2">and it&#39;s serious things could be better</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.149" end="00:16:19.800" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have the wherewithal at</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.850" end="00:16:21.270" style="s2">the moment to make them better so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:23.310" style="s2">thing that&#39;s interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.270" end="00:16:24.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of radical humiliation</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.310" end="00:16:26.610" style="s2">and humility that goes along with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.779" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">so you say I have a problem yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.610" end="00:16:30.990" style="s2">what I know at the moment isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.430" style="s2">sufficient to solve it great because now</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.990" end="00:16:34.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve opened yourself up to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.430" end="00:16:35.580" style="s2">possibility of learning something yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.200" end="00:16:37.560" style="s2">you say well I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.580" end="00:16:39.930" style="s2">enough to fix this it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.560" end="00:16:41.459" style="s2">you could learn and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.930" end="00:16:43.230" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting about people is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.459" end="00:16:45.420" style="s2">that if they decide they have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.230" end="00:16:47.339" style="s2">and they also noticed that they could</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.420" end="00:16:49.620" style="s2">learn the probability that they will</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.339" end="00:16:51.390" style="s2">learn goes way up that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.620" end="00:16:53.510" style="s2">interesting you&#39;ve actually conflated</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.390" end="00:16:56.250" style="s2">the first three steps there in your</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.510" end="00:16:57.930" style="s2">analysis of the first one because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.250" end="00:16:59.880" style="s2">first one is admission that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.930" end="00:17:01.500" style="s2">problem the second one is recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.880" end="00:17:02.670" style="s2">that things could improve accounts</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.500" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">believe that power great in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.670" end="00:17:06.390" style="s2">could restore us to sanity and the third</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:08.189" style="s2">one is made a decision to turn our life</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.390" end="00:17:10.829" style="s2">and our will over to the care of God as</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.189" end="00:17:12.929" style="s2">we understood God so like yeah we could</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.829" end="00:17:14.370" style="s2">talk about that from a secular cool well</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.929" end="00:17:16.170" style="s2">we could talk about that from a secular</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.370" end="00:17:17.910" style="s2">perspective and say well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.170" end="00:17:19.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a higher-order moral principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.910" end="00:17:21.150" style="s2">that needs to be brought into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.050" end="00:17:22.500" style="s2">situation and you sort of describe that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.150" end="00:17:24.990" style="s2">right at the beginning of the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.500" end="00:17:26.910" style="s2">because you said well what partly what</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.990" end="00:17:28.830" style="s2">you do when you move from an addicted</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.910" end="00:17:31.380" style="s2">state from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.830" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">is move from a viewpoint of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.380" end="00:17:35.490" style="s2">gratification of immediate desire and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.890" style="s2">and maybe the accumulation of things as</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.490" end="00:17:39.540" style="s2">a marker of success to the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.890" end="00:17:41.730" style="s2">no you actually have a higher purpose</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.540" end="00:17:43.650" style="s2">and that higher purpose might involve</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.730" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">being of service that could be of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.650" end="00:17:46.470" style="s2">service to yourself which means you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:47.669" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be addicted any more because</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.470" end="00:17:49.559" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good way of being of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.669" end="00:17:50.150" style="s2">service to yourself but of service to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.559" end="00:17:52.220" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.150" end="00:17:53.870" style="s2">the broader community however you might</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.460" end="00:20:03.980" style="s2">actually quite a lot like fixing</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.840" end="00:20:06.169" style="s2">yourself up which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.980" end="00:20:07.910" style="s2">very common dream metaphor yeah well the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.169" end="00:20:09.320" style="s2">first thing you want to do is go look</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.910" end="00:20:11.900" style="s2">around and see what needs to be fixed</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.320" end="00:20:14.059" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.900" end="00:20:16.160" style="s2">about that and it&#39;s as akin to what</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.059" end="00:20:17.480" style="s2">comedians do is that as soon as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.160" end="00:20:19.160" style="s2">willing to admit</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.480" end="00:20:20.510" style="s2">comedians look at a problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.160" end="00:20:22.040" style="s2">rise above it right away and make a joke</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.510" end="00:20:25.130" style="s2">about it but as soon as you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.040" end="00:20:27.500" style="s2">to admit that you have a problem then</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.130" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">you&#39;re immediately contacted the part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.500" end="00:20:31.220" style="s2">yourself that&#39;s at least strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:33.410" style="s2">to admit that you have a problem and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.220" end="00:20:35.150" style="s2">soon the act of admitting the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.410" end="00:20:37.340" style="s2">actually the first step to solving it</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.150" end="00:20:39.470" style="s2">yes you might say well and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.340" end="00:20:41.450" style="s2">optimistic step because you might say oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.470" end="00:20:43.220" style="s2">my god I can&#39;t admit to I that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.450" end="00:20:45.559" style="s2">problem because what if I can&#39;t solve it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.220" end="00:20:47.809" style="s2">Oh exactly so then maybe you won&#39;t admit</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.559" end="00:20:49.700" style="s2">to it if you do admit to it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.809" end="00:20:51.380" style="s2">simultaneously admitting to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.700" end="00:20:52.610" style="s2">possibility that you could solve it yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.380" end="00:20:54.890" style="s2">and then it can actually become</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.610" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2">something that&#39;s optimistic you can say</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.890" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">well my life is horrible it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.900" end="00:21:01.640" style="s2">but I&#39;m doing 50 things wrong well great</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:03.350" style="s2">I could fix those things and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.640" end="00:21:04.700" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be so horrible demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.350" end="00:21:06.770" style="s2">the admission itself demonstrates</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.700" end="00:21:08.450" style="s2">progression and possibility for further</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.770" end="00:21:10.940" style="s2">progression I think it relates that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.450" end="00:21:13.040" style="s2">why humility is always stressed in great</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.940" end="00:21:15.290" style="s2">religious traditions humility is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.040" end="00:21:19.340" style="s2">precisely that it&#39;s like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.290" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">look at why you&#39;re not so good yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.340" end="00:21:23.270" style="s2">and you know that that has to break down</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:24.500" style="s2">your pride to some degree in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.270" end="00:21:26.030" style="s2">arrogance it&#39;s like well that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.500" end="00:21:27.260" style="s2">because if you break down your pride and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.030" end="00:21:29.540" style="s2">your arrogance then you&#39;re primed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.260" end="00:21:31.220" style="s2">learn and you can solve your problems so</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.540" end="00:21:32.900" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in that it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.220" end="00:21:34.730" style="s2">crushing to begin with because you might</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.900" end="00:21:36.200" style="s2">think oh my god there&#39;s really a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.730" end="00:21:38.660" style="s2">things wrong with me yeah but at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.200" end="00:21:40.340" style="s2">then you&#39;re on the on the road to fixing</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.660" end="00:21:42.890" style="s2">them my personal journey of recovery has</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.340" end="00:21:44.750" style="s2">been a good like a kind of death like</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.890" end="00:21:46.460" style="s2">you know look at when I was 27 it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.750" end="00:21:48.890" style="s2">like the death of the drug addict self</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.460" end="00:21:50.840" style="s2">that guy does funny because I told him</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.890" end="00:21:52.700" style="s2">you when we were coming here today that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.840" end="00:21:55.160" style="s2">when you were 27 you made the decision</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.700" end="00:21:57.799" style="s2">to live yeah I knew it was 27 because</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.160" end="00:21:59.929" style="s2">that&#39;s when people and I say like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.799" end="00:22:02.360" style="s2">but you know celebrities who who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.929" end="00:22:04.280" style="s2">sort of on fire they die all the time at</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.360" end="00:22:06.380" style="s2">27 because they don&#39;t make that decision</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.280" end="00:22:08.390" style="s2">they decide they don&#39;t decide that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.380" end="00:22:11.150" style="s2">they&#39;re going to take that final step</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.390" end="00:22:13.340" style="s2">into maturation they want to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.150" end="00:22:15.890" style="s2">that Peter Pan thing that that parler</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.340" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">return is you bet you exactly that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.890" end="00:22:19.150" style="s2">want to hold on to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:21.820" style="s2">and you you can&#39;t hold on to that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.150" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">live yes and then there&#39;s a further</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.820" end="00:22:27.850" style="s2">death I&#39;m noticing now in my early 40s</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:31.330" style="s2">like are now at the midway point yeah at</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.850" end="00:22:34.840" style="s2">the mid lane of Dante s Quay and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.330" end="00:22:36.340" style="s2">moving towards the grave and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.840" end="00:22:39.159" style="s2">like there&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.340" end="00:22:40.630" style="s2">alertness emerging and back to this step</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.159" end="00:22:42.520" style="s2">four and five moment this process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.630" end="00:22:45.010" style="s2">inventory after you&#39;ve made an inventory</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.520" end="00:22:46.840" style="s2">and you&#39;ve you&#39;ve correctly you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.010" end="00:22:49.240" style="s2">honestly and openly put down everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.840" end="00:22:50.590" style="s2">incidents of child abuse things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.240" end="00:22:53.110" style="s2">you&#39;ve said to other people things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.590" end="00:22:55.750" style="s2">your shame once you&#39;ve been willing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.110" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">inscribe your shame then you tell</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.750" end="00:23:00.039" style="s2">another person a person that you trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">in the original literature it says you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.039" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">know it could be a cleric or doctor or</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:05.559" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">typically in in 12-step structures it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.559" end="00:23:08.919" style="s2">like a mentor figure but that has that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the role of confession which</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.919" end="00:23:12.970" style="s2">offers a huge part of psychoanalysis the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:14.440" style="s2">point in your book I think this pertains</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.970" end="00:23:15.820" style="s2">to is when you talk about the Dragon and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.440" end="00:23:17.140" style="s2">the dragon gate but you said there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.820" end="00:23:18.220" style="s2">that kids book that you read where it</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.220" end="00:23:22.179" style="s2">and bigger if it&#39;s not identified I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.470" end="00:23:24.010" style="s2">think four and five are somewhat like</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.179" end="00:23:25.630" style="s2">that yeah well in part of the point of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.010" end="00:23:27.220" style="s2">that kid&#39;s book is that as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.630" end="00:23:29.500" style="s2">turn around and look at something it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.220" end="00:23:31.929" style="s2">tends to shrink and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.500" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">because imagine that you have a memory</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.929" end="00:23:35.350" style="s2">that you won&#39;t confront well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:36.070" style="s2">something in that memory that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.350" end="00:23:37.990" style="s2">terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.070" end="00:23:39.610" style="s2">but and that means it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.990" end="00:23:40.419" style="s2">associated with everything else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.610" end="00:23:42.340" style="s2">terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.419" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">and so it&#39;s hor it&#39;s horrible but then</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.340" end="00:23:46.030" style="s2">when you turn around and look at it you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:48.340" style="s2">think yeah it&#39;s horrible but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.030" end="00:23:50.530" style="s2">horrible in this precise and defined way</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.340" end="00:23:53.049" style="s2">and that takes it away from all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.530" end="00:23:54.850" style="s2">other potential horrors of it it starts</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.049" end="00:23:56.590" style="s2">to shrink it right away it also makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.850" end="00:23:58.419" style="s2">you into the thing that can turn around</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.590" end="00:24:00.850" style="s2">and look at the horror which is a real</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.419" end="00:24:03.549" style="s2">real positive transformation left on</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.850" end="00:24:06.250" style="s2">your part so it&#39;s true that somehow in</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.549" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">like being being prescriptive and being</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.250" end="00:24:09.190" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:12.220" style="s2">the problem becomes manageable because</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.190" end="00:24:14.860" style="s2">it&#39;s limitless it&#39;s not actual it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.220" end="00:24:16.390" style="s2">becomes apocalyptic in the end is what</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.860" end="00:24:18.039" style="s2">what&#39;s the worst thing this cavern is I</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.390" end="00:24:19.870" style="s2">could be destroyed and if I know love</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.039" end="00:24:21.820" style="s2">could be destroyed and earth itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.870" end="00:24:23.110" style="s2">could be destroyed and until you say</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.820" end="00:24:25.539" style="s2">well actually know what this is is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.110" end="00:24:27.700" style="s2">feel inadequate because you weren&#39;t role</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.539" end="00:24:29.110" style="s2">model to correct right all right well</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.700" end="00:24:30.130" style="s2">maybe take care of that right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.110" end="00:24:32.110" style="s2">still bad but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.130" end="00:24:33.700" style="s2">everything and then you you phrased that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.110" end="00:24:35.950" style="s2">exactly right is that without that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.700" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">attentive delimiting it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.950" end="00:24:40.330" style="s2">apocalyptic that and that&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:42.040" style="s2">old idea so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.330" end="00:24:44.620" style="s2">happens in the Mesopotamian creation</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.040" end="00:24:46.330" style="s2">myth the Anu male ish is that the gods</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.620" end="00:24:48.130" style="s2">are created there they&#39;re that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.330" end="00:24:49.720" style="s2">the offspring of chaos that&#39;s a good way</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.130" end="00:24:51.940" style="s2">of thinking about it and they become</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.720" end="00:24:53.560" style="s2">very careless and they destroy their</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.940" end="00:24:55.450" style="s2">category system they destroy their</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.560" end="00:24:57.640" style="s2">father essentially and chaos comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.450" end="00:25:00.130" style="s2">flooding back and that&#39;s what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.640" end="00:25:02.050" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t looking at things and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.130" end="00:25:05.110" style="s2">delimiting them properly they become up</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.050" end="00:25:07.810" style="s2">apocalyptic and do them in so but</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.110" end="00:25:11.830" style="s2">sometimes in mythology there is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.810" end="00:25:14.200" style="s2">positive confront confronting of the god</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.830" end="00:25:16.630" style="s2">AG prometheus so sometimes we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.200" end="00:25:18.520" style="s2">steal steal the fire sometimes we need</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.630" end="00:25:21.070" style="s2">to challenge these wolf the dachsies</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.520" end="00:25:23.470" style="s2">don&#39;t we yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.070" end="00:25:25.150" style="s2">I mean part part of the well part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.470" end="00:25:27.010" style="s2">death that you&#39;re describing is actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.150" end="00:25:30.820" style="s2">the confrontation with a form of tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.010" end="00:25:34.030" style="s2">like your previously addicted self was</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.820" end="00:25:36.160" style="s2">the tyrant over your emergent self yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.030" end="00:25:37.750" style="s2">and so it&#39;s an internal tyrant and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.160" end="00:25:39.430" style="s2">said it was predicated on a false value</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.750" end="00:25:41.080" style="s2">system that&#39;s a false set of God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.430" end="00:25:42.580" style="s2">essentially and so you had to confront</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.080" end="00:25:45.070" style="s2">that that is a kind of death I also</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.580" end="00:25:46.630" style="s2">think that some addiction or addictive</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.070" end="00:25:48.010" style="s2">tendencies and I don&#39;t mean as severe as</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.630" end="00:25:49.990" style="s2">chemical dependency or forms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.010" end="00:25:52.600" style="s2">addiction addiction are a kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.990" end="00:25:54.850" style="s2">constructed formaldehyde to preserve you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.600" end="00:25:57.610" style="s2">in the state of trauma but trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.850" end="00:26:00.310" style="s2">acknowledged no means to navigate trauma</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.610" end="00:26:02.260" style="s2">are present because of the isolation</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.310" end="00:26:04.540" style="s2">because you have no mentor you have no</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:07.450" style="s2">you have no doctrine you have no</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.540" end="00:26:09.190" style="s2">community so addiction steps in this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.450" end="00:26:12.220" style="s2">how I will preserve this is how I will</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.190" end="00:26:14.200" style="s2">not die I will find this rep notice that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.220" end="00:26:16.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a habit a repeated pattern to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.200" end="00:26:18.790" style="s2">sustain you a holding pattern so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.930" end="00:26:20.710" style="s2">you don&#39;t die because there is no way</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.790" end="00:26:22.840" style="s2">out there&#39;s no guide there&#39;s no path you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.710" end="00:26:24.910" style="s2">were just in the forest and there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.840" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">a way out so I feel that addiction for</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.910" end="00:26:29.920" style="s2">personal experience and that I hope and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:33.490" style="s2">suspect more broadly is a means for sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.920" end="00:26:36.160" style="s2">of stasis for preservation after trauma</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.490" end="00:26:38.740" style="s2">the rupture occurs is not addressed and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.160" end="00:26:39.820" style="s2">a means for survival emerges in the form</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.740" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">of addiction addiction is not your</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.820" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">nemesis it is your friend at least while</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:43.539" style="s2">you&#39;re you know in whilst you&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:45.190" style="s2">there sir</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.539" end="00:26:47.019" style="s2">the literature on addiction that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.190" end="00:26:48.460" style="s2">indicates that many people use addictive</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.019" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">substances as a form of self-medication</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.460" end="00:26:54.729" style="s2">and they tend to find the drug that best</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">best medicates them let&#39;s say and for</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.729" end="00:27:00.369" style="s2">different people that&#39;s different drugs</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:03.669" style="s2">yes I think and now see one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.369" end="00:27:06.249" style="s2">things I&#39;m proposing in my book is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.669" end="00:27:10.409" style="s2">use rather grandiose terminology is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.249" end="00:27:13.029" style="s2">the the the template for a recovery from</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.409" end="00:27:16.210" style="s2">obvious forms of addiction could be</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.029" end="00:27:18.279" style="s2">applicable to less evident forms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.210" end="00:27:21.369" style="s2">addiction ie just patterns and habits</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.279" end="00:27:22.779" style="s2">and become well so far the things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.369" end="00:27:24.700" style="s2">laid out would be would be in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.779" end="00:27:26.769" style="s2">with that I would I well you admit to</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.700" end="00:27:30.070" style="s2">the problem yeah I really also I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.769" end="00:27:31.809" style="s2">the idea of laying out your resentments</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.070" end="00:27:34.029" style="s2">is unbelievably useful because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.809" end="00:27:35.590" style="s2">also a way of dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.029" end="00:27:37.570" style="s2">malevolence within you that might</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.590" end="00:27:39.940" style="s2">interfere with your own recovery yes if</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.620" end="00:32:13.560" style="s2">it&#39;s where the the spirituality becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.860" end="00:32:17.820" style="s2">I find personally undeniable that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.560" end="00:32:20.910" style="s2">have to you have to call to something</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.910" end="00:32:27.630" style="s2">yourself open the idea of prayer becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.300" end="00:32:30.860" style="s2">quite important now so there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.630" end="00:32:33.510" style="s2">a union idea there so the Union self is</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.860" end="00:32:35.970" style="s2">the thing that guides the ego through</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.510" end="00:32:37.770" style="s2">transformations so imagine the ego which</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.970" end="00:32:39.570" style="s2">is what you think you are mm-hmm all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.770" end="00:32:42.330" style="s2">thing about the ego is the Theia can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.570" end="00:32:44.370" style="s2">wrong and the ego can die and be reborn</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.330" end="00:32:46.350" style="s2">so what that indicates is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.370" end="00:32:47.670" style="s2">something underneath the ego yes it can</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.350" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">be a guide that process of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.670" end="00:32:51.480" style="s2">transformation is hardly what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.480" end="00:32:56.430" style="s2">power is at least from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.850" end="00:32:57.630" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s a decision to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.430" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">that thing that can guide you through</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.630" end="00:33:02.070" style="s2">transformations yes because surely as we</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:04.500" style="s2">said in relation to another we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.070" end="00:33:06.570" style="s2">likely relay into a set of coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.500" end="00:33:09.000" style="s2">that we impose on invoke honors the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.570" end="00:33:10.860" style="s2">female the true same would be true of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.000" end="00:33:13.310" style="s2">the self that we have created an</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.860" end="00:33:15.660" style="s2">impression an egoic impression we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.310" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">constructed an artificial self but</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.660" end="00:33:20.250" style="s2">beneath it there is a higher self or</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:22.230" style="s2">another yourself that&#39;s often composed</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.250" end="00:33:24.060" style="s2">it&#39;s often composed of things that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.230" end="00:33:25.590" style="s2">refused to or would we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.060" end="00:33:26.940" style="s2">willing to develop and so when young</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.590" end="00:33:28.590" style="s2">talks about for example the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.940" end="00:33:30.420" style="s2">incorporation of the shadow is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.590" end="00:33:32.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve constructed an ego and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.420" end="00:33:34.110" style="s2">things it can do and can&#39;t do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.520" end="00:33:35.940" style="s2">allowed to do and it isn&#39;t allowed to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.110" end="00:33:37.320" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a shadow domain that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.940" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">would consist of those things that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.320" end="00:33:41.340" style="s2">could do but haven&#39;t and some of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:45.450" style="s2">terrible but some of its what you need</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.340" end="00:33:47.430" style="s2">to break free is an infinite variety in</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.450" end="00:33:48.660" style="s2">the shadow or are they sort of templates</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.430" end="00:33:51.900" style="s2">there would you say that you know a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.660" end="00:33:54.360" style="s2">common component of his last aggression</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.900" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">aggression too because they&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.360" end="00:33:57.690" style="s2">the two mobilized yeah they&#39;re the two</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:33:59.880" style="s2">that are most difficult to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.690" end="00:34:01.680" style="s2">into the ego because aggression destroys</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.880" end="00:34:04.710" style="s2">and of course lost subsumes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.680" end="00:34:07.770" style="s2">individual to to to well to sexual</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.710" end="00:34:09.450" style="s2">sexual desire is such a lusty identified</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.770" end="00:34:11.670" style="s2">is a very powerful self it can it can</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.450" end="00:34:14.670" style="s2">subsume so I suppose that&#39;s why a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.670" end="00:34:18.150" style="s2">theological doctrines focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.670" end="00:34:20.280" style="s2">control there is of course it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.150" end="00:34:22.020" style="s2">disruptive force you know because for</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.280" end="00:34:24.090" style="s2">example if you make a medium to long</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.020" end="00:34:26.130" style="s2">term relationship with someone and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.090" end="00:34:28.290" style="s2">negotiate that that provides you with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.130" end="00:34:30.060" style="s2">stable structure that can operate across</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.290" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">your entire life and just good for you</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.060" end="00:34:33.750" style="s2">it&#39;s good for them it&#39;s good for your</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:35.100" style="s2">kids it&#39;s good for society but then if</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.750" end="00:34:37.620" style="s2">you&#39;re really attracted to someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.100" end="00:34:39.450" style="s2">momentarily you can be driven to act on</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.620" end="00:34:41.880" style="s2">that and and and every all the rest of</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.140" end="00:43:20.250" style="s2">tradition is that a little bit of</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.200" end="00:44:13.259" style="s2">original sin like so a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">consciousness is a dangerous thing we</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.180" end="00:44:23.250" style="s2">the solution to this is to become more</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.250" end="00:44:30.569" style="s2">how was that the Bible yes and where</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.369" end="00:44:33.060" style="s2">does that get resolved yeah when they</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.569" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">get kicked out of the garden well well</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.060" end="00:44:38.130" style="s2">well part of part of what happens in in</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:39.570" style="s2">the in the redemptive story is if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.130" end="00:44:41.460" style="s2">think about Christ as a symbolic figure</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.570" end="00:44:43.110" style="s2">say a symbolic of the process of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.460" end="00:44:46.290" style="s2">transformation that we just described is</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.110" end="00:44:48.300" style="s2">one of the one of the morals of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.290" end="00:44:51.540" style="s2">Christian passion is that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.300" end="00:44:53.220" style="s2">radically accept your limitations and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.540" end="00:44:54.780" style="s2">part of this keeping your sins before</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.030" end="00:45:07.410" style="s2">consciousness and it&#39;s painful right</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.070" end="00:45:09.720" style="s2">because you think well you become more</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.410" end="00:45:11.970" style="s2">conscious it&#39;s this glorious process of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.720" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">enlightenment and overall it is but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.970" end="00:45:16.110" style="s2">details are exactly this the things you</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:17.700" style="s2">need to become consciousness conscious</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.110" end="00:45:19.890" style="s2">of are precisely those things that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.700" end="00:45:21.450" style="s2">least want to become conscious of and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.890" end="00:45:23.310" style="s2">that this is the motif that you</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.310" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">because the alchemical motile chemical</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.860" end="00:45:30.930" style="s2">motto so to speak was that which you</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:32.520" style="s2">most need to be found that which you</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.930" end="00:45:35.700" style="s2">most need to find will be found where</p>

<p begin="00:45:35.700" end="00:45:39.300" style="s2">everyone knows that&#39;s true like you tell</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.300" end="00:45:42.930" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah I know that&#39;s true so and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:44.970" style="s2">it&#39;s also the greatest barrier to</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.930" end="00:45:47.880" style="s2">enlightenment because if enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.970" end="00:45:49.440" style="s2">was all you know tulips and and sunshine</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.880" end="00:45:51.930" style="s2">then everyone would be enlightened but</p>

<p begin="00:48:12.840" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">so like anywhere but once I was in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.609" end="00:48:19.290" style="s2">environment and like you&#39;d have given</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:21.690" style="s2">drugs to help well I was addicted to</p>

<p begin="00:48:38.609" end="00:48:43.710" style="s2">but I do remember a kind of moment of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.950" end="00:48:46.590" style="s2">Epiphany if epiphany is revelation of</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.590" end="00:48:57.330" style="s2">like yeah never thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.600" end="00:48:59.940" style="s2">because that I&#39;d found a solution it</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.330" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">worked it worked as a way of managing</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.670" end="00:50:26.630" style="s2">and the final steps I&#39;ll stay connected</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.770" end="00:50:28.069" style="s2">once you wrote like your continual</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.630" end="00:50:30.589" style="s2">inventory and for the moment we think oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.069" end="00:50:33.950" style="s2">I felt something there you know that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.589" end="00:50:36.470" style="s2">want to be in the moment connected like</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.950" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">and what I have to note is if I come one</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.470" end="00:50:40.010" style="s2">makes me feel inferior or if someone if</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.710" end="00:50:54.440" style="s2">is made is help others right and remain</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.069" end="00:50:56.569" style="s2">awake well that&#39;s the end of the hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.440" end="00:50:58.130" style="s2">journey is once you go into the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.569" end="00:50:59.450" style="s2">and find something of value the next</p>

<p begin="00:52:37.700" end="00:52:41.720" style="s2">ago there were two things that I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.560" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">that I really didn&#39;t like the first is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.720" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">that because I&#39;m a personality</p>

<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:50.390" style="s2">clinician but as a researcher I I know</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.390" end="00:52:55.730" style="s2">personality because it&#39;s part of my</p>

<p begin="00:52:55.730" end="00:52:59.150" style="s2">starting to have some reluctance to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:02.060" style="s2">deliver the lecture on gender</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.150" end="00:53:05.630" style="s2">differences and now I didn&#39;t stop but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.060" end="00:53:08.120" style="s2">felt I felt that I was treading on thin</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.630" end="00:53:10.130" style="s2">ice by delivering those lectures and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.120" end="00:53:12.530" style="s2">thought oh that&#39;s not good because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.130" end="00:53:14.420" style="s2">like a comedian I&#39;m pretty much willing</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.530" end="00:53:16.190" style="s2">to say anything that I think is true and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.420" end="00:53:17.870" style="s2">and you know regardless of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.190" end="00:53:19.370" style="s2">consequences in some sense because I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.870" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">rather take the consequences of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.370" end="00:53:23.750" style="s2">true and I thought this isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:26.870" style="s2">because if someone like me who&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.750" end="00:53:27.430" style="s2">know rather uncontrollably mouthy let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.870" end="00:53:28.599" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.430" end="00:53:30.430" style="s2">is starting to have second thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.599" end="00:53:32.230" style="s2">about teaching what&#39;s a very serious</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.430" end="00:53:33.910" style="s2">topic and and and something about which</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.230" end="00:53:36.609" style="s2">there&#39;s a very well-developed science</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.910" end="00:53:38.650" style="s2">then how much are other people starting</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.609" end="00:53:40.900" style="s2">to censor and at the same time my</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.650" end="00:53:42.599" style="s2">students many of whom were female were</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.900" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">telling me that they were really</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.599" end="00:53:46.599" style="s2">hesitant to talk about gender</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:48.579" style="s2">differences in any of the courses they</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.599" end="00:53:50.589" style="s2">were running and I thought oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.579" end="00:53:53.890" style="s2">not good this is seriously not good and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.589" end="00:53:55.950" style="s2">so and it&#39;s certainly the case that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.890" end="00:53:58.839" style="s2">my colleagues censor themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.950" end="00:54:00.220" style="s2">increasingly on campus with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.839" end="00:54:01.240" style="s2">the topics they&#39;re willing to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.220" end="00:54:03.369" style="s2">and it&#39;s subtle</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.240" end="00:54:05.559" style="s2">you know because imagine in a given</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.369" end="00:54:09.609" style="s2">lecture I could discuss any of ten</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.559" end="00:54:12.819" style="s2">things and three of them are taboo well</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.609" end="00:54:14.380" style="s2">I just won&#39;t discuss those you know and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.819" end="00:54:15.970" style="s2">that&#39;s that that that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.380" end="00:54:17.500" style="s2">invisible censorship it&#39;s not like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.970" end="00:54:19.270" style="s2">get up and say look I could have talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.500" end="00:54:21.190" style="s2">to you about gender differences and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.270" end="00:54:23.170" style="s2">personality but I won&#39;t because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.190" end="00:54:24.640" style="s2">afraid I&#39;ll just pick another topic</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.170" end="00:54:27.010" style="s2">because there&#39;s lots of topics to choose</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.640" end="00:54:28.690" style="s2">from and that means there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.010" end="00:54:30.430" style="s2">a bunch of topics that are really</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.690" end="00:54:32.650" style="s2">important because actually the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.430" end="00:54:34.450" style="s2">sex differences in personality happens</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.650" end="00:54:36.760" style="s2">to be really important that people just</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.450" end="00:54:38.260" style="s2">won&#39;t talk about and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.760" end="00:54:40.180" style="s2">that&#39;s so annoying about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.260" end="00:54:42.099" style="s2">especially with regards to sex</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.180" end="00:54:44.890" style="s2">differences in personality it well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.099" end="00:54:46.750" style="s2">say let&#39;s say that you&#39;re firmly on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.890" end="00:54:50.380" style="s2">side of women just for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.750" end="00:54:52.299" style="s2">argument well do you admit to or deny</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.380" end="00:54:55.390" style="s2">the existence of sex differences in</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.299" end="00:54:56.859" style="s2">personality what&#39;s better for women well</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.390" end="00:54:59.049" style="s2">you know the radical left is basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.859" end="00:55:00.849" style="s2">say oh well those if you talk about sex</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.049" end="00:55:02.380" style="s2">differences then you&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.849" end="00:55:04.690" style="s2">oppressive patriarchy and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.380" end="00:55:06.700" style="s2">attributing to women a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.690" end="00:55:09.220" style="s2">temperament in the attempt to continue</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.700" end="00:55:10.900" style="s2">the suppression but I could just as</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.220" end="00:55:15.099" style="s2">easily say it&#39;s like well wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.900" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">like if you want to if you want to give</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.099" end="00:55:19.839" style="s2">the individual the greatest degree of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:21.730" style="s2">freedom you say look you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.839" end="00:55:23.559" style="s2">different from another person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.730" end="00:55:25.540" style="s2">different on the basis of a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.559" end="00:55:27.940" style="s2">your characteristics sex being one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.540" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">them that&#39;s going to have some effect on</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.940" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">what sort of choices you want to make in</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:33.339" style="s2">your life it&#39;s like go ahead and make</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:35.950" style="s2">whatever choices you want as far as</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.339" end="00:55:38.619" style="s2">their a direct expression of your being</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.950" end="00:55:41.260" style="s2">and so if you deny the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.619" end="00:55:44.170" style="s2">these sex differences which no one know</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.260" end="00:55:46.300" style="s2">serious commentator in the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.170" end="00:55:47.470" style="s2">literature in the personality domain and</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.300" end="00:55:47.800" style="s2">those are the people who know about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.470" end="00:55:49.930" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.800" end="00:55:52.180" style="s2">nobody debates whether or not sex</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.930" end="00:55:55.360" style="s2">differences in personality exist or that</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.180" end="00:55:57.340" style="s2">they have a biological component no see</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.360" end="00:55:59.560" style="s2">and what&#39;s also interesting about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.340" end="00:56:03.300" style="s2">is that none of those people are</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.560" end="00:56:05.530" style="s2">conservatives there are no conservative</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.300" end="00:56:07.600" style="s2">psychological researchers to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.530" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">they&#39;re in a tiny minority so the people</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.600" end="00:56:12.010" style="s2">that have done the research indicating</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.810" style="s2">that there are differences between the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.010" end="00:56:16.600" style="s2">sexes and personality and that those</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.810" end="00:56:19.120" style="s2">differences have a biological in part a</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.600" end="00:56:20.860" style="s2">biological component those are liberal</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.120" end="00:56:21.850" style="s2">and left-leaning people who&#39;ve drawn</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.860" end="00:56:23.650" style="s2">those conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.850" end="00:56:25.570" style="s2">despite their you know despite what</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.650" end="00:56:27.130" style="s2">their ideological presuppositions might</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.570" end="00:56:31.690" style="s2">have suggested to them to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.130" end="00:56:33.160" style="s2">so well so you know it&#39;s I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.690" end="00:56:36.430" style="s2">what to say about that except that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.160" end="00:56:38.800" style="s2">it&#39;s all appalling I suppose the fear</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.430" end="00:56:43.870" style="s2">must be that difference will ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.800" end="00:56:46.090" style="s2">be used for leverage for status sure and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.870" end="00:56:47.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a reasonable fear you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.090" end="00:56:51.700" style="s2">because because anything can be</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.980" end="00:56:53.670" style="s2">manipulated but but claims of identity</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.700" end="00:56:56.710" style="s2">can of identity</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.670" end="00:56:58.690" style="s2">that that people are identical in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.710" end="00:57:02.020" style="s2">way can also be used for the same reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.690" end="00:57:04.090" style="s2">you know if I insist that everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.020" end="00:57:05.410" style="s2">exactly the same on all dimensions that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.090" end="00:57:08.050" style="s2">there&#39;s just as much of a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.410" end="00:57:09.640" style="s2">threat lurking in there as there is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.050" end="00:57:10.690" style="s2">threat lurking that will use differences</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.640" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">as an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.690" end="00:57:15.160" style="s2">yeah and we&#39;re also not having a serious</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:17.140" style="s2">discussion about this it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.160" end="00:57:19.570" style="s2">there are men are over represented at</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.140" end="00:57:21.580" style="s2">the top of the economic apex that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.570" end="00:57:23.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a small minority of men by the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.580" end="00:57:25.180" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly not men in general but</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.350" end="00:57:27.010" style="s2">they&#39;re radically underrepresented at</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.180" end="00:57:30.070" style="s2">the board over-represented at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.010" end="00:57:33.070" style="s2">and believe me man like nobody cares</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.070" end="00:57:35.500" style="s2">about men who are failures they are like</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.070" end="00:57:37.090" style="s2">off the bloody radar yeah so and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.500" end="00:57:39.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no sympathy for men who are</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.090" end="00:57:42.520" style="s2">failures so men stack up at the top and</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.820" end="00:57:44.230" style="s2">the bottom and and and we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.520" end="00:57:46.150" style="s2">discussion about that and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.230" end="00:57:48.130" style="s2">a discussion about the fact that women</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.150" end="00:57:51.430" style="s2">are radically underrepresented in</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.130" end="00:57:55.140" style="s2">dangerous jobs although they are or in</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.430" end="00:57:57.539" style="s2">Oran or in in trades that require</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.140" end="00:57:59.459" style="s2">brutal physical labor women are</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.539" end="00:58:01.829" style="s2">radically underrepresented orin orin</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.459" end="00:58:04.559" style="s2">jobs outside women erratically</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.829" end="00:58:06.690" style="s2">underrepresented so the complaint is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.559" end="00:58:08.940" style="s2">always well if you look at the top one</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.690" end="00:58:09.779" style="s2">percent it&#39;s there are more men than</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.940" end="00:58:12.299" style="s2">there should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.779" end="00:58:13.709" style="s2">you know by peer sex division it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.299" end="00:58:16.950" style="s2">well yeah but if you look at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.709" end="00:58:19.380" style="s2">the reverse is true so if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.950" end="00:58:20.999" style="s2">have the discussion which I and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.380" end="00:58:22.680" style="s2">really necessarily think we should have</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.999" end="00:58:24.180" style="s2">that discussion but if we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.680" end="00:58:26.130" style="s2">the discussion then we should look</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.180" end="00:58:28.680" style="s2">across the entire economic spectrum I</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.130" end="00:58:31.589" style="s2">wonder how much of this debate is being</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.680" end="00:58:33.680" style="s2">governed by unconscious forces I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.589" end="00:58:41.430" style="s2">how much of what we&#39;re experiencing is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.680" end="00:58:44.369" style="s2">manifestation of where cartography has</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.430" end="00:58:45.959" style="s2">not yet been well I think a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.369" end="00:58:47.009" style="s2">what are you thinking about any</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.959" end="00:58:50.569" style="s2">particular part of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.009" end="00:58:53.489" style="s2">what I feel like is that the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.569" end="00:58:55.739" style="s2">I imagine that your arguments that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.489" end="00:58:57.930" style="s2">based on research are so successful is</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.739" end="00:59:02.239" style="s2">because people are expressing feelings</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.930" end="00:59:05.880" style="s2">as opposed to cogent and researched</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.239" end="00:59:08.969" style="s2">arguments it feels like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.880" end="00:59:11.699" style="s2">powerful dominant patriarchy and no one</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.969" end="00:59:13.920" style="s2">can deny I mean that there is power</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.699" end="00:59:15.900" style="s2">there&#39;s such a thing as power and there</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.920" end="00:59:18.150" style="s2">are people that benefit from structures</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.900" end="00:59:20.009" style="s2">being as they are course if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.150" end="00:59:22.109" style="s2">point of those structures being the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.009" end="00:59:25.589" style="s2">they are one of the things I&#39;ve observed</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.109" end="00:59:29.249" style="s2">is that whenever change is discussed you</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.589" end="00:59:32.489" style="s2">know and my tendency has always been to</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.249" end="00:59:35.190" style="s2">be sympathetic towards movements that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.489" end="00:59:38.089" style="s2">are about change or empowerment of what</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.190" end="00:59:41.309" style="s2">might be termed disadvantaged groups um</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.089" end="00:59:42.900" style="s2">that changes all that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.309" end="00:59:44.279" style="s2">curious about the resistance of change</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.900" end="00:59:45.719" style="s2">or the different difficulties that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.279" end="00:59:48.059" style="s2">face when trying to bring about change</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.719" end="00:59:50.190" style="s2">look at who would be negatively impacted</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.059" end="00:59:51.930" style="s2">were that change to be brought about and</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.190" end="00:59:54.449" style="s2">usually that means that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.930" end="00:59:56.369" style="s2">people for you know conservatism make</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.449" end="00:59:59.969" style="s2">sense to a particular group of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.369" end="01:00:03.569" style="s2">one things I felt when reading a book</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.969" end="01:00:05.039" style="s2">was that you know like I I because I</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.569" end="01:00:07.499" style="s2">think you&#39;re coming from a perspective</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.039" end="01:00:08.670" style="s2">of psychoanalysis and it rings very the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.499" end="01:00:11.400" style="s2">language rings true</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.670" end="01:00:15.450" style="s2">and the analysis rings true but what I</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.400" end="01:00:16.579" style="s2">wear I feel one question I was keen to</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.450" end="01:00:19.079" style="s2">bring to you is when you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.579" end="01:00:22.049" style="s2">skateboarders in verse I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.079" end="01:00:25.290" style="s2">last but one chapter and that spirit of</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.049" end="01:00:27.960" style="s2">a young people yeah courage and a</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.290" end="01:00:31.109" style="s2">willingness to try dangerous things and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.960" end="01:00:34.260" style="s2">do push forward I wonder how that sits</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.109" end="01:00:35.910" style="s2">with the idea of an earlier passage in</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.260" end="01:00:37.589" style="s2">the book where you talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.910" end="01:00:39.089" style="s2">gratitude that we should feel for you</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.589" end="01:00:41.220" style="s2">know having time to read a book and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.089" end="01:00:42.809" style="s2">ability to read a book and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.220" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">respect for the establishments and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.809" end="01:00:47.220" style="s2">systems that have been set up from which</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:50.670" style="s2">we all benefit you know because when I</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.220" end="01:00:53.490" style="s2">you know I I could find it difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.670" end="01:00:55.740" style="s2">dispute your opinion about sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.490" end="01:00:57.890" style="s2">churlish what would have been in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.740" end="01:01:00.869" style="s2">lexicon of a day social social justice</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.890" end="01:01:06.930" style="s2">warriors and that kind of somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.869" end="01:01:08.040" style="s2">rootless unresearched rage III identify</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.930" end="01:01:10.770" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying they&#39;re people that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.040" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">can&#39;t keep their bedrooms tidy we would</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.770" end="01:01:15.000" style="s2">be careful before you let them organize</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:17.849" style="s2">an economic system but like but but</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.000" end="01:01:20.339" style="s2">similarly like you know where is change</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.849" end="01:01:23.400" style="s2">gonna come from who are who is going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.339" end="01:01:25.740" style="s2">challenge tyranny yeah is it those are</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.400" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">the sorts of twin forces that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.740" end="01:01:28.859" style="s2">contend with across the political</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:30.869" style="s2">spectrum so I could run through</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.859" end="01:01:32.910" style="s2">something quickly to put the things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.869" end="01:01:35.490" style="s2">you just that you just brought up in in</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.910" end="01:01:39.089" style="s2">in perspective let&#39;s say okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.490" end="01:01:41.339" style="s2">first thing is is that hierarchies if</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.089" end="01:01:43.619" style="s2">you&#39;re going to value some things more</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.339" end="01:01:46.140" style="s2">than others then hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.619" end="01:01:47.369" style="s2">inevitable and you have to value some</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.140" end="01:01:49.290" style="s2">things more than others or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.369" end="01:01:51.839" style="s2">have anything well you a low strength or</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.290" end="01:01:53.549" style="s2">something well competence or sure</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.839" end="01:01:56.339" style="s2">whatever whatever it happens to be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.549" end="01:01:58.109" style="s2">ability to play the flute right it</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.339" end="01:02:00.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what I on my list well</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.109" end="01:02:01.859" style="s2">what what you know obviously if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.119" end="01:02:03.210" style="s2">value music then you&#39;re going to value</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.859" end="01:02:05.640" style="s2">some musicians more than others and</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.210" end="01:02:07.170" style="s2">because some are better so is and so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.640" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">have to value things in order to move</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.170" end="01:02:09.990" style="s2">forward in life and you have to value</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:12.329" style="s2">things in order to have something</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.990" end="01:02:13.890" style="s2">valuable to produce but if you play out</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.329" end="01:02:15.480" style="s2">the value in a social landscape you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.890" end="01:02:17.130" style="s2">going to produce a hierarchy and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.480" end="01:02:18.780" style="s2">problem with producing a hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.130" end="01:02:20.430" style="s2">that a small number of people are going</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.780" end="01:02:22.350" style="s2">to be more successful than the majority</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.430" end="01:02:24.030" style="s2">and a very large number of people</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.350" end="01:02:26.550" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to be successful at all at</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.030" end="01:02:29.460" style="s2">that particular thing it&#39;s inevitable so</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.550" end="01:02:30.960" style="s2">okay now so so you must say well we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.460" end="01:02:33.510" style="s2">to put up with that because we need to</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.960" end="01:02:35.100" style="s2">pursue things of value okay fine so</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.510" end="01:02:37.350" style="s2">that&#39;s the right-wing perspective is</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.100" end="01:02:39.510" style="s2">that the hierarchies are justifiable and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.350" end="01:02:40.680" style="s2">necessary now the left-wing perspective</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.510" end="01:02:42.360" style="s2">is yeah but wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.680" end="01:02:43.800" style="s2">the problem with hierarchies is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.360" end="01:02:46.290" style="s2">people stock up at the bottom and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.800" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">they tilt towards tyranny across time</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.290" end="01:02:50.700" style="s2">and that&#39;s also true and so you need</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:53.430" style="s2">that dialectic in society between the</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.700" end="01:02:54.630" style="s2">right wing that says you know we need</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.430" end="01:02:56.280" style="s2">the hierarchies and they&#39;re useful and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.630" end="01:02:58.530" style="s2">you should be grateful for them and they</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.280" end="01:03:00.660" style="s2">structure you and give you form and</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.530" end="01:03:02.970" style="s2">provide value and the left that says</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.660" end="01:03:04.380" style="s2">yeah but they exclude people and people</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.970" end="01:03:07.050" style="s2">stack up at the bottom and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.380" end="01:03:08.520" style="s2">dangerous to the hierarchy itself and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.050" end="01:03:10.440" style="s2">means that people might not have</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.520" end="01:03:13.350" style="s2">opportunity and you have to say yes to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.440" end="01:03:15.510" style="s2">that the problem comes and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.350" end="01:03:17.910" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in right now where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.510" end="01:03:20.040" style="s2">radical leftists and this is mostly a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.910" end="01:03:22.080" style="s2">problem that really permeates the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.040" end="01:03:24.120" style="s2">universities the radical left to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.080" end="01:03:26.070" style="s2">yeah but all hierarchies are just</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.120" end="01:03:28.680" style="s2">tyrannical power it&#39;s like oh no they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.070" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">not hierarchies are based on competence</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.680" end="01:03:33.720" style="s2">in a functioning society and mostly our</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">society functions so you need it you</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.720" end="01:03:40.050" style="s2">can&#39;t go that far now that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:42.030" style="s2">that that hierarchies don&#39;t tilt towards</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.050" end="01:03:44.070" style="s2">self-interest and tyranny across time</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.030" end="01:03:45.560" style="s2">but that&#39;s a bad thing it&#39;s even a bad</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.070" end="01:03:50.640" style="s2">thing from the conservative perspective</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.560" end="01:03:53.370" style="s2">so well so there&#39;s room for the left</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.299" end="01:06:21.299" style="s2">these decisions made and as you say</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.089" end="01:06:23.130" style="s2">among the dispossessed there is there a</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.299" end="01:06:25.140" style="s2">great resources great talent one would</p>

<p begin="01:06:27.089" end="01:06:31.770" style="s2">and talent among the possessed because</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.520" end="01:06:33.480" style="s2">it&#39;s normally an accident of birth that</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.770" end="01:06:36.390" style="s2">decrees and reading about your early</p>

<p begin="01:06:50.010" end="01:06:56.790" style="s2">like that for me we that are rising</p>

<p begin="01:06:56.790" end="01:07:00.780" style="s2">experiences of both side of that line</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.830" end="01:07:03.000" style="s2">well we are now challenging this</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.780" end="01:07:05.100" style="s2">evolutionary force we are now in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.000" end="01:07:06.660" style="s2">position to talk about these hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.100" end="01:07:09.119" style="s2">how they&#39;re ordered and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.660" end="01:07:11.609" style="s2">organized and whether there is room for</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.119" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">negotiation well it&#39;s up to us to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.609" end="01:07:15.750" style="s2">that we love housing we think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:17.550" style="s2">risking conservatism is saying well this</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.750" end="01:07:19.619" style="s2">is how the cards have fallen and of</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.550" end="01:07:21.960" style="s2">course that is the risk and conservatism</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.619" end="01:07:25.890" style="s2">so how do you use confront that well the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.960" end="01:07:27.720" style="s2">risk is the the the hierarchies ossify</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.890" end="01:07:30.240" style="s2">and turn to stone and then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.720" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">mobility and and the idea that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.240" end="01:07:33.480" style="s2">things can turn to stone and they become</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.920" end="01:07:36.300" style="s2">tyrannical is an extraordinarily old</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.480" end="01:07:38.310" style="s2">idea for example in in the story of</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.300" end="01:07:40.590" style="s2">Exodus the story of Moses so the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.310" end="01:07:44.460" style="s2">Egyptian the Egyptians are portrayed in</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.590" end="01:07:46.590" style="s2">that story as tyrannical conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.460" end="01:07:49.290" style="s2">essentially right and they&#39;re masters of</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.590" end="01:07:51.420" style="s2">stone and Moses is a master of water and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.290" end="01:07:52.950" style="s2">water is the thing that dissolves and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.420" end="01:07:54.480" style="s2">that dramas being played out in these</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.950" end="01:07:56.430" style="s2">stories that are thousands of years old</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.480" end="01:07:58.280" style="s2">and in the Egyptian story the ancient</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.430" end="01:08:01.950" style="s2">Egyptian story of Osiris and Horus</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.280" end="01:08:03.930" style="s2">Osiris is the old king who becomes too</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.950" end="01:08:06.540" style="s2">rigid and what happens to him is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.930" end="01:08:08.250" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s dismembered by evil that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.540" end="01:08:10.530" style="s2">consequence and so even the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.250" end="01:08:12.510" style="s2">long ago knew that the danger of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.530" end="01:08:15.510" style="s2">hierarchies is they become static and</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.510" end="01:08:17.040" style="s2">corrupt and tyrannical and so part of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.510" end="01:08:19.980" style="s2">what we do in our ongoing political</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.040" end="01:08:22.080" style="s2">dialogue and and and when it&#39;s genuine</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.980" end="01:08:24.239" style="s2">dialogue is to say well look are these</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.080" end="01:08:26.190" style="s2">do these systems have it we need them</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.239" end="01:08:28.620" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re not avoidable but do</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.190" end="01:08:30.450" style="s2">they are they functioning properly are</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.620" end="01:08:32.520" style="s2">they loose enough so that people can</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.450" end="01:08:35.400" style="s2">move are they are they serving the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.520" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">broader good or have they degenerated</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.400" end="01:08:39.690" style="s2">into something that&#39;s too tyrannical now</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:41.190" style="s2">you know you you kind of pointed to both</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.690" end="01:08:42.989" style="s2">of those in the way you formulated that</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.190" end="01:08:45.239" style="s2">question because you said look well my</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.989" end="01:08:48.150" style="s2">mom was in the hospital and she needed</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.239" end="01:08:50.580" style="s2">care and so and I found a surgeon who</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.150" end="01:08:52.290" style="s2">was an excellent surgeon and so so what</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.580" end="01:08:56.730" style="s2">you did there basically was take about</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.290" end="01:08:58.890" style="s2">two the you bowed before the functional</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.730" end="01:09:00.569" style="s2">hierarchy of the hospital and said look</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.890" end="01:09:01.950" style="s2">the greatest surgeon actually rose to</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.569" end="01:09:03.389" style="s2">the top and thank God for that because</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.950" end="01:09:05.520" style="s2">otherwise my mother would be dead</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.389" end="01:09:08.069" style="s2">it&#39;s like yes that&#39;s our competency</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.520" end="01:09:09.989" style="s2">hierarchy and it could be contaminated</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.069" end="01:09:12.060" style="s2">by tyranny in which case it would be the</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.989" end="01:09:14.040" style="s2">brother of some powerful person who</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.060" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">ended up with a surgical position right</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.040" end="01:09:17.400" style="s2">and then everyone dies and that does</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:20.009" style="s2">happen in many many cultures where</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.400" end="01:09:22.529" style="s2">nepotism or connections define your</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.009" end="01:09:24.119" style="s2">position on every axis but then you said</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.529" end="01:09:26.009" style="s2">well but I went out of the hospital and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.119" end="01:09:28.380" style="s2">I was driving down the road and I saw</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.009" end="01:09:30.299" style="s2">what appeared to be a micelle ocation of</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.380" end="01:09:31.889" style="s2">resources and what we have to do about</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.299" end="01:09:33.420" style="s2">that is have it have a discussion about</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.889" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2">it constantly it&#39;s like are we</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.420" end="01:09:39.389" style="s2">allocating resources to the appropriate</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.389" end="01:09:45.409" style="s2">problem there is to what degree do we</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.319" end="01:09:50.100" style="s2">decide about the allocation of resources</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.409" end="01:09:51.600" style="s2">by voluntary effort by planning and to</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.909" end="01:10:03.900" style="s2">people talk about it like it&#39;s a neutral</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.679" end="01:10:06.750" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s just a conglomeration of</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.900" end="01:10:08.369" style="s2">interests of the powerful well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.750" end="01:10:10.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a bunch of things I mean it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.369" end="01:10:12.780" style="s2">it can be that but it can also be the</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.830" end="01:10:14.070" style="s2">way that we collectively value things</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.780" end="01:10:15.239" style="s2">like let me give you an example</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.070" end="01:10:16.800" style="s2">look at our collective values and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.239" end="01:10:19.889" style="s2">just quickly say this yeah I heard this</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.800" end="01:10:22.679" style="s2">thing in in Sweden they can&#39;t regulate</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.889" end="01:10:24.780" style="s2">and control access to alcohol at a state</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.679" end="01:10:26.850" style="s2">level like off licences or liquor stores</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.780" end="01:10:28.260" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of socially run and like</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.850" end="01:10:29.909" style="s2">and they&#39;re not allowed to be advertised</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.260" end="01:10:32.190" style="s2">in Sweden do you know Sweden I guess is</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.909" end="01:10:33.420" style="s2">one of those havens of what you might</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.190" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">guy don&#39;t know what your views are</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.420" end="01:10:37.770" style="s2">Sweden but I see a lot of stories about</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:40.050" style="s2">Sweden it seemed a bit like pegs with</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.770" end="01:10:42.030" style="s2">Sweden comes across as I guess I sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.050" end="01:10:45.030" style="s2">this sort of postmodern democracy almost</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.030" end="01:10:46.530" style="s2">in some respects anyhow like I thought</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.030" end="01:10:49.050" style="s2">it&#39;s curious that they control alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.530" end="01:10:50.730" style="s2">in that manner and I am envisaged that</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.050" end="01:10:52.199" style="s2">sort of breweries and liquor</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.730" end="01:10:54.449" style="s2">distributors would say hey that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.199" end="01:10:57.239" style="s2">free market you&#39;re controlling access to</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.449" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">you know people&#39;s access to alcohol as</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.239" end="01:11:03.719" style="s2">if somehow the free market was neutral</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.719" end="01:11:05.550" style="s2">but there is no neutral if the market is</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.719" end="01:11:08.130" style="s2">what has the power people&#39;s desires will</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.550" end="01:11:09.690" style="s2">be overly stimulated people in people</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.130" end="01:11:11.550" style="s2">like if people that have McDonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.690" end="01:11:13.500" style="s2">advertised that they&#39;re more alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.550" end="01:11:15.690" style="s2">advertised at them people will bloody</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.500" end="01:11:16.710" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s and alcohol there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.690" end="01:11:18.750" style="s2">some moral</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.710" end="01:11:20.430" style="s2">in force there has to be something</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.750" end="01:11:23.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not economically led that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.430" end="01:11:26.340" style="s2">the manifestation of greed that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.520" end="01:11:29.280" style="s2">conversation someone in a secular</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.340" end="01:11:31.950" style="s2">society where there is no reasonable or</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.280" end="01:11:36.330" style="s2">trusted voice of God have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.950" end="01:11:39.870" style="s2">say don&#39;t worry too much people will</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.330" end="01:11:43.170" style="s2">okay so so see I think I think the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.870" end="01:11:47.610" style="s2">effective solution to that problem is to</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.170" end="01:11:49.860" style="s2">have the economic system run let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.610" end="01:11:52.440" style="s2">by distributed individuals who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.860" end="01:11:53.940" style="s2">themselves aiming at a higher good so I</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.440" end="01:11:55.650" style="s2">think the way that you the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.940" end="01:11:58.170" style="s2">effective way of regulating the market</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.650" end="01:11:59.610" style="s2">so to speak is to improve the moral</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.170" end="01:12:01.620" style="s2">character of the people who make up the</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.610" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">market rather than directly regulating</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.620" end="01:12:06.989" style="s2">the market and not that the market</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:08.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily need some regulation</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.989" end="01:12:10.710" style="s2">because you might say well how about we</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.610" end="01:12:13.230" style="s2">don&#39;t devote alcohol advertising to</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.710" end="01:12:14.489" style="s2">children under ten most people would</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.230" end="01:12:16.380" style="s2">agree that that&#39;s a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.489" end="01:12:18.239" style="s2">perspective and so that is limitation on</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.380" end="01:12:21.690" style="s2">market forces and there are places that</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.239" end="01:12:24.680" style="s2">you can find that that that limitation</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.690" end="01:12:27.300" style="s2">being accepted by almost anyone but but</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.680" end="01:12:29.880" style="s2">the part of what you&#39;re pointing to is</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.300" end="01:12:32.130" style="s2">that if the only thing that&#39;s governing</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.880" end="01:12:34.320" style="s2">the market is concerned for pure market</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.130" end="01:12:36.360" style="s2">success then the market can produce all</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.320" end="01:12:38.550" style="s2">sorts of excesses but I think what you</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.360" end="01:12:41.550" style="s2">want you want what you want is to help</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.550" end="01:12:45.989" style="s2">orient people towards a transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.550" end="01:12:48.060" style="s2">good that&#39;s oh that&#39;s over and above</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.989" end="01:12:49.860" style="s2">market interest so you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.060" end="01:12:51.090" style="s2">what interests should you serve as</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.860" end="01:12:52.560" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to be successful as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.090" end="01:12:54.810" style="s2">comedian there and while you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.560" end="01:12:55.980" style="s2">to make a living as a comedian say you</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.810" end="01:12:57.840" style="s2">might want to make sure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.980" end="01:12:59.160" style="s2">conducting yourself appropriately in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.840" end="01:13:01.440" style="s2">marketplace you&#39;re concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.160" end="01:13:03.120" style="s2">yourself but also your future selves</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.440" end="01:13:04.230" style="s2">because you have to take and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.120" end="01:13:05.910" style="s2">partly why addiction is such a</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.230" end="01:13:07.620" style="s2">catastrophe right because it&#39;s great in</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.910" end="01:13:09.540" style="s2">the short term but it&#39;s not so good in</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.620" end="01:13:12.300" style="s2">the medium to long run so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.540" end="01:13:14.219" style="s2">take care of yourself and and your your</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.300" end="01:13:15.630" style="s2">iterations through the future you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.219" end="01:13:17.460" style="s2">to take care of yourself in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.630" end="01:13:19.050" style="s2">you&#39;re taking care of your family you</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.460" end="01:13:20.489" style="s2">have to take care of yourself and your</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.050" end="01:13:21.870" style="s2">family in a way that you&#39;re benefiting</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.489" end="01:13:23.969" style="s2">the community and that should be</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.870" end="01:13:25.890" style="s2">foremost in your mind so then when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.969" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">start to make economic decisions even in</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.890" end="01:13:29.100" style="s2">your business you&#39;re not saying well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:30.479" style="s2">going to do whatever I can to make as</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.100" end="01:13:32.309" style="s2">much money as I can</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.479" end="01:13:33.929" style="s2">you&#39;re going to say I&#39;m going to do</p>

<p begin="01:13:33.929" end="01:13:38.340" style="s2">I can well also making sure that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:13:43.739" end="01:13:47.130" style="s2">that and serving it properly and then I</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.869" end="01:13:49.469" style="s2">think the market can work more</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.130" end="01:13:51.749" style="s2">effectively but still might require some</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.469" end="01:13:53.249" style="s2">some discussion around the edges because</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.749" end="01:13:55.110" style="s2">you know nothing is simple</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.249" end="01:13:56.849" style="s2">so the reap the reason that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.110" end="01:13:58.590" style="s2">concentrating on the individual and</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.849" end="01:14:00.209" style="s2">individual development is because I</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.590" end="01:14:02.729" style="s2">think that&#39;s the best way to do that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.209" end="01:14:04.349" style="s2">regulation I think that&#39;s important I</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.729" end="01:14:07.559" style="s2">think it&#39;s non-negotiable I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.349" end="01:14:09.690" style="s2">necessary but I also believe that if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.559" end="01:14:12.209" style="s2">have a society that&#39;s predicated on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.690" end="01:14:15.570" style="s2">some of the worst aspects of human</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.420" end="01:21:43.080" style="s2">reflection of this universal process</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.250" end="01:21:45.929" style="s2">that you just described it I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.080" end="01:21:48.390" style="s2">the most powerful form of transformation</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.929" end="01:21:50.850" style="s2">but more importantly I also think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.390" end="01:21:52.980" style="s2">the one that risks doing the least harm</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.850" end="01:21:55.409" style="s2">like it hasn&#39;t hurt anybody that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.980" end="01:21:57.480" style="s2">put yourself together it&#39;s just good</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.409" end="01:21:59.280" style="s2">right it&#39;s good for you it&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.480" end="01:22:01.500" style="s2">the people that know you there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.280" end="01:22:04.980" style="s2">about it and it&#39;s it&#39;s the right level</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.500" end="01:22:07.560" style="s2">of humility because you took what you</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.980" end="01:22:10.110" style="s2">knew to be wrong in your experience you</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.560" end="01:22:12.659" style="s2">took personal responsibility for it you</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.110" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">made changes for yourself you didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.659" end="01:22:15.870" style="s2">around pointing the finger at what was</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:18.570" style="s2">wrong with the external world and trying</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.870" end="01:22:21.000" style="s2">to fix it now look it could easily be</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.570" end="01:22:23.370" style="s2">that once you have your act together or</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.000" end="01:22:24.600" style="s2">maybe even before you should be doing</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.370" end="01:22:26.340" style="s2">some things too</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.600" end="01:22:28.200" style="s2">adjust political systems or sociological</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.340" end="01:22:30.180" style="s2">systems but the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.200" end="01:22:32.580" style="s2">what makes you think you can trust</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.180" end="01:22:34.560" style="s2">yourself hmm you know and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.580" end="01:22:36.480" style="s2">I&#39;m compassionate Slyke maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.560" end="01:22:38.490" style="s2">you&#39;re also envious of the successful</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.480" end="01:22:40.590" style="s2">and the probability if that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.490" end="01:22:43.230" style="s2">damn high by the way and so you better</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.590" end="01:22:44.430" style="s2">know before you express that compassion</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.230" end="01:22:46.770" style="s2">especially in the political domain</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.430" end="01:22:48.300" style="s2">whether or not that is contaminated by</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.770" end="01:22:50.280" style="s2">things about yourself that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.300" end="01:22:53.400" style="s2">contended with do you think an honest</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.280" end="01:22:55.410" style="s2">declaration or along those lines or</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.400" end="01:22:58.320" style="s2">specifically that in the political field</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.410" end="01:23:00.180" style="s2">would be refreshing look I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.320" end="01:23:02.460" style="s2">one of the very funny things so the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.180" end="01:23:04.110" style="s2">ancient the emperor of ancient</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.460" end="01:23:05.730" style="s2">Mesopotamia so this is some of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.110" end="01:23:07.650" style="s2">earliest political documentation we have</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.730" end="01:23:10.590" style="s2">by the way here&#39;s what they used to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.650" end="01:23:12.120" style="s2">to the emperor every New Year&#39;s Day they</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.590" end="01:23:14.670" style="s2">would take him outside the walls of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.120" end="01:23:16.260" style="s2">city so he was responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.670" end="01:23:18.240" style="s2">everything within the walls outside was</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.260" end="01:23:20.370" style="s2">chaos and the unknown they take him</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.240" end="01:23:22.410" style="s2">outside the city they&#39;d strip him of all</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.370" end="01:23:23.130" style="s2">his emperor garb so he&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.410" end="01:23:25.290" style="s2">Emperor</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.130" end="01:23:26.850" style="s2">they&#39;d make him kneel they&#39;d humiliate</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.290" end="01:23:28.290" style="s2">him I think the if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.850" end="01:23:33.270" style="s2">the priest would hit him with a glove</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.290" end="01:23:35.490" style="s2">and say okay in the last year how named</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.270" end="01:23:37.800" style="s2">all the ways that you didn&#39;t embody</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.490" end="01:23:39.930" style="s2">Marduk Marduk was the god of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.800" end="01:23:41.460" style="s2">Mesopotamians and Marduk was the thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.930" end="01:23:43.710" style="s2">that took on the great dragon of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.460" end="01:23:45.870" style="s2">and so it was the it was the</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.710" end="01:23:48.120" style="s2">responsibility of the Emperor to to</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.870" end="01:23:51.030" style="s2">kneel down and say here&#39;s all the ways</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.120" end="01:23:52.830" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t been acting out my proper</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.030" end="01:23:54.930" style="s2">self and have brought the kingdom into</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.830" end="01:23:57.030" style="s2">disarray and then he would be forgiven</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.930" end="01:23:58.440" style="s2">they would act out the reconstruction of</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.030" end="01:24:00.630" style="s2">the cosmos that was the New Year&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.440" end="01:24:02.790" style="s2">celebration and then he&#39;d go in and try</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.630" end="01:24:04.680" style="s2">to be a good king all right so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.790" end="01:24:06.660" style="s2">no kidding absolutely it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.680" end="01:24:07.770" style="s2">confession of the Emperor here&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.660" end="01:24:11.910" style="s2">I haven&#39;t been good</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.770" end="01:24:14.100" style="s2">are there any comparable of the powerful</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.910" end="01:24:16.650" style="s2">held up for that kind of evaluation in</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.100" end="01:24:18.090" style="s2">we don&#39;t have rituals for that well I</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.650" end="01:24:20.090" style="s2">suppose we don&#39;t acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.090" end="01:24:23.640" style="s2">emergence of order from chaos we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.090" end="01:24:25.260" style="s2">emerge acknowledge Divine Principle so</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.640" end="01:24:26.730" style="s2">the powerful and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.260" end="01:24:28.890" style="s2">possibly because of it assumed</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.730" end="01:24:29.970" style="s2">meritocracy you know people that are in</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.890" end="01:24:31.140" style="s2">positions of power they&#39;re there for</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.970" end="01:24:33.180" style="s2">reason you don&#39;t need it&#39;s not stripping</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.140" end="01:24:34.800" style="s2">them naked and take that say how often</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.180" end="01:24:37.370" style="s2">did you wank in that Oval Office yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.800" end="01:24:37.370" style="s2">every day</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.640" end="01:24:41.660" style="s2">well I I think there might be something</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.950" end="01:24:43.070" style="s2">to that and that&#39;s the danger of pride</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.660" end="01:24:44.870" style="s2">that goes along with ascension and</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.070" end="01:24:46.700" style="s2">hierarchy well because I&#39;m here in this</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.870" end="01:24:48.320" style="s2">position I must deserve it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.700" end="01:24:50.330" style="s2">yeah but there should still be something</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.320" end="01:24:52.550" style="s2">that you&#39;re bowing down to and that</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.330" end="01:24:54.380" style="s2">might be the abstract idea of sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.550" end="01:24:56.390" style="s2">Authority itself if you think about it</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.380" end="01:24:59.690" style="s2">only psychologically that&#39;s a figure</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.390" end="01:25:02.090" style="s2">that essentially has a touch of divinity</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.690" end="01:25:04.160" style="s2">about it because it&#39;s the modifier on a</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.090" end="01:25:07.040" style="s2">key right now huh so that&#39;s the between</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.160" end="01:25:08.900" style="s2">the anointed and appointed monarch she</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.040" end="01:25:10.790" style="s2">represents unity I suppose in a post</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.900" end="01:25:14.420" style="s2">secular nation she becomes the emblem of</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.790" end="01:25:16.040" style="s2">Britain rather than the emblem of God on</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.420" end="01:25:18.230" style="s2">right well I think I think it actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.040" end="01:25:20.120" style="s2">functions to some degree in defence well</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.230" end="01:25:21.800" style="s2">I do think so because the Queen your</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.120" end="01:25:23.390" style="s2">queen in particular our queen as well</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.800" end="01:25:27.980" style="s2">because I&#39;m a Canadian 18 you know I</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.390" end="01:25:29.540" style="s2">mean I think Elizabeth has been an</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.980" end="01:25:31.580" style="s2">embodiment of moral virtue</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.540" end="01:25:33.980" style="s2">I mean she&#39;s done a remarkable job over</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.580" end="01:25:35.750" style="s2">the last what is it 75 years now she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.980" end="01:25:37.490" style="s2">held herself to an incredibly high moral</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.750" end="01:25:39.700" style="s2">standard and I think she does sit in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.490" end="01:25:41.870" style="s2">background as emblematic of what</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.700" end="01:25:43.850" style="s2">sovereign Authority might look like but</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.870" end="01:25:45.470" style="s2">of course you&#39;re postmodernist and this</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.850" end="01:25:46.610" style="s2">is an area where because I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.470" end="01:25:48.320" style="s2">English and I can&#39;t get away from the</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.610" end="01:25:51.410" style="s2">love of the Queen but I would also say</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.320" end="01:25:53.660" style="s2">that she is an emblem of authority and</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.410" end="01:25:56.750" style="s2">of power and of wealth and land</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.660" end="01:25:59.630" style="s2">ownership and there is that there is an</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.750" end="01:26:01.700" style="s2">order that all be respected and can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.630" end="01:26:02.930" style="s2">challenged every so often this country</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.700" end="01:26:04.340" style="s2">sort of toys with the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.930" end="01:26:05.600" style="s2">republicanism they&#39;re always grateful</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.340" end="01:26:07.670" style="s2">when there&#39;s a wedding right there is</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.600" end="01:26:10.240" style="s2">this week so that no one has to think is</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.670" end="01:26:13.520" style="s2">it right that we&#39;re angry this bizarre</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.240" end="01:26:15.260" style="s2">spectacle yeah well but it is useful to</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.520" end="01:26:16.640" style="s2">think about it in a symbolic sense I</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.260" end="01:26:18.470" style="s2">mean one of the things that constantly</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.640" end="01:26:19.910" style="s2">threatens the United States I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.470" end="01:26:23.380" style="s2">there should be four branches of</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.910" end="01:26:26.990" style="s2">government legislative judicial</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.380" end="01:26:28.370" style="s2">executive and symbolic because the</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.990" end="01:26:30.710" style="s2">problem in the United States is the</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.370" end="01:26:32.360" style="s2">president keeps tilting towards King you</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.710" end="01:26:34.460" style="s2">know the Americans like the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.360" end="01:26:38.480" style="s2">first family and the first lady and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.460" end="01:26:40.070" style="s2">like yeah no and it kind of tilts</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.480" end="01:26:41.960" style="s2">towards a dynasty and you&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.070" end="01:26:43.940" style="s2">happen with bushes and the Clintons and</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.960" end="01:26:46.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s not a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.940" end="01:26:48.380" style="s2">and it might be nice to have someone</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.220" end="01:26:50.120" style="s2">take the symbolic load off the President</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.380" end="01:26:51.349" style="s2">and just act that out and your queen</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.120" end="01:26:53.239" style="s2">does that very nicely</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.349" end="01:26:55.460" style="s2">because all of the pomp and circumstance</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.239" end="01:26:57.469" style="s2">of the state and all the drama and</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.460" end="01:26:59.300" style="s2">ritual of the sovereign can be played</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.469" end="01:27:01.610" style="s2">out in that sort of dramatic space and</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.300" end="01:27:03.260" style="s2">your legislature and executive branches</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.610" end="01:27:07.310" style="s2">can go off and do the administration</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.260" end="01:27:09.639" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that the the dynasties</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.310" end="01:27:11.449" style="s2">exert themselves in a sense it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.639" end="01:27:12.980" style="s2">demonstration of your argument that</p>

<p begin="01:29:16.219" end="01:29:19.610" style="s2">it&#39;s an archery term so that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.230" end="01:29:21.019" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting way of</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.610" end="01:29:22.730" style="s2">thinking about it because it means that</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.019" end="01:29:24.739" style="s2">there is a talking there is a target</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.730" end="01:29:26.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing but the next thing is</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.739" end="01:29:28.639" style="s2">and in this gun this comes right out of</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.210" end="01:29:31.099" style="s2">that is it&#39;s very useful to become aware</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.639" end="01:29:32.869" style="s2">of your faults because as soon as you</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.099" end="01:29:35.210" style="s2">pause it a fault you pause it the</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.869" end="01:29:35.659" style="s2">opposite by merely saying well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.210" end="01:29:37.070" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.659" end="01:29:38.449" style="s2">you&#39;re saying implicitly well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.070" end="01:29:40.550" style="s2">something that&#39;s the opposite of that so</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.449" end="01:29:42.650" style="s2">out of your recognition of faults</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.550" end="01:29:45.199" style="s2">immediately some clarity of virtue</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.650" end="01:29:46.730" style="s2">develops because you might say well this</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.199" end="01:29:48.559" style="s2">is a fault and I really know it it&#39;s oh</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.730" end="01:29:50.780" style="s2">great you&#39;ve got some bedrock there</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.559" end="01:29:52.579" style="s2">whatever the opposite of that fault is</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.780" end="01:29:54.380" style="s2">you might not know what that is but</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.579" end="01:29:56.599" style="s2">whatever the opposite of that fault is</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.380" end="01:29:59.329" style="s2">is a virtue and then you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.599" end="01:30:01.730" style="s2">I have 20 faults it&#39;s like great the</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.329" end="01:30:04.130" style="s2">opposite of the personality that has all</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.730" end="01:30:06.170" style="s2">those 20 faults is the virtuous you</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.130" end="01:30:07.730" style="s2">whatever that might happen to be well</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.170" end="01:30:11.059" style="s2">great then you&#39;ve then you&#39;ve conjured</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.730" end="01:30:14.650" style="s2">out of the devil I&#39;m a redeemer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.059" end="01:30:18.619" style="s2">something like that I like that and the</p>

<p begin="01:30:18.619" end="01:30:25.250" style="s2">and fleeting morality there is chaos</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.610" end="01:30:27.409" style="s2">there is vastness but there are also</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.250" end="01:30:29.869" style="s2">patterns there are patterns that emerge</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.409" end="01:30:33.679" style="s2">and whether you call that pattern mail</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.869" end="01:30:35.929" style="s2">or love or beauty there are various</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.679" end="01:30:37.880" style="s2">patterns and I feel that there there is</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.929" end="01:30:40.280" style="s2">something to get in alignment with there</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.880" end="01:30:44.269" style="s2">is attune there is harmony there is</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.280" end="01:30:48.429" style="s2">melody there is grace we&#39;re not and all</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.269" end="01:30:48.429" style="s2">you&#39;re using there are musical musical</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.150" end="01:30:54.230" style="s2">that&#39;s what music expresses is to have</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.130" end="01:30:56.179" style="s2">all of that in harmony yeah a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.230" end="01:30:58.010" style="s2">musics because of that you know in those</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.179" end="01:31:00.199" style="s2">patterns because music you think about</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.010" end="01:31:02.239" style="s2">music it is the harmonious interaction</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.199" end="01:31:05.119" style="s2">of patterns and you just described all</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.239" end="01:31:06.679" style="s2">those positive what would you call them</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.119" end="01:31:08.510" style="s2">spirits that&#39;s a good way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.679" end="01:31:10.010" style="s2">about it as patterns or they are</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.510" end="01:31:11.869" style="s2">patterns then you might think that</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.010" end="01:31:13.489" style="s2">there&#39;s a pattern that&#39;s composed of all</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.869" end="01:31:15.440" style="s2">of those patterns well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.489" end="01:31:17.659" style="s2">you&#39;re after here is a pattern that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.440" end="01:31:18.470" style="s2">composed of all those patterns yes</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.659" end="01:31:19.730" style="s2">absolutely and</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.470" end="01:31:21.470" style="s2">you want to put yourself in harmony with</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.730" end="01:31:24.230" style="s2">that and that is a real thing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.470" end="01:31:26.840" style="s2">real thing you can feel that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.230" end="01:31:29.000" style="s2">what keeps you alive essentially when</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.840" end="01:31:30.890" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to become conscious yes</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.000" end="01:31:32.960" style="s2">yes there is something important</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.890" end="01:31:35.120" style="s2">happening I feel like what we were</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.960" end="01:31:37.840" style="s2">saying before about the acknowledgment</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.120" end="01:31:40.750" style="s2">of difference and needin info</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.840" end="01:31:43.070" style="s2">inferiority that is something that</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.750" end="01:31:46.010" style="s2">definitely what we should be actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.070" end="01:31:47.840" style="s2">well this is part of what the radical</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.010" end="01:31:50.540" style="s2">leftists keep saying is what we should</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.840" end="01:31:52.340" style="s2">celebrate diversity it&#39;s like yes but</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.540" end="01:31:54.890" style="s2">what that means first is the admission</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.340" end="01:31:56.690" style="s2">that people actually differ you know as</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.890" end="01:31:58.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t have diversity it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.690" end="01:32:01.460" style="s2">glad there are conservatives I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.760" end="01:32:04.940" style="s2">there are leftists the conservatives run</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.460" end="01:32:06.920" style="s2">things the leftists invent them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.940" end="01:32:08.870" style="s2">like good and they&#39;re really different</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.920" end="01:32:10.220" style="s2">those people like you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.870" end="01:32:11.660" style="s2">have a group that&#39;s all conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.220" end="01:32:13.250" style="s2">and they&#39;re going down the right path</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.660" end="01:32:15.020" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna go down that path really</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.250" end="01:32:16.310" style="s2">fast but if they&#39;re going down the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.020" end="01:32:17.870" style="s2">path they&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.310" end="01:32:19.730" style="s2">think laterally and figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.870" end="01:32:21.980" style="s2">get out of it if you have a group of</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.730" end="01:32:23.120" style="s2">left-leaning creative types it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.980" end="01:32:25.580" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna come up with a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.120" end="01:32:27.980" style="s2">ideas but the probability that they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.580" end="01:32:30.380" style="s2">organize in a stable hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.980" end="01:32:32.150" style="s2">implement those effectively is zero</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.380" end="01:32:34.100" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have to call over the</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.150" end="01:32:36.260" style="s2">Conservatives it&#39;s like look guys we</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.100" end="01:32:38.660" style="s2">finally got a good idea you can have one</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.260" end="01:32:40.250" style="s2">idea because you&#39;re conservatives run</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.660" end="01:32:42.350" style="s2">with it and then they can all run with</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.250" end="01:32:44.390" style="s2">it and so it&#39;s really good that we have</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.350" end="01:32:46.010" style="s2">people who are like that on both sides</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.390" end="01:32:48.890" style="s2">of the distribution because otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.010" end="01:32:50.720" style="s2">the the creative types would sit around</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.890" end="01:32:53.180" style="s2">and come up with new ideas till they</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.720" end="01:32:55.070" style="s2">starve to death in squalor and thought</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.180" end="01:32:57.740" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah well exactly and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.070" end="01:33:00.740" style="s2">Conservatives would just ossify and and</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.740" end="01:33:02.270" style="s2">you know run down a road that got narrow</p>
