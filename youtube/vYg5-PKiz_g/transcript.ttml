<p begin="00:00:09.220" end="00:00:17.210" style="s2">hey guys so we are joined by Mike and UV</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.120" end="00:00:18.920" style="s2">of the future thinkers podcast and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.210" end="00:00:21.230" style="s2">probably overdue to be honest that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.920" end="00:00:23.240" style="s2">connect because we&#39;re in very similar</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.230" end="00:00:25.610" style="s2">areas we speak to a lot of the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.240" end="00:00:27.710" style="s2">people I&#39;m really interested to hear</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.610" end="00:00:30.320" style="s2">from you guys what you&#39;ve learned from</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.710" end="00:00:31.730" style="s2">those conversations and how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.320" end="00:00:33.559" style="s2">influenced what you&#39;re doing because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.730" end="00:00:35.330" style="s2">know that there&#39;s probably quite similar</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.559" end="00:00:38.300" style="s2">journeys and yeah I&#39;m really intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.330" end="00:00:39.760" style="s2">to hear how that&#39;s been and maybe if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.300" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">could just start by introducing</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.760" end="00:00:45.950" style="s2">yourselves and how you feel that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:47.480" style="s2">the future thinkers podcast has evolved</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.950" end="00:00:50.899" style="s2">over the last few years since you</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.480" end="00:00:52.820" style="s2">started doing it sure and likewise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.899" end="00:00:55.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve been very intrigued by what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.820" end="00:00:57.649" style="s2">guys are doing and it&#39;s been actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.280" end="00:00:59.390" style="s2">really nice and refreshing to see you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.649" end="00:01:00.829" style="s2">putting out this content I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.390" end="00:01:05.690" style="s2">a huge necessity for it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.829" end="00:01:07.940" style="s2">so yeah I honestly think that the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.690" end="00:01:10.820" style="s2">more of the these conversations are out</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.940" end="00:01:15.560" style="s2">there the better because they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.820" end="00:01:19.970" style="s2">happening so as far as future thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.560" end="00:01:23.110" style="s2">goes we started in 2013 in the end of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.970" end="00:01:25.940" style="s2">2013 we recorded our first episode and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.110" end="00:01:27.740" style="s2">it started because Mike and I were just</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.940" end="00:01:29.750" style="s2">having interesting conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.740" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">each other every morning over coffee and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.750" end="00:01:34.670" style="s2">we had a bunch of friends who had</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:38.420" style="s2">podcasts they were mostly business</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.670" end="00:01:40.550" style="s2">podcasts but we thought why not start</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.420" end="00:01:43.099" style="s2">our own podcast but that wasn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.550" end="00:01:44.599" style="s2">business it was just about us you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.099" end="00:01:48.740" style="s2">talking philosophy with each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.599" end="00:01:50.810" style="s2">navel-gazing philosophy yeah and we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.740" end="00:01:52.160" style="s2">actually kind of started off doing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.810" end="00:01:53.899" style="s2">digital Nomad thing we read that book</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.160" end="00:01:55.459" style="s2">4-hour workweek and kind of use that as</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.899" end="00:01:57.860" style="s2">a road map for running a business</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.459" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">traveling and we we left bought one-way</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.860" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">tickets to Thailand in 2013 and then you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:06.380" style="s2">know we&#39;d so it sold Tim Ferriss is both</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:08.020" style="s2">it is really but we were interested in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.380" end="00:02:10.789" style="s2">lot of the subjects you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.020" end="00:02:13.610" style="s2">philosophical psychedelic kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.789" end="00:02:15.560" style="s2">know those weird navel-gazing subjects</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.610" end="00:02:18.170" style="s2">so we ended up having a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:19.909" style="s2">conversations when we had kind of bought</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.170" end="00:02:22.010" style="s2">our time back through being digital</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.909" end="00:02:22.220" style="s2">nomads so read a lot more books had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.010" end="00:02:23.630" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.220" end="00:02:25.730" style="s2">or those conversations then decided to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.630" end="00:02:26.630" style="s2">start recording them did you guys do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.730" end="00:02:28.700" style="s2">guys have like a background in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.630" end="00:02:30.470" style="s2">philosophy or anything you study at</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.700" end="00:02:33.620" style="s2">university but what brought you did that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.470" end="00:02:35.750" style="s2">specifically we both had actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.620" end="00:02:37.880" style="s2">a series of really challenging events</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.750" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">happening kind of in our late teens</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.880" end="00:02:43.730" style="s2">early 20s a lot of deaths around us a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:47.660" style="s2">lot of just really challenging things</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.730" end="00:02:49.880" style="s2">and for me I&#39;ll speak about myself it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.660" end="00:02:52.040" style="s2">kind of got me into meditation and and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.880" end="00:02:53.690" style="s2">started to you know realize the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.040" end="00:02:55.100" style="s2">fragility of life and got into a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.690" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">more philosophical subjects there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.100" end="00:02:58.220" style="s2">lot of the stuff I&#39;d been doing at that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">time was a lot more related to just</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.220" end="00:03:02.870" style="s2">music and music production I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:04.760" style="s2">to be a recording engineer and so I I</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.870" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">just felt like I wanted to have some</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.760" end="00:03:09.530" style="s2">kind of bigger impact than just</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.780" style="s2">recording metal bands and in a basement</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.530" end="00:03:13.970" style="s2">studio and I wanted to travel and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.780" end="00:03:19.340" style="s2">the world and that kind of stuff so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.970" end="00:03:22.160" style="s2">really started the adventure for me I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.340" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">grew up in during the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.160" end="00:03:27.830" style="s2">Soviet Union so I think just seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:30.019" style="s2">grit of the world and the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.830" end="00:03:32.120" style="s2">the world just shoved right in my face</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.019" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">from an early childhood made me question</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.120" end="00:03:36.890" style="s2">a lot of things made me question reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">question why you know people on TV were</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.890" end="00:03:42.019" style="s2">saying one thing but I was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">another thing in my everyday life and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.019" end="00:03:46.220" style="s2">I just I spent a lot of time alone I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.320" style="s2">kind of a loner as a kid and just spent</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.220" end="00:03:51.230" style="s2">a lot of time thinking about nature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.320" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">reality I didn&#39;t develop a formal</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.230" end="00:03:58.040" style="s2">meditation practice until later but that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">was also a big part of my path I studied</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.040" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">psychology and university and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.130" end="00:04:07.459" style="s2">trying to understand human nature and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:10.790" style="s2">had you know had a lot of challenges the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.459" end="00:04:12.140" style="s2">same as what Mike was saying and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.790" end="00:04:15.049" style="s2">think it was just a natural progression</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.140" end="00:04:16.940" style="s2">for both of us that we came to these</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.049" end="00:04:19.100" style="s2">subjects okay so you both have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:21.049" style="s2">background in kind of inner growth work</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.100" end="00:04:23.419" style="s2">of some kind meditation and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.049" end="00:04:26.090" style="s2">so what topics do you tend to cover on</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.419" end="00:04:28.310" style="s2">the show well it&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.090" end="00:04:30.650" style="s2">blending of our two interests like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.310" end="00:04:32.360" style="s2">lot more techie you know study</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.650" end="00:04:33.860" style="s2">programming engineering that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.360" end="00:04:34.910" style="s2">stuff so I really like that stuff I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.860" end="00:04:35.990" style="s2">really interested in artificial</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.910" end="00:04:38.870" style="s2">intelligence and blah</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.990" end="00:04:41.000" style="s2">Chane a lot of these technologies we</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.870" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">haven&#39;t really been covering that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.000" end="00:04:46.970" style="s2">lately it&#39;s been more about personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:48.410" style="s2">development psychology sociology we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.970" end="00:04:51.470" style="s2">really interested in the development of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.410" end="00:04:53.390" style="s2">society and so we&#39;ve been attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.470" end="00:04:55.760" style="s2">thinkers like you know Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.390" end="00:04:58.070" style="s2">Jordan green Hall Daniel Stockton Berger</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.760" end="00:05:02.360" style="s2">these guys who are trying to map out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.070" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">territory of the necessity of evolving</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.360" end="00:05:05.690" style="s2">society and so that&#39;s what our podcast</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:07.910" style="s2">is about the evolution of technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.690" end="00:05:09.140" style="s2">society and consciousness yeah yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.910" end="00:05:14.360" style="s2">love to come back to that in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.140" end="00:05:16.670" style="s2">about I think probably we&#39;ve all of us</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.360" end="00:05:18.710" style="s2">have a sense of that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.670" end="00:05:19.850" style="s2">direction to this conversation and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.710" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">we&#39;re following the thread of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.850" end="00:05:24.290" style="s2">conversation and where it&#39;s going the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">the kind of emergence of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.290" end="00:05:30.770" style="s2">was a real kind of exclamation point in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:32.480" style="s2">that and then and we&#39;ve also I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.770" end="00:05:34.040" style="s2">sense we&#39;ve also kind of honed in on</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.480" end="00:05:36.500" style="s2">some of the similar thinkers who we</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.040" end="00:05:37.790" style="s2">think have the really crucial pieces to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.500" end="00:05:39.380" style="s2">add to that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.790" end="00:05:42.530" style="s2">you mentioned Jordan Greenhalgh or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.380" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">Jordan Hall as as he now is Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.530" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">Shmack Tim Berger for example Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:50.780" style="s2">wheal those kind of thinkers who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:52.490" style="s2">probably not as well known yet as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.780" end="00:05:54.980" style="s2">sort of intellectual dark web thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.490" end="00:05:58.040" style="s2">but we all think have something really</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.980" end="00:06:00.920" style="s2">crucial to add to the conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.040" end="00:06:03.020" style="s2">just before we get into that we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.920" end="00:06:04.730" style="s2">a little bit about our background so Ali</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.020" end="00:06:06.580" style="s2">and I actually met through the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.730" end="00:06:09.580" style="s2">psychedelic festival breakin convention</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.580" end="00:06:12.650" style="s2">which is the biggest festival around</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.580" end="00:06:14.120" style="s2">psychedelic science in in the UK in</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.120" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what we say yeah I know it is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.830" end="00:06:23.620" style="s2">biggest in Europe yeah yeah and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">had a shared interest in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.620" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">psychedelics personal growth and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:33.250" style="s2">transformation and personally I trained</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">as a journalist I&#39;ve worked for about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.250" end="00:06:40.370" style="s2">probably 12 to 15 years as a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:42.170" style="s2">at the BBC and then at channel 4 and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.370" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">then started making documentaries for</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.170" end="00:06:46.280" style="s2">the BBC in channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:48.530" style="s2">so working inside a newsroom as well for</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.280" end="00:06:49.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who work make</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.530" end="00:06:51.410" style="s2">documentaries</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.550" end="00:06:54.979" style="s2">I think that experience of being inside</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.410" end="00:06:58.340" style="s2">a newsroom and being like immersed in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.979" end="00:07:02.449" style="s2">the in the conversation for over 10</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.340" end="00:07:05.150" style="s2">years is something that that is is quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.449" end="00:07:06.770" style="s2">a unique obviously it&#39;s not unique lots</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.150" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">of other people do it but but it gives</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.770" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">you a different sense of kind of the ebb</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:16.250" style="s2">and flow of the of the the news agenda</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">and just getting very frustrated and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.250" end="00:07:23.569" style="s2">very bored with the whole thing like how</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:25.610" style="s2">facile so much of the conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.569" end="00:07:27.349" style="s2">and how difficult it is to break out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.610" end="00:07:31.099" style="s2">certain ways of looking at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.349" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">how much is excluded from those the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.099" end="00:07:39.530" style="s2">everyday perspectives and and what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:42.889" style="s2">what I really I&#39;m hoping for from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.530" end="00:07:44.900" style="s2">the video side of rebel wisdom is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.889" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">we&#39;re bringing a slightly deeper lens on</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.900" end="00:07:49.550" style="s2">some of those questions and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:53.449" style="s2">interested to see where that goes in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.550" end="00:07:56.110" style="s2">future what are what would a education</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.449" end="00:07:59.449" style="s2">policy or a health a health policy</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.110" end="00:08:00.949" style="s2">influenced by a much deeper sense of who</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.449" end="00:08:05.139" style="s2">we are as people rather than this sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.949" end="00:08:09.229" style="s2">of materialist paradigm or this very</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.139" end="00:08:11.889" style="s2">transactional game a if people know that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.229" end="00:08:15.110" style="s2">kind of terminology the terminology that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.889" end="00:08:18.349" style="s2">Brett weinstein Jordan Green Hall often</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.110" end="00:08:19.729" style="s2">often use and that&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.349" end="00:08:23.000" style="s2">think is really interesting that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.729" end="00:08:25.009" style="s2">I sort of see going forward is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.000" end="00:08:28.759" style="s2">interesting area to look at if we took</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.009" end="00:08:30.469" style="s2">it talking about systems change or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.759" end="00:08:33.800" style="s2">end of one paradigm what does this new</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.469" end="00:08:36.829" style="s2">paradigm look like and then just to sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.800" end="00:08:39.169" style="s2">of round that off that has to go into</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.829" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">the transformational that has to go into</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.169" end="00:08:44.680" style="s2">the liminal that has to go into the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">areas of what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.680" end="00:08:50.540" style="s2">spirituality or personal growth or and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:52.100" style="s2">there&#39;s also not really a good language</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.540" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">for it because all of those words are</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.100" end="00:08:55.250" style="s2">contaminate to one degree or another so</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:57.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do you have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.250" end="00:08:59.290" style="s2">conversation while all the terminology</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.470" end="00:09:02.790" style="s2">that you might use to talk about it as</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:04.290" style="s2">associations that you that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.790" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">block so many people from hearing what</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.290" end="00:09:10.170" style="s2">you have to say so yeah that&#39;s why rebel</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:12.540" style="s2">wisdom with rebel wisdom we run events</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.170" end="00:09:14.070" style="s2">we run live</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.540" end="00:09:15.780" style="s2">we run live events and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.070" end="00:09:18.630" style="s2">transformational workshops to try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.780" end="00:09:21.840" style="s2">bring all of those pieces together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.630" end="00:09:23.520" style="s2">my background is maybe not so different</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.840" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">to yours Mike in the sense I started</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.520" end="00:09:30.450" style="s2">meditating quite early on in my life so</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:33.240" style="s2">I think I was maybe 18 19 and I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.450" end="00:09:35.250" style="s2">really I guess has been to threads my</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.240" end="00:09:36.840" style="s2">own personal development I was one with</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.250" end="00:09:38.370" style="s2">psychedelics which is the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.840" end="00:09:40.590" style="s2">actually started meditating his paws I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.370" end="00:09:44.190" style="s2">was fascinated by that experience and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.590" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">fascinated by really what what what had</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.190" end="00:09:49.770" style="s2">opened up and so got quite into</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">meditation and then was fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.770" end="00:09:54.210" style="s2">just the whole philosophy around the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">psychedelic world so I see I used to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.210" end="00:09:59.070" style="s2">spend lots and lots of times in forums</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:02.730" style="s2">arguing about free will versus</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.070" end="00:10:05.430" style="s2">determinism and any any kind of subject</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.730" end="00:10:09.180" style="s2">and that really felt like the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.430" end="00:10:11.520" style="s2">edge of the conversation to me maybe 15</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.180" end="00:10:14.520" style="s2">years ago even to this day I have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.520" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">feeling that a lot of what was coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.520" end="00:10:20.460" style="s2">out of the psychedelic community 20 from</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">you 20 years ago onwards was still very</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.460" end="00:10:23.310" style="s2">relevant and maybe quite far ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">its time I see a lot of the same ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.310" end="00:10:29.310" style="s2">popping up so I got involved in well I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:32.700" style="s2">started with my wife a meditation school</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.310" end="00:10:34.380" style="s2">in London and also I&#39;m one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.700" end="00:10:36.330" style="s2">organizers of breaking convention this</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.380" end="00:10:38.970" style="s2">psychedelic conference David mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.330" end="00:10:41.580" style="s2">earlier which is happening now again in</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.970" end="00:10:44.280" style="s2">August so it&#39;s been really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.580" end="00:10:45.900" style="s2">to watch that strand grow I think over</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.280" end="00:10:47.820" style="s2">the years I kind of took a step back</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.900" end="00:10:50.990" style="s2">from the psychedelic world because I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.820" end="00:10:53.280" style="s2">feel any community gets very insular and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.990" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">gets into a bubble and I didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.280" end="00:10:57.930" style="s2">like all of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:11:00.540" style="s2">conversations were happening there then</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.930" end="00:11:01.860" style="s2">as well as all of that I was also</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.540" end="00:11:03.540" style="s2">working kind of leading a double life</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.860" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">that was a very strange period where I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.540" end="00:11:08.520" style="s2">was running a meditation studio and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.440" style="s2">freelancing and working in advertising</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.520" end="00:11:13.830" style="s2">agencies and marketing agencies and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.440" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">having a foot very much in both worlds</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.830" end="00:11:16.650" style="s2">in the world where you have to explain</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:20.100" style="s2">things very simply to people</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.650" end="00:11:22.410" style="s2">and the world of inner development where</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.100" end="00:11:24.650" style="s2">it&#39;s sometimes impossible to explain</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.410" end="00:11:27.000" style="s2">things at all so I&#39;ve always found that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.650" end="00:11:29.550" style="s2">intersection and that crux point really</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.000" end="00:11:32.190" style="s2">fascinating - I think Douglas Adams said</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.550" end="00:11:34.350" style="s2">2fd ineffable now how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.190" end="00:11:35.910" style="s2">translate what really is liminal and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.350" end="00:11:38.100" style="s2">can&#39;t be felt in a way that is useful</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.910" end="00:11:39.390" style="s2">for people and that people understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.100" end="00:11:43.380" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s always been a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.390" end="00:11:44.910" style="s2">fascination of mine and yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.380" end="00:11:46.410" style="s2">inner growth work which it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.910" end="00:11:49.370" style="s2">all of us share has been come</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.410" end="00:11:51.630" style="s2">increasingly important not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.370" end="00:11:54.120" style="s2">meditation but also group work and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.630" end="00:11:56.220" style="s2">practices like for example breath work</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.120" end="00:11:58.440" style="s2">or a lot of the embodied practices have</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.220" end="00:12:01.140" style="s2">become another piece of the puzzle so it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.440" end="00:12:02.910" style="s2">feels like much like covering this</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.140" end="00:12:04.680" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s always pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.910" end="00:12:08.040" style="s2">the puzzle that slot in and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.680" end="00:12:09.570" style="s2">a kind of growing emerging process both</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.040" end="00:12:10.950" style="s2">on the individual level and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.570" end="00:12:12.870" style="s2">collective level as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.950" end="00:12:15.240" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s fascinating to me is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.870" end="00:12:17.010" style="s2">layering of all of these different kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.240" end="00:12:19.500" style="s2">of disciplines and I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.010" end="00:12:22.440" style="s2">reference spiral dynamics quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:23.850" style="s2">because there are so many ways and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.440" end="00:12:26.700" style="s2">developmental levels to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.850" end="00:12:28.650" style="s2">world and they become your lens whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.700" end="00:12:30.180" style="s2">kind of level you&#39;re operating from and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.650" end="00:12:34.200" style="s2">you could look through shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.180" end="00:12:35.670" style="s2">Buddhism the IDW all different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.200" end="00:12:37.320" style="s2">kind of understanding the world but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.670" end="00:12:38.460" style="s2">really interested in the connection</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.320" end="00:12:41.520" style="s2">points between all of them the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.460" end="00:12:44.220" style="s2">similarities and overlap it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.520" end="00:12:46.620" style="s2">really interesting bringing integral</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.220" end="00:12:50.280" style="s2">into the conversation with the the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.620" end="00:12:52.400" style="s2">because obviously we have interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.280" end="00:12:55.550" style="s2">quite a few of the IDW figures and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.400" end="00:12:57.780" style="s2">talked about the IDW as an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.550" end="00:13:00.630" style="s2">integral conversation in a piece that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.780" end="00:13:03.960" style="s2">Ken Wilber read and then got in touch to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.630" end="00:13:05.310" style="s2">say I&#39;d love to speak to you about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.960" end="00:13:08.850" style="s2">and then we did the interviews with him</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.310" end="00:13:11.610" style="s2">and that I think Jamie will put it well</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.850" end="00:13:13.740" style="s2">and that a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.610" end="00:13:17.370" style="s2">currently breaking trail are running an</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.740" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">integral OS it&#39;s a very good operating</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.370" end="00:13:21.930" style="s2">system I think the danger with it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:23.370" style="s2">that it&#39;s easy to get caught in that if</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.930" end="00:13:25.470" style="s2">you get caught in that operating system</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.370" end="00:13:26.700" style="s2">then suddenly you&#39;re only communicating</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.470" end="00:13:30.450" style="s2">with other people who are inside that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.700" end="00:13:32.700" style="s2">system and you get lost in the map which</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.450" end="00:13:34.170" style="s2">ironically integral talks about how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.700" end="00:13:36.990" style="s2">must never get lost in the map and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.170" end="00:13:41.340" style="s2">promptly often gets lost in the map but</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.990" end="00:13:45.090" style="s2">there is this there is a sense for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.340" end="00:13:48.990" style="s2">certainly that the this IDW</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.090" end="00:13:51.510" style="s2">constellation really needs that map like</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.990" end="00:13:53.670" style="s2">peterson obviously he talked a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.510" end="00:13:55.470" style="s2">jean piaget and jean piaget was one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.670" end="00:13:59.130" style="s2">the originators of a whole of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.470" end="00:14:00.870" style="s2">developmental model but I really think I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.130" end="00:14:02.490" style="s2">just look at some of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.870" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">that are being had for example the Sam</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.490" end="00:14:06.980" style="s2">Harris Jordan Peterson debates about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:09.390" style="s2">nature of truth and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.980" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">religious truth it&#39;s like are there in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.390" end="00:14:13.620" style="s2">different quadrants just talking past</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">each other and a little bit of integral</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.620" end="00:14:17.580" style="s2">theory would have really helped them</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:19.980" style="s2">navigate that conversation you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.580" end="00:14:22.890" style="s2">had this sense of them just talking past</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.980" end="00:14:26.670" style="s2">each other infuriating Lee for hours on</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.890" end="00:14:29.250" style="s2">end yeah this is so true I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.670" end="00:14:32.130" style="s2">really interesting how something is</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.250" end="00:14:33.870" style="s2">emerging right now where people are</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.130" end="00:14:36.270" style="s2">starting to understand that a single</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.870" end="00:14:39.060" style="s2">point of view is insufficient to view</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.270" end="00:14:42.660" style="s2">the world and we need some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.060" end="00:14:45.420" style="s2">collective consciousness or a way to for</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.660" end="00:14:48.780" style="s2">multiple people to contribute pieces to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.420" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">create a more whole picture of what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.780" end="00:14:52.830" style="s2">going on and I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:54.630" style="s2">intellectual dark web has kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.830" end="00:14:56.700" style="s2">started on that path where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.630" end="00:14:58.860" style="s2">trying to integrate different points of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.700" end="00:15:01.170" style="s2">view but then they stalled a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.860" end="00:15:02.730" style="s2">because maybe people got too famous or</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.170" end="00:15:04.170" style="s2">you know they&#39;re getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.730" end="00:15:06.270" style="s2">reinforcement for this kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.170" end="00:15:07.980" style="s2">polarized or political stuff and they a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.270" end="00:15:09.870" style="s2">little bit got away from the sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.980" end="00:15:11.490" style="s2">making conversation and there are other</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.870" end="00:15:13.830" style="s2">thinkers that are now becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.490" end="00:15:16.050" style="s2">prominent who are picking up that trail</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.830" end="00:15:18.210" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the crux I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.050" end="00:15:20.100" style="s2">the crux of what&#39;s going on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.210" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something we&#39;ve talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.100" end="00:15:24.810" style="s2">lot and I&#39;ve been wrestling with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:27.110" style="s2">documentary for quite a while glittering</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.810" end="00:15:33.000" style="s2">the matrix 3 which is about exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.110" end="00:15:34.680" style="s2">I think the issue is partly that people</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.000" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">in the IDW some of them were very</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.680" end="00:15:38.640" style="s2">attached to certain perspectives if</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2">you&#39;ve built a career on a certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.640" end="00:15:42.329" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s very hard then to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.350" end="00:15:43.559" style="s2">unpick that and say the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.329" end="00:15:45.299" style="s2">with this there is a sense at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.559" end="00:15:47.489" style="s2">beginning especially the way it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.299" end="00:15:50.009" style="s2">originally framed as if you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.489" end="00:15:52.949" style="s2">better idea I&#39;m happy to change my mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.009" end="00:15:54.869" style="s2">this can be an evolving conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.949" end="00:15:57.059" style="s2">I think it&#39;s fair to say that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.869" end="00:15:59.519" style="s2">really been borne out I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.059" end="00:16:02.129" style="s2">have a sense of real novelty coming from</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.519" end="00:16:04.649" style="s2">that constellation for quite a while now</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.129" end="00:16:07.769" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.649" end="00:16:09.509" style="s2">interesting to compare the the IDW to</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.769" end="00:16:12.629" style="s2">the thinkers we kind of touched on</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.509" end="00:16:14.339" style="s2">earlier we&#39;ve all had in channel you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.629" end="00:16:16.799" style="s2">know Daniel schmuck Tim Berger Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.339" end="00:16:19.470" style="s2">Hall John reveille key who have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.799" end="00:16:23.220" style="s2">attitudinal difference then many of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.470" end="00:16:24.299" style="s2">IDW figures do now at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.220" end="00:16:27.029" style="s2">maybe it wasn&#39;t true at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.299" end="00:16:29.639" style="s2">but the idea of being okay with not</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.029" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">knowing the idea of the liminal or all</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.639" end="00:16:34.529" style="s2">of that is is so simple and yet so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">hugely important for the way the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.529" end="00:16:39.059" style="s2">conversation moves and and so much of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:40.499" style="s2">also maps on to what we know from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.059" end="00:16:42.779" style="s2">meditative with the contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.499" end="00:16:44.790" style="s2">traditions you know knowing how not to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.779" end="00:16:46.829" style="s2">become attached knowing the dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.790" end="00:16:48.689" style="s2">the phenomenology of attachment all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.829" end="00:16:50.429" style="s2">these things from the upper left</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.689" end="00:16:53.549" style="s2">quadrant let&#39;s say from the inner world</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.429" end="00:16:55.350" style="s2">they are very important to translate</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.549" end="00:16:56.999" style="s2">into the way we communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.350" end="00:17:00.629" style="s2">other and it&#39;s it&#39;s complex but I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.999" end="00:17:02.610" style="s2">hugely hugely important yeah I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.629" end="00:17:05.010" style="s2">very curious of where the influences</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.610" end="00:17:08.010" style="s2">have come from is if we want to use</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.010" end="00:17:09.569" style="s2">Jordan Peterson as an example like to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.010" end="00:17:11.189" style="s2">it felt like at the beginning my</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.569" end="00:17:13.769" style="s2">interpretation of him was that he was</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.189" end="00:17:17.730" style="s2">trying to be a demonstration of how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.769" end="00:17:19.799" style="s2">debate properly and it seems now that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.730" end="00:17:21.750" style="s2">when you look at the YouTube headlines</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.799" end="00:17:24.360" style="s2">anything to do with Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.750" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">generally Jordan Peterson destroys so</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.360" end="00:17:30.630" style="s2">and so right and so and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:32.519" style="s2">fame component with him as well that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.630" end="00:17:34.740" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of blasted in the stratosphere</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.519" end="00:17:37.590" style="s2">of Fame and so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.740" end="00:17:39.899" style="s2">the controversy that has pushed him that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.590" end="00:17:41.820" style="s2">high that is now maybe causing him to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.899" end="00:17:44.190" style="s2">perpetuate some sort of controversy like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.820" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s generally nothing kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.190" end="00:17:49.769" style="s2">of easy about what he says it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:51.299" style="s2">like finger pointy kind of like you need</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.769" end="00:17:53.340" style="s2">to do this you&#39;re doing this wrong that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.299" end="00:17:55.400" style="s2">kind of thing so it&#39;s very hard for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.340" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.400" end="00:18:02.159" style="s2">separate him from this movement in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:04.620" style="s2">way that this this movement seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.159" end="00:18:07.070" style="s2">co-opted by this sort of clickbait II</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.620" end="00:18:09.480" style="s2">kind of headline-grabbing</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.070" end="00:18:11.429" style="s2">attention-grabbing oppositional exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.480" end="00:18:13.340" style="s2">so when we spoke to John Vevey key he</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.429" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">said that he thought it was a mistake to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.340" end="00:18:18.210" style="s2">to go down to the political level so</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.280" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.210" end="00:18:22.830" style="s2">and how Jordan Peterson success is</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.280" end="00:18:26.490" style="s2">directly related to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.830" end="00:18:27.960" style="s2">but he he personally would was much less</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.490" end="00:18:29.580" style="s2">comfortable with making political</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.960" end="00:18:32.210" style="s2">statements and bring it down into</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.580" end="00:18:36.270" style="s2">political realm but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.210" end="00:18:38.130" style="s2">Jordan Pederson has a lot of his success</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.270" end="00:18:39.690" style="s2">and a lot of his fame has been that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.130" end="00:18:42.630" style="s2">willing to have those conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.690" end="00:18:44.429" style="s2">he&#39;s also when he&#39;s good at it he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.630" end="00:18:46.559" style="s2">good at it the the Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.429" end="00:18:50.100" style="s2">interview for example I think was a real</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.559" end="00:18:55.470" style="s2">case in point it was he kept his cool he</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.100" end="00:19:01.830" style="s2">seemed very it really showed up a sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.470" end="00:19:03.900" style="s2">of a kind of simulated thinking in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.830" end="00:19:05.340" style="s2">media really really well because it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.900" end="00:19:06.690" style="s2">like she was running a program and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.340" end="00:19:09.840" style="s2">was like but there was an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">for a dialogue and that I thought could</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.840" end="00:19:13.470" style="s2">have been had and I&#39;d loved to have seen</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.870" style="s2">him and Kathy for example have another</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.470" end="00:19:17.700" style="s2">conversation I was actually can I work</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.870" end="00:19:19.380" style="s2">with Kathy and I also had done the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.700" end="00:19:22.200" style="s2">documentary about Jordan I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.380" end="00:19:23.850" style="s2">behind the scenes to get them to be able</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.200" end="00:19:26.190" style="s2">to talk to each other but it was already</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.850" end="00:19:27.809" style="s2">there was a lack of trust there and</p>

<p begin="00:19:29.250" end="00:19:36.690" style="s2">there Jordan did and I see so many of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.330" end="00:19:39.809" style="s2">the and then I I have a sense since then</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.690" end="00:19:42.510" style="s2">that he is and he&#39;s actually talked</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.809" end="00:19:45.419" style="s2">about this himself in one of his Q&amp;A s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.510" end="00:19:48.900" style="s2">that he&#39;s felt a little bit of battle</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.419" end="00:19:50.549" style="s2">weariness and defensiveness coming up</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.900" end="00:19:52.980" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s probably true with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.549" end="00:19:55.620" style="s2">lot of the other people in the IDW that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.980" end="00:19:57.780" style="s2">sam harris as well and eric Weinstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.620" end="00:20:00.750" style="s2">also said that so many of the critiques</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.780" end="00:20:05.340" style="s2">were low-quality that they&#39;ve started to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.750" end="00:20:07.890" style="s2">actually become immune and and death to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.340" end="00:20:08.620" style="s2">some of the better critiques and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.890" end="00:20:10.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.620" end="00:20:12.279" style="s2">it must be almost impossible if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.600" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">at that level of Fame and you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.279" end="00:20:16.630" style="s2">so much critique and so much of it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:18.549" style="s2">actually poor to then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.630" end="00:20:20.919" style="s2">differentiate okay what&#39;s the good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.549" end="00:20:23.590" style="s2">from the bad stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.919" end="00:20:26.350" style="s2">I&#39;m really curious of your guys&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.590" end="00:20:29.740" style="s2">perspective on the kind of shift in</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.350" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">conversation in the IDW and namely I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.740" end="00:20:35.230" style="s2">think I heard this term from you guys</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:37.659" style="s2">first the intellectual deep web why&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.230" end="00:20:39.490" style="s2">there a necessity to switch or what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.659" end="00:20:42.039" style="s2">what&#39;s with the new label I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.490" end="00:20:44.950" style="s2">understand it how he came up with it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.039" end="00:20:48.399" style="s2">what&#39;s with it yeah it&#39;s well I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.950" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">the the initial impulse was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.399" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about now is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:55.149" style="s2">okay well there&#39;s a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:56.860" style="s2">firstly I don&#39;t think the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.149" end="00:20:59.020" style="s2">that needs to be had and the movement</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.860" end="00:21:01.390" style="s2">that we need to make as individuals or</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.020" end="00:21:03.970" style="s2">collectively is going to be solved from</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.390" end="00:21:06.039" style="s2">the intellectual level alone I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.970" end="00:21:07.330" style="s2">intellectual level is very important but</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.039" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">if something gets stuck in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.330" end="00:21:12.820" style="s2">intellectual it just goes round and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:14.350" style="s2">round and you need something I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.820" end="00:21:17.020" style="s2">know this even from research into</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.350" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">creativity you know Annie McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.020" end="00:21:20.200" style="s2">who you&#39;ve had on the channel a few</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">times has got a great take on this with</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.200" end="00:21:23.770" style="s2">the left brain and the right brain as</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:25.419" style="s2">well the right hemisphere being largely</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.770" end="00:21:27.309" style="s2">responsible for what we don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.419" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">if we&#39;re if we&#39;re not tapping into that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.309" end="00:21:34.510" style="s2">and we can get just kind of shut down</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:37.179" style="s2">into reality tunnels so the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.510" end="00:21:39.130" style="s2">I mean to be fair the word intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.179" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">should be out of the entire equation I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.130" end="00:21:42.850" style="s2">think rather than just intellectual deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:45.220" style="s2">web is just a little bit more punchy but</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.850" end="00:21:47.320" style="s2">that that there needs to be again an</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.220" end="00:21:49.000" style="s2">integral view on it there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.320" end="00:21:51.610" style="s2">intellect and then there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.000" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">that goes beyond the intellect and both</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.610" end="00:21:57.580" style="s2">of those need to be in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:59.490" style="s2">and rarely do I see that in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.580" end="00:22:04.390" style="s2">intellectual dark web certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.490" end="00:22:05.830" style="s2">recently at all really and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.390" end="00:22:08.110" style="s2">missing piece I think and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.830" end="00:22:09.730" style="s2">piece that I think we&#39;re always on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.110" end="00:22:12.779" style="s2">lookout for and I think you guys to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.730" end="00:22:14.649" style="s2">is is who&#39;s holding who&#39;s holding that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.779" end="00:22:16.299" style="s2">perspective that can contain many</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.649" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">perspectives and that can say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.299" end="00:22:22.210" style="s2">know and that can let go and flow and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:22.540" style="s2">also that there is so I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.210" end="00:22:25.090" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.540" end="00:22:26.830" style="s2">to think about who who it would be in an</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.090" end="00:22:29.110" style="s2">intellectual deep web that wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.830" end="00:22:31.930" style="s2">in an intellectual dark web because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.110" end="00:22:35.380" style="s2">think for me the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.930" end="00:22:37.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very if it&#39;s got Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.380" end="00:22:40.690" style="s2">Peterson in it certainly goes beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.660" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">purely materialist but there is still</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.690" end="00:22:50.380" style="s2">quite a kind of materialist bias to it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:52.540" style="s2">think and I I think that the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.380" end="00:22:54.670" style="s2">thinkers that need to be integrated into</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.540" end="00:22:57.460" style="s2">any sort of if what we&#39;re moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.670" end="00:23:00.370" style="s2">is a genuine synthesis then I think we</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.460" end="00:23:02.530" style="s2">need people like Stan Grof for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.370" end="00:23:04.540" style="s2">who was doing some incredible depth</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.530" end="00:23:08.260" style="s2">psychology with psychedelics back in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.540" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">50s and 60s came up with with some kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.260" end="00:23:12.760" style="s2">of incredible models for personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:15.220" style="s2">transformation and you&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.760" end="00:23:18.460" style="s2">like Richard tarnis who I think are some</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.220" end="00:23:20.980" style="s2">of the an incredible thing put produced</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.460" end="00:23:23.440" style="s2">something called passion of the Western</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.980" end="00:23:25.290" style="s2">mind and then cosmos and psyche who are</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.440" end="00:23:29.500" style="s2">the people who are just a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.290" end="00:23:30.970" style="s2">esoteric for a evolutionary an</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.500" end="00:23:33.930" style="s2">evolutionary biologist like Brett</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.970" end="00:23:37.900" style="s2">Weinstein or maths and physicists like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.930" end="00:23:39.340" style="s2">Eric - like who&#39;s a little bit too hot</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.900" end="00:23:41.140" style="s2">to handle for someone who&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.340" end="00:23:45.460" style="s2">concerned about their standing in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.140" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">Academy and and who had who is holding</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.460" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">those extra pieces</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:51.310" style="s2">I&#39;d say it&#39;s also the kind of esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">tradition of people at Rudolf Steiner</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.310" end="00:23:56.920" style="s2">it&#39;s Carl Jung who thanks to Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:59.350" style="s2">now becoming part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.920" end="00:24:01.390" style="s2">again but but even he was warned not to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.350" end="00:24:03.430" style="s2">go anywhere near Carl Jung while he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.390" end="00:24:05.620" style="s2">at when he was at uni it was like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.430" end="00:24:08.680" style="s2">is this is intellectually toxic to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.620" end="00:24:13.420" style="s2">anywhere near him Freud just about that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.680" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">no Jung is it&#39;s too far away is too too</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.420" end="00:24:17.710" style="s2">esoteric now thankfully Jung seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:20.500" style="s2">coming back in a really big way and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:23.050" style="s2">think he&#39;s a absolutely crucial thinker</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.500" end="00:24:24.930" style="s2">but then you&#39;ve got Stan Grof who goes</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.050" end="00:24:27.310" style="s2">even further than Jung in in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.930" end="00:24:28.990" style="s2">so it&#39;s like who are those people</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.310" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">because I think there are if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.990" end="00:24:33.190" style="s2">history as a kind of a river and a set</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">of eddies who are the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.190" end="00:24:36.280" style="s2">Eddy&#39;s to the side of that main</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.170" style="s2">intellectual current</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.280" end="00:24:40.330" style="s2">that are holding really really important</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.170" end="00:24:41.620" style="s2">pieces and I think some of those names</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.330" end="00:24:43.240" style="s2">that I&#39;ve given it are some of them and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.620" end="00:24:44.890" style="s2">I&#39;m sure we can come up with more if if</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.240" end="00:24:48.340" style="s2">we wanted to and that for me is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.890" end="00:24:49.780" style="s2">depth the depth piece and also that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.340" end="00:24:51.940" style="s2">there&#39;s something about dark light</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.780" end="00:24:53.590" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an implicit there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.940" end="00:24:56.440" style="s2">implicit binary and the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.590" end="00:24:58.390" style="s2">dark web that I think isn&#39;t so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.440" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">there with the deep web there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.390" end="00:25:02.440" style="s2">not really a binary with depth and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.690" style="s2">shallowness in the same way as there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.440" end="00:25:06.820" style="s2">with dark and light so I think we need</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.690" end="00:25:11.110" style="s2">to get out of the binary you need to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.820" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">out of the sort of polarization and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.110" end="00:25:14.800" style="s2">depth maybe the way to get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:17.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a question for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.800" end="00:25:20.290" style="s2">actually on this note a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.410" end="00:25:22.300" style="s2">thinkers that we talk about or speak to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.290" end="00:25:24.190" style="s2">are thinkers you know they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.300" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">medium let&#39;s say is ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.190" end="00:25:29.560" style="s2">communicating those ideas usually with</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:32.950" style="s2">language there&#39;s I&#39;m very I&#39;m often</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.560" end="00:25:34.900" style="s2">wondering where are the artists and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.950" end="00:25:36.550" style="s2">storytellers and they&#39;re really you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.900" end="00:25:38.730" style="s2">maybe it maybe there&#39;s a sculptor who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.550" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">going to have some incredible</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.730" end="00:25:42.900" style="s2">explanation of the meaning crisis for</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:45.130" style="s2">example have you guys ever thought about</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.900" end="00:25:46.810" style="s2">these people these figures have you had</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.130" end="00:25:48.970" style="s2">any who have you had on who you would</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.810" end="00:25:51.730" style="s2">classes kind of maybe a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:53.380" style="s2">out there I would one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.730" end="00:25:55.060" style="s2">Benzes tool I would love to have main or</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.380" end="00:25:57.060" style="s2">discuss these subjects he&#39;s written so</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.060" end="00:26:00.160" style="s2">much about Carl Jung in the past</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.060" end="00:26:02.380" style="s2">transcendence DMT experiences he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.160" end="00:26:05.050" style="s2">brilliant thinker he&#39;s boring as hell to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.380" end="00:26:06.670" style="s2">interview but yeah I I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.050" end="00:26:09.090" style="s2">really onto something and actually as</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.670" end="00:26:12.700" style="s2">you were talking about this I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.090" end="00:26:15.330" style="s2">thinking that it&#39;s exactly that what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.700" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">said it&#39;s not thinkers it&#39;s more the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.330" end="00:26:20.410" style="s2">practitioners who are going to become</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.740" end="00:26:22.900" style="s2">important and we&#39;ve noticed this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.410" end="00:26:24.700" style="s2">actually in our courses that people want</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.900" end="00:26:26.200" style="s2">to gain some sort of information some</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.700" end="00:26:28.230" style="s2">sort of knowledge your framework but</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.200" end="00:26:30.460" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually want to apply it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.230" end="00:26:31.930" style="s2">this is a big problem with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.460" end="00:26:34.510" style="s2">people who hang out and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.930" end="00:26:36.490" style="s2">intellectual in the intellectual space</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.510" end="00:26:38.800" style="s2">that they&#39;re uncomfortable leaving it</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.490" end="00:26:40.680" style="s2">and the kinds of people that I think we</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.800" end="00:26:44.260" style="s2">desperately need in this new</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.680" end="00:26:46.570" style="s2">conversation are the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.260" end="00:26:49.960" style="s2">comfortable in or at least have</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.570" end="00:26:52.990" style="s2">experienced the no mind no self</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.960" end="00:26:55.720" style="s2">liminal space yeah it&#39;s a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.990" end="00:26:57.100" style="s2">this space that a lot of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.720" end="00:26:58.450" style="s2">actually they can only be described</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.100" end="00:27:00.730" style="s2">through language but you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.450" end="00:27:03.610" style="s2">like how do you describe a DMT trip in</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.730" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">language it&#39;s just like it fails we try</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.610" end="00:27:07.419" style="s2">it we did a whole series on DMT UV and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:09.909" style="s2">took turns and then we would document</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.419" end="00:27:11.169" style="s2">the experience and both of us would just</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.909" end="00:27:13.330" style="s2">come out of the trip laughing because</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.169" end="00:27:15.369" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible to describe it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.330" end="00:27:16.690" style="s2">you know I was like okay I know I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.369" end="00:27:18.279" style="s2">to describe this now and then all I</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.690" end="00:27:20.019" style="s2">could do is laugh at least you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.279" end="00:27:21.639" style="s2">story for when you go and Joe Rogan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.019" end="00:27:25.419" style="s2">podcast and he asked you the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.639" end="00:27:27.369" style="s2">question yeah he does a brilliant job of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.419" end="00:27:32.740" style="s2">explaining it I don&#39;t know how he puts</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.369" end="00:27:38.350" style="s2">words to it practice that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.740" end="00:27:40.419" style="s2">think there&#39;s a huge vacuum a a need for</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.350" end="00:27:42.190" style="s2">artists to come into this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.419" end="00:27:44.200" style="s2">and I just don&#39;t see it being filled at</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.190" end="00:27:46.659" style="s2">all like I would love to see more</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.200" end="00:27:48.429" style="s2">graffiti and more music and and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.659" end="00:27:50.889" style="s2">kinds of different digital arts being</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.429" end="00:27:52.659" style="s2">done and that&#39;s something I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.889" end="00:27:54.190" style="s2">tried to do with our podcast like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.659" end="00:27:55.720" style="s2">create a lot of the artwork for the pre</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.190" end="00:27:58.210" style="s2">for the podcast before we switch to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.720" end="00:28:01.240" style="s2">video and it was just an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.210" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">visualize the subjects right but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.240" end="00:28:05.409" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know why there&#39;s not more</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">out there that&#39;s kind of more popular</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.409" end="00:28:10.899" style="s2">than it is well I think it&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:12.669" style="s2">point that some people are just good at</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.899" end="00:28:16.659" style="s2">practice but they&#39;re not good at putting</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.669" end="00:28:19.059" style="s2">into words and vice versa and even in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.659" end="00:28:21.249" style="s2">saying that I see a huge need for</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.059" end="00:28:24.309" style="s2">bridging it&#39;s like we need better</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.249" end="00:28:26.909" style="s2">integration again in integral terms we</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.309" end="00:28:31.119" style="s2">need to integrate all the different</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.909" end="00:28:33.879" style="s2">faculties of the human experience that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.119" end="00:28:36.220" style="s2">have become so separated for different</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.879" end="00:28:37.629" style="s2">cultural reasons yes there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.220" end="00:28:40.539" style="s2">band that I&#39;m really into at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.629" end="00:28:42.600" style="s2">called comet is coming and I might even</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.539" end="00:28:46.570" style="s2">post the link to the review of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.600" end="00:28:49.210" style="s2">their latest album and it&#39;s the music is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.570" end="00:28:50.950" style="s2">the same story like what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.210" end="00:28:53.980" style="s2">through their music is exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:55.960" style="s2">story as I&#39;m hearing through the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.980" end="00:28:58.119" style="s2">guys on the cutting edge the Daniel SHM</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.960" end="00:29:01.330" style="s2">Acton Berger is the Jamie wheel I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.119" end="00:29:03.960" style="s2">the review said something like dancing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.330" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">in a it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.960" end="00:29:10.710" style="s2">like hopeful hopefully apocalyptic music</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:14.090" style="s2">in some sense that what they&#39;re and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.710" end="00:29:16.230" style="s2">I hear in the music and why I&#39;m sorry so</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.090" end="00:29:19.920" style="s2">enthused by it is this sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.230" end="00:29:23.730" style="s2">liveness of possibility with this sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.920" end="00:29:27.090" style="s2">of still sense of the overwhelm of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.730" end="00:29:29.370" style="s2">of the the moment at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.090" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">so I do think there are there are people</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.370" end="00:29:34.410" style="s2">communicating very similar things in</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:36.810" style="s2">different mediums but possibly and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.410" end="00:29:39.780" style="s2">love to talk to the the saxophonist</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.810" end="00:29:41.970" style="s2">about it and I I strongly suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.780" end="00:29:44.300" style="s2">that he would be trying to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.970" end="00:29:46.710" style="s2">through his music exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.300" end="00:29:48.630" style="s2">experiences probably through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.710" end="00:29:49.860" style="s2">the same substances as some of the some</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.630" end="00:29:55.050" style="s2">of the guys that we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.860" end="00:29:57.180" style="s2">have have also experienced and so it it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.050" end="00:29:59.070" style="s2">is a case of bridging though building</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.180" end="00:30:01.020" style="s2">those bridges as you said UV how do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.070" end="00:30:02.970" style="s2">build those bridges what is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.020" end="00:30:06.360" style="s2">soundtrack to the kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.970" end="00:30:09.540" style="s2">that we&#39;re having actually I just got</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.360" end="00:30:13.080" style="s2">reminded there&#39;s this short film that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.540" end="00:30:15.090" style="s2">really liked recently by Luba Mir our</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.080" end="00:30:20.160" style="s2">arse off yeah is that his last name</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.090" end="00:30:21.960" style="s2">called in shadow and it&#39;s it has a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.160" end="00:30:25.580" style="s2">trippy music soundtrack and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.960" end="00:30:29.910" style="s2">visuals it&#39;s a very beautiful kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.580" end="00:30:34.500" style="s2">dystopian demonstration of the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.910" end="00:30:37.590" style="s2">fakeness of current civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.500" end="00:30:40.800" style="s2">then at the end this hopeful twist that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.590" end="00:30:43.350" style="s2">is very I don&#39;t even know how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.800" end="00:30:45.330" style="s2">describe it it&#39;s esoteric it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.350" end="00:30:47.850" style="s2">sarcastically optimistic somehow I</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.330" end="00:30:52.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t find it to be sarcastic I found</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.850" end="00:30:54.420" style="s2">it to be very kind of mystical union of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.590" end="00:30:57.270" style="s2">the feminine and the masculine and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.420" end="00:31:00.630" style="s2">ascend and it&#39;s a very super archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.270" end="00:31:02.760" style="s2">so I thought that was really cool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.630" end="00:31:04.920" style="s2">interesting that we we had Erik Davis</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.760" end="00:31:08.730" style="s2">here yesterday you guys know Erik Davis</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.920" end="00:31:10.200" style="s2">the author he kind of he&#39;s written a few</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.730" end="00:31:13.320" style="s2">books that I keep row one called tech</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.200" end="00:31:16.110" style="s2">gnosis which is the intersection between</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.320" end="00:31:17.160" style="s2">technology psychedelics the esoteric a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.110" end="00:31:17.520" style="s2">really interesting guy but he had this</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.160" end="00:31:20.340" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.520" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">is that stuck with me he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.340" end="00:31:25.560" style="s2">live we&#39;re living in a banal apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:27.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m just cut it just popped up as</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.560" end="00:31:29.670" style="s2">everyone&#39;s talking because that is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.510" end="00:31:31.610" style="s2">common theme in the art that you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.670" end="00:31:34.950" style="s2">describing is there is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.610" end="00:31:38.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of banality and a sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.950" end="00:31:41.850" style="s2">of apocalyptic an apocalyptic situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.460" end="00:31:43.770" style="s2">and I&#39;m still trying to feel into that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.850" end="00:31:45.720" style="s2">the same question you had my cab while</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.770" end="00:31:48.270" style="s2">he goes like why aren&#39;t there lots of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.720" end="00:31:49.980" style="s2">artists putting out stuff was in every</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.270" end="00:31:53.190" style="s2">other historical period I can think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.980" end="00:31:54.630" style="s2">it was the the push against the culture</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.190" end="00:31:56.820" style="s2">were the thing that helped a new thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.630" end="00:31:59.040" style="s2">emerge was driven by the artists and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.820" end="00:32:00.450" style="s2">interestingly now it seems not to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.040" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">driven by the artists and in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.450" end="00:32:05.220" style="s2">seem to be absent not that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.510" style="s2">there at all but it&#39;s kind of hard to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.220" end="00:32:07.890" style="s2">find them you know we&#39;re talking right</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.510" end="00:32:09.570" style="s2">now we&#39;re kind of figure out that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.890" end="00:32:10.980" style="s2">there&#39;s this you know a few things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.570" end="00:32:13.020" style="s2">tapping into it so I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.980" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">that means we&#39;re headed for an explosion</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.020" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">of a new era of art or something else is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:21.750" style="s2">going on I hope so I mean one of the our</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:23.970" style="s2">favorite subjects to talk about is basic</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.750" end="00:32:25.680" style="s2">income which is and the reason before I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.970" end="00:32:29.430" style="s2">get into that that I love that subject</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.680" end="00:32:31.590" style="s2">so much is that I love art and I love</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.430" end="00:32:33.180" style="s2">seeing art without the commercial means</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.590" end="00:32:35.010" style="s2">and I think a lot of corporations are</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.180" end="00:32:36.210" style="s2">really good at co-opting art the second</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.010" end="00:32:38.280" style="s2">you put something really mind-blowing</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.210" end="00:32:40.500" style="s2">creative out there someone wants to hire</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.280" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">you to make their explainer video you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.500" end="00:32:44.310" style="s2">know so Luba Mir is a good I think a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:45.390" style="s2">good example of this I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.310" end="00:32:46.860" style="s2">he&#39;s doing now but he made this</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.390" end="00:32:48.330" style="s2">brilliant art piece and we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.860" end="00:32:51.080" style="s2">work with him and he&#39;s just booked up</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.330" end="00:32:53.520" style="s2">forever there&#39;s no way to get him so</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.080" end="00:32:57.300" style="s2">yeah I think something like a basic</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.520" end="00:32:59.400" style="s2">income even a small amount just to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.300" end="00:33:01.650" style="s2">expenses covered would be really</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.400" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">interesting to see the effects on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.650" end="00:33:05.330" style="s2">art explosion that would happen after</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:08.070" style="s2">that you know how many times do you ask</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.330" end="00:33:09.510" style="s2">people what they would do you probably</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.070" end="00:33:10.950" style="s2">asked this question at the retreats all</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.510" end="00:33:12.750" style="s2">the time what what would you do if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.950" end="00:33:14.850" style="s2">could do anything you want if my name is</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.750" end="00:33:16.140" style="s2">not an object exactly and how many</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.850" end="00:33:17.820" style="s2">answers do you get back that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.140" end="00:33:19.860" style="s2">arts or music or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.820" end="00:33:21.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like most of the time that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.860" end="00:33:23.820" style="s2">it is I&#39;d make documentaries that kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.780" end="00:33:25.620" style="s2">of thing so I would love to see what</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.820" end="00:33:27.810" style="s2">would happen with the basic income is as</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.620" end="00:33:30.450" style="s2">far as the art explosion goes take away</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.810" end="00:33:31.650" style="s2">the commercial incentive yeah I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.450" end="00:33:33.830" style="s2">to just raise something else</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.650" end="00:33:36.030" style="s2">just thinking about that bridge building</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.830" end="00:33:38.610" style="s2">that I was thinking maybe we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.030" end="00:33:40.110" style="s2">after the call but let&#39;s talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.610" end="00:33:42.290" style="s2">now and maybe it&#39;s something to be put</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.110" end="00:33:46.950" style="s2">out there as as a kind of open inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.290" end="00:33:48.870" style="s2">how do we turn this conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.950" end="00:33:51.330" style="s2">we&#39;re all aware of as a kind of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.870" end="00:33:53.040" style="s2">phenomenon and we we&#39;re all I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.330" end="00:33:54.780" style="s2">you&#39;re contacted by people in the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.040" end="00:33:57.570" style="s2">way that we are like constantly saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.780" end="00:33:59.340" style="s2">how can I get involved in this I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.570" end="00:34:00.990" style="s2">recognize what it is that you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.340" end="00:34:04.440" style="s2">doing I&#39;ve been following the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.990" end="00:34:09.149" style="s2">of threads how do we how do we turn this</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.440" end="00:34:10.860" style="s2">into a cultural movement how do we how</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.149" end="00:34:13.590" style="s2">do we make it into more than the sum of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.860" end="00:34:15.060" style="s2">its parts in a way that I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.590" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">know what that is I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.060" end="00:34:22.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a it starts with a kind of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:25.320" style="s2">in an email thread or a Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.590" end="00:34:26.970" style="s2">somewhere or something and and we think</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.320" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">about who are the other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.970" end="00:34:31.590" style="s2">part of this kind of emergent phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">and and try and pull our resources I I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.590" end="00:34:37.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it what it is but I do</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:38.790" style="s2">get the sense of that we I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.050" end="00:34:40.140" style="s2">certainly feel it myself very keenly</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.790" end="00:34:42.030" style="s2">with rebel wisdom it&#39;s like if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.140" end="00:34:44.909" style="s2">a catalyst for something bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.030" end="00:34:47.550" style="s2">ourselves then what are we doing this</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.909" end="00:34:51.510" style="s2">for because we don&#39;t have time either</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.550" end="00:34:54.630" style="s2">even if we were able to build a really</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.510" end="00:34:56.220" style="s2">kind of and we&#39;re barely sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.630" end="00:34:57.830" style="s2">sort of financially as it is but if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.220" end="00:35:00.270" style="s2">were able to create a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.830" end="00:35:01.800" style="s2">financially sustainable business and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.270" end="00:35:03.540" style="s2">we&#39;re doing really well I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.800" end="00:35:05.940" style="s2">that&#39;s enough I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.540" end="00:35:07.740" style="s2">enough for what needs to happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.940" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">near future and I think it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.740" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">some form of catalyzing something bigger</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:18.150" style="s2">than ourselves in that way and and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:21.840" style="s2">this game be world that we talk about as</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.150" end="00:35:24.300" style="s2">well that it&#39;s about it&#39;s a trans egoic</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.840" end="00:35:25.860" style="s2">space what does it look like to operate</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.300" end="00:35:27.360" style="s2">in this trans agarics pace who are the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.860" end="00:35:29.370" style="s2">other people that are operating in it as</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.360" end="00:35:31.260" style="s2">well and I mean really operating it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.370" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying that they are and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.260" end="00:35:34.920" style="s2">when it comes to any could have crunch</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:36.870" style="s2">decisions they go back to their kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.920" end="00:35:40.470" style="s2">ago--it programming how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.870" end="00:35:43.530" style="s2">beyond this and how how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.470" end="00:35:45.090" style="s2">scale or create more than how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.530" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">create a movement around</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.090" end="00:35:49.320" style="s2">that&#39;s my question that&#39;s why I open</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.560" end="00:35:51.510" style="s2">inquiry I think I have three kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.320" end="00:35:53.790" style="s2">answers to that the first is what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.510" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">attempted to do with our courses which</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.790" end="00:35:58.770" style="s2">is about kind of about the isolation</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:36:00.690" style="s2">that people you know who are writing</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.770" end="00:36:03.600" style="s2">those emails or asking they want a</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.690" end="00:36:04.980" style="s2">community to plug into but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.600" end="00:36:07.350" style="s2">of work that needs to be done just on</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.980" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">your own there&#39;s a lot of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.350" end="00:36:10.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of exploration there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">lot of deconstruction of my ego and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.920" end="00:36:15.480" style="s2">identity that I think is necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:17.220" style="s2">establish what I would probably term a</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.480" end="00:36:19.110" style="s2">collective intelligence like a global</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.220" end="00:36:21.090" style="s2">collective intelligence there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.110" end="00:36:23.100" style="s2">ways that a collective intelligence can</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.090" end="00:36:25.380" style="s2">screw up if someone you know is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.100" end="00:36:26.850" style="s2">signalling how smart they are or you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.380" end="00:36:28.740" style="s2">know wants to be the center of attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.850" end="00:36:31.260" style="s2">or is just kind of operating out of ego</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.740" end="00:36:32.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s that initial thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.260" end="00:36:34.950" style="s2">that people need to do before they</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.850" end="00:36:37.170" style="s2">should even attempt anything else do</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.950" end="00:36:39.150" style="s2">that in that self construction and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.170" end="00:36:42.210" style="s2">deconstruction work I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.150" end="00:36:45.350" style="s2">Peterson talks about quite a lot then</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.210" end="00:36:47.610" style="s2">there&#39;s the community aspect which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.350" end="00:36:51.720" style="s2">parallel which I think you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.610" end="00:36:53.910" style="s2">trying to do as well as us so I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.720" end="00:36:56.790" style="s2">that means that we need to have people</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.910" end="00:36:59.510" style="s2">who are kind of training the trainer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.790" end="00:37:02.070" style="s2">to go out there start their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.510" end="00:37:03.810" style="s2">could be a podcast could be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.070" end="00:37:04.980" style="s2">documentary could be art of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.810" end="00:37:06.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about a lot of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.980" end="00:37:08.760" style="s2">but just start their own community where</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.810" end="00:37:09.930" style="s2">they are so plug into online communities</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.760" end="00:37:12.180" style="s2">like what we&#39;re doing and then start</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.930" end="00:37:15.210" style="s2">your own thing as well so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.180" end="00:37:17.640" style="s2">three things I would say that practice</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.210" end="00:37:19.050" style="s2">is a huge part of it because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.640" end="00:37:21.390" style="s2">just that people need to be having</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.050" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">conversations and I think that was one</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.390" end="00:37:26.610" style="s2">of the maybe failings of the integral</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.710" style="s2">movement is that it just became very</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.610" end="00:37:31.050" style="s2">intellectual you know people are just</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.710" end="00:37:32.970" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re all so integral and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.050" end="00:37:35.550" style="s2">having these integral conversations but</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.970" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">no change is actually happening so</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.550" end="00:37:44.070" style="s2">change comes through practice and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:46.650" style="s2">know accessing that liminal space where</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.070" end="00:37:49.080" style="s2">your previous sense of self your</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.650" end="00:37:53.120" style="s2">previous sense of the world can dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.080" end="00:37:57.290" style="s2">so that&#39;s something new can emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.120" end="00:38:00.020" style="s2">I think that giving people maybe a set</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.290" end="00:38:01.880" style="s2">of practices but something that they can</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.020" end="00:38:04.310" style="s2">do on their own without supervision</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.880" end="00:38:06.170" style="s2">without guidance and a way to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.310" end="00:38:08.570" style="s2">self-organize is going to be really</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.170" end="00:38:11.180" style="s2">useful something simple and replicable</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.570" end="00:38:14.330" style="s2">yeah I agree with that I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.180" end="00:38:16.190" style="s2">also a big missing piece and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.330" end="00:38:19.460" style="s2">big reasons that it&#39;s so difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.190" end="00:38:21.500" style="s2">get us all to go kind of post egoic and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.460" end="00:38:23.960" style="s2">stay there and be anti fragile in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.500" end="00:38:26.750" style="s2">and not not crumble when when the stakes</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.960" end="00:38:28.550" style="s2">get higher is that we need something</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.750" end="00:38:30.710" style="s2">some higher order purpose which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.550" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">higher than the ego that everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.710" end="00:38:36.230" style="s2">aimed towards and we used to have that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:37.640" style="s2">and I feel often in the conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.230" end="00:38:40.310" style="s2">high level conversation there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.640" end="00:38:43.190" style="s2">euphemisms for god or for the divine or</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.310" end="00:38:44.780" style="s2">for the mystery or whatever it is and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.190" end="00:38:46.910" style="s2">don&#39;t think it needs necessarily to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.780" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">named but I think you know young talked</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.910" end="00:38:50.570" style="s2">about this as well and just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:52.430" style="s2">the ego in the self if the ego doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.570" end="00:38:54.350" style="s2">have the self to sit within and the ego</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.430" end="00:38:55.610" style="s2">thinks it&#39;s above the self then you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.350" end="00:38:57.650" style="s2">the narcissus and then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.610" end="00:39:00.110" style="s2">confusion you need something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.650" end="00:39:03.740" style="s2">contextualizes the ego but I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.110" end="00:39:06.080" style="s2">complicated thing is how do we find that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.740" end="00:39:07.820" style="s2">thing or what is that thing how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.080" end="00:39:10.220" style="s2">even point people towards that thing in</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.820" end="00:39:12.410" style="s2">a way they agree to you know because</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.220" end="00:39:14.420" style="s2">that I think is very important there</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.410" end="00:39:16.250" style="s2">needs to be some sense of we are all</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.420" end="00:39:18.650" style="s2">working towards some higher purpose or</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.250" end="00:39:20.690" style="s2">just some higher and I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.650" end="00:39:22.730" style="s2">that higher purpose should be framed at</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.690" end="00:39:23.990" style="s2">but it feels like a very important piece</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.730" end="00:39:26.750" style="s2">that&#39;s missing because that brings</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.990" end="00:39:30.980" style="s2">humility and it also brings shared focus</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.750" end="00:39:32.630" style="s2">and intention mm-hmm yeah I I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.980" end="00:39:35.900" style="s2">with that one actually to define that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.630" end="00:39:39.500" style="s2">for myself because I mean I have worked</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.900" end="00:39:42.530" style="s2">really hard to to remove desire and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.500" end="00:39:44.180" style="s2">remove ego from as much as I can in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.530" end="00:39:46.520" style="s2">day to day life I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.180" end="00:39:50.870" style="s2">cop that&#39;s mission accomplished but and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.520" end="00:39:54.410" style="s2">I think to a degree what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.870" end="00:39:57.020" style="s2">future thinkers I have done it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.410" end="00:40:01.010" style="s2">that cleans the purpose of it like we</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.020" end="00:40:03.980" style="s2">are is I want to have fun doing what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.010" end="00:40:06.080" style="s2">doing and I want to affect people but</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.980" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">beyond that the day to day if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.080" end="00:40:08.810" style="s2">fun it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:12.590" style="s2">achieved I&#39;m not gonna do it anymore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.810" end="00:40:16.900" style="s2">not gonna work on it if if it affects</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.590" end="00:40:20.060" style="s2">people then that&#39;s just a byproduct and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.900" end="00:40:22.610" style="s2">I think the fact that that&#39;s my one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.060" end="00:40:24.200" style="s2">my first priorities cleans the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.610" end="00:40:26.090" style="s2">of it where it&#39;s like I&#39;m not attached</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.200" end="00:40:27.560" style="s2">to some result I don&#39;t need your money I</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.090" end="00:40:30.650" style="s2">don&#39;t need your approval I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.560" end="00:40:32.660" style="s2">your you know respect I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.650" end="00:40:34.190" style="s2">have fun and share what I&#39;m passionate</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.660" end="00:40:36.050" style="s2">about some of these subjects that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.190" end="00:40:37.400" style="s2">talking about I think that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.050" end="00:40:45.500" style="s2">same you&#39;re more Purpose Driven than I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.400" end="00:40:47.870" style="s2">am but but I I think removing the desire</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.500" end="00:40:50.390" style="s2">to be something or signal something or</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.870" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">achieve something has really cleaned the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.390" end="00:40:53.900" style="s2">whole thing for me so I&#39;m not chasing</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:55.850" style="s2">after money I&#39;m not chasing after</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.900" end="00:40:59.090" style="s2">approval anything like that like I used</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.850" end="00:41:02.150" style="s2">to but I think what Alex was saying is</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.090" end="00:41:05.590" style="s2">that there needs to be something greater</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.150" end="00:41:10.910" style="s2">for it to fall back on because not</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.590" end="00:41:14.060" style="s2">everybody can just exist in that void in</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.910" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">that empty space like that&#39;s it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.060" end="00:41:18.530" style="s2">more difficult you know it&#39;s like a few</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">steps down so something greater than</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.530" end="00:41:22.100" style="s2">yourself to rest on is a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:25.580" style="s2">achievable for the majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.100" end="00:41:27.470" style="s2">whether that&#39;s God or nature the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.580" end="00:41:31.070" style="s2">or the universe the divine whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.470" end="00:41:32.870" style="s2">call it but if people disagree on what</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.070" end="00:41:35.240" style="s2">that is then it can cause problems in</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.870" end="00:41:38.360" style="s2">the cream I think it also allows for for</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.240" end="00:41:42.020" style="s2">those those kind of we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.360" end="00:41:43.580" style="s2">branches as a metaphor yesterday like</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.020" end="00:41:45.260" style="s2">swinging from branch to branch like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.580" end="00:41:47.140" style="s2">monkey it&#39;s like you go from one</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.260" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">ideology and then that ideology</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.140" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">collapses and you have to grab on to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:53.120" style="s2">something else and what I&#39;m attempting</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:57.260" style="s2">to do is just to let go altogether and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.120" end="00:41:59.120" style="s2">see what happens and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.260" end="00:42:00.980" style="s2">big part of the problem in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.120" end="00:42:02.600" style="s2">conversation is people are operating</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.980" end="00:42:05.170" style="s2">from their different ideologies and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.600" end="00:42:08.330" style="s2">trying to like co-opt other people and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.170" end="00:42:11.240" style="s2">or convert and I just think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.330" end="00:42:14.360" style="s2">that needs to stop and for us to just</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.240" end="00:42:16.310" style="s2">you know kind of go both end like accept</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.360" end="00:42:18.950" style="s2">all the positions and not really hold</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.310" end="00:42:21.020" style="s2">tightly to any position and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.950" end="00:42:23.690" style="s2">if I if I hadn&#39;t of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.020" end="00:42:25.550" style="s2">go completely I think I probably will I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.690" end="00:42:28.670" style="s2">probably would have still been pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.550" end="00:42:29.840" style="s2">money and that&#39;s that message and goal</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.670" end="00:42:32.780" style="s2">of future thinkers would have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.840" end="00:42:34.850" style="s2">bastardized in some way but there must</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.780" end="00:42:37.570" style="s2">be like there must be some odd no I say</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.850" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">must be I&#39;m wondering is there the in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.570" end="00:42:42.200" style="s2">letting go psychologically is very</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">difficult to do unless you feel you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.200" end="00:42:45.560" style="s2">gonna be caught unless you feel that say</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:47.990" style="s2">the universe is a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.560" end="00:42:50.570" style="s2">supportive place that it&#39;s safe to let</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.990" end="00:42:52.070" style="s2">go into and I&#39;m wondering if that is how</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.570" end="00:42:54.860" style="s2">you see things because I I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.070" end="00:42:57.800" style="s2">partly what I mean by a sense of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.860" end="00:42:59.540" style="s2">coherence and cohesion in reality that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.800" end="00:43:02.900" style="s2">people agree on as well it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.540" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">important but and that was traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.900" end="00:43:05.930" style="s2">the role that religion would give people</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:07.130" style="s2">for example they would know that there</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.930" end="00:43:09.140" style="s2">is a higher order purpose there is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.130" end="00:43:10.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason to things and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.140" end="00:43:12.920" style="s2">creates a different kind of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.310" end="00:43:14.450" style="s2">now we&#39;re well past you know we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.920" end="00:43:17.240" style="s2">we&#39;re in post modernity so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.450" end="00:43:19.730" style="s2">difficult to just go back to that so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.240" end="00:43:21.770" style="s2">guess that that&#39;s my inquiry is what</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.730" end="00:43:23.390" style="s2">does it look like now how you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.770" end="00:43:27.860" style="s2">decentralized collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.390" end="00:43:30.230" style="s2">what does that shared thing like I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.860" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">verve a key talks about this in probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.230" end="00:43:36.050" style="s2">the most detail and says it in the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:40.190" style="s2">way I think we are in a meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.050" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">and a lot of times in the past that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.190" end="00:43:45.140" style="s2">meaning has been given from religion of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:48.290" style="s2">some kind but it&#39;s also been provided by</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.140" end="00:43:50.210" style="s2">tribes in community and I think we lack</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.290" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">both of those things generally and which</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.210" end="00:43:54.140" style="s2">is why people are just so desperate you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.660" style="s2">know if you kind of let go of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.140" end="00:43:59.000" style="s2">branches I think the tribe is meant to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.660" end="00:44:02.810" style="s2">be there to support you through that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.000" end="00:44:04.790" style="s2">we don&#39;t really have that so that fall</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.810" end="00:44:06.530" style="s2">is potentially dangerous but I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.790" end="00:44:08.570" style="s2">that&#39;s that should be the goal like</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.530" end="00:44:11.300" style="s2">establish a community establish a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.570" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">and then try and let go the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.300" end="00:44:15.830" style="s2">I have with that is that people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:18.440" style="s2">farm meme tribes they form tribes around</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.830" end="00:44:22.250" style="s2">ideology because they desperately need a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.440" end="00:44:25.400" style="s2">tribe so to go back to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.250" end="00:44:28.430" style="s2">is there some shared higher purpose well</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.400" end="00:44:30.200" style="s2">because we are experiencing very serious</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.430" end="00:44:32.210" style="s2">existential risks on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.200" end="00:44:34.390" style="s2">especially climate change which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.210" end="00:44:37.210" style="s2">becoming very</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.390" end="00:44:40.329" style="s2">accelerated and very evident I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.210" end="00:44:43.000" style="s2">that for the time being that shared</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.500" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">myself I don&#39;t know if I can answer it</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.500" end="00:45:09.089" style="s2">in the general I know what it is that</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:22.740" style="s2">that what I have a sense of what that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.950" end="00:45:25.180" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of sense of a verb</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.740" end="00:45:26.380" style="s2">there&#39;s the Buddhist idea of awakening</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.180" end="00:45:28.420" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s a kind of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.380" end="00:45:30.819" style="s2">awakening which is where you awaken and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.420" end="00:45:33.940" style="s2">in some sense that means the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.819" end="00:45:36.430" style="s2">way more intelligent than then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.940" end="00:45:38.529" style="s2">almost conceivable that you realize you</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.210" end="00:45:45.190" style="s2">right you awaken in exactly the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.940" end="00:45:46.690" style="s2">place that we&#39;re all sort of and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.190" end="00:45:50.589" style="s2">kind of what we&#39;re all trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.690" end="00:45:52.150" style="s2">in some in some sense like this and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.589" end="00:45:53.470" style="s2">all have to find that for ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.150" end="00:45:56.170" style="s2">we have to find that kind of awakening</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.470" end="00:45:58.329" style="s2">into the place where we&#39;re meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.170" end="00:46:01.630" style="s2">with exactly the right history and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.329" end="00:46:03.190" style="s2">having achieved all of giving ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:46:03.190" end="00:46:07.240" style="s2">need to do next and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.500" end="00:46:09.660" style="s2">that we all have to come to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.240" end="00:46:12.250" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to generalize and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.660" end="00:46:14.259" style="s2">because when you start looking for this</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.250" end="00:46:16.299" style="s2">grand explanation what you end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.259" end="00:46:17.890" style="s2">is coming right back down to the level</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.299" end="00:46:21.430" style="s2">of the individual and right back down to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.890" end="00:46:23.380" style="s2">the very almost the microscopic I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.430" end="00:46:27.250" style="s2">the the kind of clean your room is not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.380" end="00:46:28.869" style="s2">ridiculous place to start but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.250" end="00:46:31.029" style="s2">missing piece in that that I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.869" end="00:46:32.500" style="s2">of people react against in in Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.029" end="00:46:35.230" style="s2">Peterson is he doesn&#39;t make the next</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.500" end="00:46:37.509" style="s2">step like clean your room sort yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.230" end="00:46:41.440" style="s2">out first and then you&#39;ll know what to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.509" end="00:46:42.970" style="s2">do next and then there&#39;s that when you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.440" end="00:46:46.059" style="s2">break it down like that it almost sounds</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.970" end="00:46:47.799" style="s2">like magical thinking and it and when</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.059" end="00:46:48.190" style="s2">you expect when you explain it in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.799" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.190" end="00:46:51.970" style="s2">sound like magical thing is what do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:53.710" style="s2">mean how can that be when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.970" end="00:46:56.200" style="s2">the the ice caps melting and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.710" end="00:46:57.730" style="s2">biodiversity loss and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.200" end="00:47:02.799" style="s2">require structures to deal with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.730" end="00:47:06.369" style="s2">like all I can do is say is trust that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.799" end="00:47:09.099" style="s2">all of the people who have caught been</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.369" end="00:47:10.869" style="s2">called into making that particular area</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.099" end="00:47:12.460" style="s2">of because I&#39;m not I&#39;m not a climate</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.869" end="00:47:14.020" style="s2">scientist I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.460" end="00:47:15.819" style="s2">anywhere near enough about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.020" end="00:47:18.250" style="s2">things to say anything definitive I</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.819" end="00:47:21.010" style="s2">sense that same level of existential</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.250" end="00:47:23.770" style="s2">threat and I think that the crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.010" end="00:47:25.270" style="s2">that is a manifestation or is far deeper</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.770" end="00:47:28.089" style="s2">and I&#39;m interested in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.270" end="00:47:28.990" style="s2">philosophical roots of that crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.089" end="00:47:31.270" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.990" end="00:47:34.869" style="s2">I&#39;m personally speaking to in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.270" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">interviews and documentaries that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.869" end="00:47:38.799" style="s2">making and I know that I can do that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:42.579" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think I meant to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.799" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">but all I can do is have faith that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.579" end="00:47:47.289" style="s2">people that are that are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:51.220" style="s2">those conversations are having similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.289" end="00:47:52.809" style="s2">awakening moments to the ones that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.220" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">having and I see the people around me</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.809" end="00:47:59.460" style="s2">having that that will be the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:48:02.440" style="s2">gets if not all of us but at least as</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.460" end="00:48:05.349" style="s2">many of us as possible through what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.440" end="00:48:09.400" style="s2">to come does that speak to them to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.349" end="00:48:11.410" style="s2">question or not yeah it does it inspired</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.400" end="00:48:14.349" style="s2">the next train of thought here for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.410" end="00:48:15.789" style="s2">which is you mentioned Peterson saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.349" end="00:48:18.660" style="s2">just clean up your room and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.789" end="00:48:22.539" style="s2">like okay what&#39;s the next step I really</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.660" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">feel that what the next step is there</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.539" end="00:48:27.279" style="s2">that and I&#39;ve kind of feel the reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:29.799" style="s2">he&#39;s not saying it because there is no</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.279" end="00:48:32.109" style="s2">road map that can just be handed you you</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.799" end="00:48:35.289" style="s2">do have to just keep kind of climbing on</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.109" end="00:48:37.270" style="s2">your own and for a lot of people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.289" end="00:48:39.160" style="s2">they&#39;re freaked out by the state of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.270" end="00:48:41.079" style="s2">world but they&#39;re you know the room</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.160" end="00:48:42.760" style="s2">isn&#39;t clean they&#39;re in that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.079" end="00:48:45.099" style="s2">metaphor like their life isn&#39;t clean</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.760" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">that they&#39;re kind of grasping onto one</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.099" end="00:48:48.069" style="s2">thing or another and emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:50.349" style="s2">reacting to nearly everything and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.069" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that in the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.349" end="00:48:54.460" style="s2">our society converses and tries to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:56.049" style="s2">decisions collectively that is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.460" end="00:49:00.490" style="s2">causing a lot of problems like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.049" end="00:49:01.690" style="s2">reason we can&#39;t collectivise solve some</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.490" end="00:49:04.990" style="s2">of these problems you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.690" end="00:49:06.460" style="s2">make policies that at least try and work</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.990" end="00:49:08.410" style="s2">towards reversing climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.460" end="00:49:09.850" style="s2">that&#39;s just one example like we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.410" end="00:49:11.560" style="s2">just not collectivizing and having</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.850" end="00:49:13.690" style="s2">productive conversations and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.560" end="00:49:17.340" style="s2">IDW is attempting to show people how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.690" end="00:49:20.790" style="s2">have productive conversations again so</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.340" end="00:49:26.530" style="s2">there&#39;s something about sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.790" end="00:49:29.620" style="s2">individual mental sovereignty that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.530" end="00:49:31.750" style="s2">important here where I feel like if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.620" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">if you&#39;re looking for meaning in these</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.750" end="00:49:35.470" style="s2">different things like out meaning in it</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:37.120" style="s2">as an I must contribute to the world I</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.470" end="00:49:39.340" style="s2">must change the world and it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.120" end="00:49:41.080" style="s2">haven&#39;t done that individual quiet work</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.340" end="00:49:44.170" style="s2">of cleaning your room cleaning your life</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.080" end="00:49:46.870" style="s2">then you&#39;re you&#39;re not gonna be prepared</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.170" end="00:49:48.430" style="s2">to make the right steps in the world you</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.870" end="00:49:50.260" style="s2">might be responding to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.430" end="00:49:51.490" style="s2">internal lack or fear and you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.260" end="00:49:52.660" style="s2">to be taking actions that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.490" end="00:49:56.020" style="s2">necessarily going to be the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.660" end="00:49:58.450" style="s2">for the world so that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.020" end="00:50:00.460" style="s2">kind of self-evident in what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.450" end="00:50:02.200" style="s2">what the next step will be it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.460" end="00:50:04.060" style="s2">there&#39;s so much work to be done</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.200" end="00:50:06.910" style="s2">individually and then the path every</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.060" end="00:50:09.970" style="s2">next step lays itself out for you as you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.910" end="00:50:12.070" style="s2">go and I think there&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.970" end="00:50:14.590" style="s2">that&#39;s quite interesting about the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.070" end="00:50:17.620" style="s2">or the intellectual deep web and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.590" end="00:50:20.290" style="s2">specifically to what Jordan green Hall</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.620" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">or Green Jordan Hall and Daniels Martin</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.290" end="00:50:23.470" style="s2">Berger have been saying and not</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:25.180" style="s2">necessarily what they&#39;re saying but how</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.850" end="00:51:05.290" style="s2">you can do it like when you&#39;re climbing</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.700" end="00:51:08.230" style="s2">you&#39;re just worried about the next step</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.290" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">just keep going the next footing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.230" end="00:51:12.010" style="s2">almost like they&#39;re describing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:13.660" style="s2">landscape that&#39;s up up ahead but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.010" end="00:51:15.420" style="s2">don&#39;t need to know that to get there</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.660" end="00:51:18.900" style="s2">most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.420" end="00:51:20.789" style="s2">yeah and I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.900" end="00:51:22.500" style="s2">reason Peterson&#39;s been so successful is</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.789" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">because he has surveyed the land and</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.500" end="00:51:26.910" style="s2">he&#39;s not really shouting back these</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:28.410" style="s2">detailed instructions at people he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.910" end="00:51:30.990" style="s2">just saying take the next step</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.410" end="00:51:32.579" style="s2">clean your room you know do that next</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.990" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">thing because people are so lost and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.579" end="00:51:36.089" style="s2">they&#39;re basically stuck at their base</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:38.099" style="s2">camp and not moving so he&#39;s just saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.089" end="00:51:40.019" style="s2">start climbing again start climbing well</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.099" end="00:51:42.119" style="s2">I also want to just throw something more</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.019" end="00:51:43.650" style="s2">in here just in case people are watching</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.119" end="00:51:47.069" style="s2">this and haven&#39;t seen much of Peters and</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.650" end="00:51:48.750" style="s2">stuff because you can&#39;t break down like</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.069" end="00:51:51.990" style="s2">if you watch the maps of meaning lecture</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.750" end="00:51:53.940" style="s2">series compared to his 12 rules for life</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.990" end="00:51:56.849" style="s2">for example which I have to admit I</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.940" end="00:51:58.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t finished reading the the maps of</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.849" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2">meaning lecture series is a is an</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.680" end="00:52:06.299" style="s2">absolute tour-de-force it&#39;s an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:07.190" style="s2">masterpiece of a coherent in theory of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.299" end="00:52:10.140" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.190" end="00:52:11.549" style="s2">similar to Ken echoes of Ken Wilber for</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.140" end="00:52:14.099" style="s2">me and the kind of the breadth and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.549" end="00:52:16.710" style="s2">attempt at linking together all of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.099" end="00:52:19.980" style="s2">kind of mythologies and stories into a</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.710" end="00:52:22.019" style="s2">coherent framework so it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.980" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">not that all he&#39;s offering is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.019" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">cleaning your room and do the things you</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:28.380" style="s2">can do there is a there is a much</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:30.569" style="s2">broader vision that that I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.380" end="00:52:34.170" style="s2">don&#39;t think as many people as I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.569" end="00:52:36.509" style="s2">like or aware of but yeah I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.170" end="00:52:37.710" style="s2">to sort of throw that in there just I do</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.509" end="00:52:39.779" style="s2">a little shout out to the maps of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.710" end="00:52:41.880" style="s2">meaning series yeah it was awesome</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.779" end="00:52:46.019" style="s2">actually it&#39;s it&#39;s what got me into</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.880" end="00:52:47.849" style="s2">Jordan Peterson as well I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.019" end="00:52:52.039" style="s2">speak to the sovereignty peace and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.849" end="00:52:55.529" style="s2">think that it&#39;s an extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.039" end="00:52:57.930" style="s2">process and practice coming into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.529" end="00:53:02.220" style="s2">world that we&#39;re living in now and for</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.930" end="00:53:05.430" style="s2">the future so sovereignty as in having</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.220" end="00:53:08.039" style="s2">an internal compass having internal</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.430" end="00:53:11.059" style="s2">authority for where you&#39;re going instead</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.039" end="00:53:14.579" style="s2">of looking for some external person</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.059" end="00:53:16.650" style="s2">authority figure system map to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.579" end="00:53:18.980" style="s2">what to do anywhere to go because the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.650" end="00:53:21.210" style="s2">the ground is shifting beneath our feet</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.980" end="00:53:23.849" style="s2">even the authorities or so-called</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.210" end="00:53:25.619" style="s2">authorities don&#39;t know where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.849" end="00:53:28.049" style="s2">going they&#39;re just doing their best and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.619" end="00:53:28.740" style="s2">the people who seem to be making the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.049" end="00:53:30.690" style="s2">most sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.740" end="00:53:32.970" style="s2">are in fact operating in that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.690" end="00:53:35.400" style="s2">space where the ground is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.970" end="00:53:38.070" style="s2">shifting underneath their feet and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.400" end="00:53:40.320" style="s2">think that that is maybe the most useful</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.070" end="00:53:43.080" style="s2">thing that people can do is find their</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.320" end="00:53:45.300" style="s2">own internal compass so that all they</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.080" end="00:53:47.070" style="s2">really need is for somebody to just</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.300" end="00:53:49.980" style="s2">encourage them and say keep going and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.070" end="00:53:51.510" style="s2">this is doable and nothing more they</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.980" end="00:53:53.220" style="s2">have to figure out everything else by</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.510" end="00:53:55.290" style="s2">themselves and I know that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.220" end="00:53:56.850" style="s2">harsh and it doesn&#39;t land well with a</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.290" end="00:53:58.920" style="s2">lot of people that we try to tell this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.850" end="00:54:01.380" style="s2">to what I really deeply think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.920" end="00:54:02.790" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s necessary right now and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.380" end="00:54:05.010" style="s2">yet if you look at the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.790" end="00:54:07.080" style="s2">that that is the that is every story</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.010" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the space of going from</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.080" end="00:54:12.090" style="s2">dependency and a lack of agency and lack</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.430" style="s2">of sovereignty to having to make the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.090" end="00:54:17.100" style="s2">choices for yourself to decide who am i</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.430" end="00:54:18.420" style="s2">what kind of person am i and the hero or</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.100" end="00:54:21.480" style="s2">heroine makes those choices and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.420" end="00:54:23.340" style="s2">they are someone else at the end yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.480" end="00:54:25.170" style="s2">and continuing with that metaphor there</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.340" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">there is usually in the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.170" end="00:54:29.250" style="s2">that wise character that hands the tool</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">the sword the map the ring whatever to</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.250" end="00:54:33.480" style="s2">the hero that allows them to cross cross</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:38.430" style="s2">the threshold and achieve their goal but</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.480" end="00:54:39.780" style="s2">it&#39;s never like a full map yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.430" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">another sort of jumping off point but</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.780" end="00:54:48.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard it said many times where are</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:50.780" style="s2">the elders mm-hmm yeah I our elders have</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.660" end="00:54:53.400" style="s2">not gone through what we&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.780" end="00:54:55.380" style="s2">they were not born into the internet</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.400" end="00:54:57.380" style="s2">they were not born in the transition of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.380" end="00:54:59.910" style="s2">the Internet they&#39;re barely keeping on</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.380" end="00:55:03.600" style="s2">you know keeping up with what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.910" end="00:55:06.750" style="s2">and and things are moving so fast that</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.600" end="00:55:08.760" style="s2">they&#39;ll never keep up so we&#39;re in need</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.750" end="00:55:10.890" style="s2">of new elders like we basically have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.760" end="00:55:12.690" style="s2">be that this internet generation of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.890" end="00:55:14.790" style="s2">Millennials we have to kind of establish</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.690" end="00:55:18.780" style="s2">a system in our own ranks to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.790" end="00:55:20.369" style="s2">push people through wisdom to be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.780" end="00:55:23.400" style="s2">elders for the next generation cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.369" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">basically in that crossing the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.400" end="00:55:27.869" style="s2">State there&#39;s just not no one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:29.550" style="s2">mapped this territory ahead of us barely</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.869" end="00:55:32.609" style="s2">I mean some people are but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.550" end="00:55:34.560" style="s2">they&#39;re barely older than we are there</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.609" end="00:55:36.810" style="s2">any anything that you guys wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.560" end="00:55:39.150" style="s2">before before we wrap up maybe give a</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.810" end="00:55:40.830" style="s2">shout out to your course and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.150" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">that you are doing some of the you are</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.830" end="00:55:45.810" style="s2">providing some of these tools that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:48.450" style="s2">talked about yeah sure well the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.810" end="00:55:50.700" style="s2">courses can be divided into two parts</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.450" end="00:55:53.940" style="s2">there&#39;s sovereignty so how to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.700" end="00:55:56.550" style="s2">clarity in your perception your sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.940" end="00:55:59.130" style="s2">making your agency there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.550" end="00:56:01.650" style="s2">stuff to do with deconstruction of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.130" end="00:56:03.480" style="s2">mind and that one the second part is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.650" end="00:56:05.250" style="s2">about shadow work which is about facing</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.480" end="00:56:07.530" style="s2">your demons facing the shadow in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.250" end="00:56:10.950" style="s2">Jungian sense which i think is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.530" end="00:56:12.210" style="s2">much a necessity to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.950" end="00:56:14.850" style="s2">participate in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.210" end="00:56:16.380" style="s2">intelligence that&#39;s you know a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.850" end="00:56:18.359" style="s2">are trying to converse about in these</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.380" end="00:56:20.250" style="s2">types of conversations and also to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.359" end="00:56:22.410" style="s2">able to contribute meaningfully to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.250" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">world without acting out those</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.410" end="00:56:28.980" style="s2">unconscious traumas or issues yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:31.140" style="s2">you can find at courses dot future</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.980" end="00:56:33.150" style="s2">thinkers org and then our podcast just</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.140" end="00:56:35.910" style="s2">that future thinkers network yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.150" end="00:56:38.940" style="s2">we&#39;re also planning some retreats that</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.910" end="00:56:41.190" style="s2">are going to be probably in Bulgaria or</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.940" end="00:56:44.070" style="s2">Portugal to start and then who knows</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.190" end="00:56:45.470" style="s2">where else that put these things into</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.570" end="00:56:56.250" style="s2">guys I know are doing these retreats</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.609" end="00:56:58.650" style="s2">yeah I really I was hoping to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.250" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">that a bit well come on one and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.650" end="00:57:03.990" style="s2">then you&#39;ll definitely have more to talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:06.810" style="s2">about yeah well do a cultural exchange</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.990" end="00:57:08.630" style="s2">yeah yeah the meant the men&#39;s work we</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.810" end="00:57:11.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing for quite a long time</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.630" end="00:57:15.030" style="s2">since we we set up our own men&#39;s group</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.940" end="00:57:18.690" style="s2">found it really useful and then expanded</p>
