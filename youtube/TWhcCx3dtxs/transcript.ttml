<p begin="00:00:43.620" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">definitely rekindled after this</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">wording there&#39;s still an element of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.170" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">talking only about the utilitarian value</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:13.189" style="s2">of health to humanity instead of</p>
