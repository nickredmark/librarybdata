<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">and hello to everyone who tuned in i</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">thought i&#39;d just</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">start by saying a few words about my</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">general orientation</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">towards disagreement because it informs</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">my uh suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">for how we move forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">as a society and thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">so i start off with a with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">unconventional</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">view that when we&#39;re trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">about what the human</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">good is when we think about things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">typically</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">are candidates for the human good we</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">talk about things like happiness</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">we might talk about things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">knowledge i talk about things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">beauty i think that up there in the cat</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">that category of things up there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">or something like conflict there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.879" style="s2">good reasons to think that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">and that can go into all the details</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">but that there we do seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">get something quite valuable out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">we tend to enjoy conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">we learn from it however</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">right conflict isn&#39;t the only thing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">that&#39;s of value there are lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">things that might be of value</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">and in trying to figure out what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">of conflict we might want to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">we have to assess which forms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">conflict are compatible with the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">of other kinds of things we value</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">right so you know we value conflict we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">also value relaxation sometimes in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">pleasure and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">time with friends and music and all that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">and so some forms of conflict are</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">completely incompatible</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">with the pursuit of those other goods</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">for example is a form of conflict it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">not a particularly great form of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">conflict because it&#39;s incompatible with</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">most of the other things that we value</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">a watching a video</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">of two other people playing a video game</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">is also in some ways partaking in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">experience with a conflict but it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">other people playing</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">a video game it&#39;s it&#39;s fairly trivial</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not all that significant for most</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">you know watching two other people play</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">a video game</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">uh what we need is uh a form of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">compatible with the other things we care</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">about but something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">gives us what we need out of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">has to be important has to be meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">and so i think that a certain range of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">that we typically typically call moral</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">disagreement or political disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">hit that sweet spot</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">that is they provide us with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">good things that we need out of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">but are also</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">quite compatible with most of the things</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">we we value in life and so we should</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">think of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">moral you know conflict is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">human good</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">and moral disagreement political</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">disagreement as especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">excellent forms of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">which means that these things are good</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">for us which means that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">the typical orientation towards them</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">which is to think of disagreement as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">as something to overcome or something</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">that we just have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">grapple with and live with like but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">a huge problem that we&#39;re just never</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">going to get rid of right to think of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">negatively right i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">mistake and i think it leads us to other</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">kinds of mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:02.880" style="s2">rather if we see this agreement as</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">something that on balance is positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.880" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">appreciate it more</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">so this kind of positive feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">how i think to to to do it well do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.039" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">changing this mindset isn&#39;t a panacea</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not going to solve</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">you know get rid of war we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">you know get to some kind of utopia</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:26.479" style="s2">but i do think uh our lives will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">better if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.479" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">better attitude towards this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">is a part of our lives for better or</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.160" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">and i think i&#39;ll just stop there as kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">of intro remarks</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">i i&#39;m happy to say more about any of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">that but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">leave peter to prompt me or the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">you sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:44.479" style="s2">um so if you have any questions for</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">justin just throw them in the chats</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">um i could be wrong but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">most people would agree with that like</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">yeah this agreement is good i like</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">you know i think it&#39;s healthy to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">good disagreement um but</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just lip service a lot of the times</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">and they don&#39;t do it well</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">um so would you agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">statement and um</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">the other question i have is how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">disagree well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">okay well so um you know i&#39;m coming out</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">academic philosophy and if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:16.720" style="s2">uh the course descriptions for say</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">a moral problems class you&#39;ll read the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.720" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">course description and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:21.680" style="s2">something like you&#39;ll learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">reason well about these issues over</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.680" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">which we disagree so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">come to some kind of better agreement</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">about them right so make some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">or if you look at what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.319" style="s2">political philosophy a lot of political</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">philosophy is dedicated to figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.319" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">how people who disagree can somehow come</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">to some kind of agreement like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">is this thought of this this we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">perpetual problem we&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">get rid of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">so we have to do the second best thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">of accommodating it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">right and then when it comes to you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">outside the realm of philosophy like us</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">in our everyday lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">uh i do think that the perception of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">like what&#39;s going on online for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">all this disagreement&#39;s happening online</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">it&#39;s generally thought of in a negative</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">when we step back and intellectually we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">have in our histories</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">certain arguments say from john started</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">with others that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">argument is positive i think culturally</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">there is a negative balance towards it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">to be avoided something to be resolved</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">something to get over</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">something that at best is just some</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">instrument to some point in time where</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing this anymore or this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">the disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">so i i think maybe you know you like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">you&#39;re a former you know philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this thing where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">you&#39;re disagreeing and talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">all the time so</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">of course they&#39;re going to be exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">to the general sense of things and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">but i think the general sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">is that it&#39;s fairly negative</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a yeah there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">confirmation bias i have so</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">that is true um uh yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">how to disagree well okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">like that&#39;s a that&#39;s a huge question</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">this is something that that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">yourself have worked on a bit uh and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">have some interesting suggestions for</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">uh i i think it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">to understand that any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">cultural change is going to be taking a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">usually we can&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">uh you know to institute some rule or</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">some policy and suddenly to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">long-standing forms of human interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">change and it starts this thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">happens slowly over time and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:36.320" style="s2">ways in which it starts slowly</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">is by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">values explicitly and then changing what</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">people care about slowly over time</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s uh maybe even educating people</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">starting from very young in different</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">ways so as to come to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">different things of value</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">so i i think that it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">the benefits of disagreement and be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">clear about them</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">making making the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">disagreement clear to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">is one way of making it more attractive</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">and one way of getting people to see it</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">uh as something that they might want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">do well so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">the kind of steps along the process so</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">how is disagreement good for us</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:19.279" style="s2">right so so they&#39;re classic arguments as</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">i mentioned before from john stuart mill</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.279" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">about okay people disagree and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">learn from that disagreement their</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">epistemic benefits</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">like that um of course disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">makes the world a more interesting place</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">right people with different ideas coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">into conflict with one another the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">conflict itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:38.240" style="s2">it can be interesting and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">products of that kind of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.240" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">can be interesting and lots of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">products are the result</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">of conflict that&#39;s hidden somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">uh in their history i in doing some</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">research on this i learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">that tango for example the dance form</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">has its origin</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">in uh a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">marching sort of physical conflict where</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">um the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">slaves in brazil at a certain time were</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">mocking the slave owners with a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">kind of movement in parades</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">and that became the basis for tango so</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">so even you know cultural goods can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">you know have their other origin in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">um i i have this idea of what i call</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">rival benefit which is the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">who disagree with one another benefit</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">from each other in virtue of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">of their disagreement there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">examples of this uh i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">i i talk about some in the art world but</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">uh sports fandom</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">is as a key example of this uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s much more fun to go to a game</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">and root for your team when the opposing</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">team&#39;s fans are there and also rooting</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">for theirs</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">you know you&#39;re getting something out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">that rivalry there that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">pleasure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">that&#39;s of course that&#39;s just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">fun type of example but</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">i think there are many examples of rival</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">benefit and if we come to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">explicate these share them talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">them point them out</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">become familiar with them we might come</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">to see those who with whom we typically</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">as not this enemy necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">but as a much more complicated person</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">with whom we&#39;re in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">right there&#39;s some things in which we</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">oppose one another but we also</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">benefit each other in some ways right of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">course not all disagreements have that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.079" style="s2">characteristic but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">but some do and so these are i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.079" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">wanna i can talk for a really long time</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna stop</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s less exciting just to hear me</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">talk i think and to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">um i do think that the first the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">steps income</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">in coming to a place where we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">better is coming to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">why we might want to keep disagreeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">and we have to see why it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">the question is coming up now um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">related to what i mentioned at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">so i&#39;m planning to launch a platonic</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">fight club here at the stoa so we get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">practice disagreeing together</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s sort of like a container uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">and i think it would be really good to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">have a course</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">i was thinking about this for a while</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">having a course on reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:23.360" style="s2">where to discuss kind of like um dave</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">chomber&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.360" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">distinction between verbal disputes</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">versus like factual disputes and his</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">method elimination</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">um and uh and i&#39;m curious how much of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">the nuts and bolts would need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">like do i talk about deductive reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">inductive reasoning validity you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">premises conclusions all that type of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">stuff fallacies because</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">i find a lot of people especially the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">store really intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">and they might not know you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">kind of like uh the analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">how to make of the argument structure</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">but they they argue anyways and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">reason well</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:55.760" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious how much do you think</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">that is needed in order to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">disagree well a kind of an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">of the nuts and bolts of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">it depends on on who we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">improve and what their current level is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">right what do we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">to make someone a better disagreer</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">right i do think that having</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">formal tools and understanding of how</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:24.720" style="s2">arguments work what counts as a ballot</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.720" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">uh how pieces of information</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">might not fit together the way they</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">would seem you know and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">mistakes in arguments i do often though</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">some formal knowledge wielded in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">dismissive and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">unhelpful and unhelpful ways right you</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">give people a few tools</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">about logic give them a few fallacies</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">that they can now identify and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">they&#39;re just off to the races</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">you know getting at the formal features</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">of arguments in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">of course you know we want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">attention to that but can sometimes miss</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">the bars for the trees</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">right if we look at people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">dissatisfaction with public</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">discussion nowadays i don&#39;t think like</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">the top of the list</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:16.800" style="s2">is you know people keep committing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">you know they&#39;re affirming the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">antecedent or they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">they&#39;re that i think fallacies are</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">the the main concern they&#39;re probably on</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">the list right people are reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">badly about each other&#39;s views</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">but i think people feel generally first</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">of all misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">or partially understood right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear that those who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">disagreeing with them really understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">the view that they have um and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">i think mutual misunderstanding is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">worry</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">and that if we got better at</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:51.040" style="s2">understanding what other people are up</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.040" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">and what they cared about that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">thing another thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">understanding why if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">disagreeing over something controversial</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">it&#39;s controversial understanding why</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">he&#39;s controversial like this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">that that discussion is controversial is</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">often part of the controversy</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">around it and if you&#39;re discussing this</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">with someone who has a differing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">view to you and you get the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">they just don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">what makes this such a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">then you&#39;re not going to get a lot out</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">of you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">you might not feel like that argument is</p>

<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">so uh i would i would focus</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">in addition to logical nuts and bolts</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">which i think are important</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:48.560" style="s2">i would focus on trying to get into</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">the shoes of other people right the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.560" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">perspective recognizing that when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">interact with people in certain formats</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">like in online format we&#39;re seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">sliver</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">of the whole person and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">that just as we ourselves are not this</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">sliver that we put online</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">where the sliver that is our view on</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">this particular topic</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">right um that uh you know we&#39;re there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">more to us</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">so getting people to somehow recognize</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">of what our debates it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">um the whole person there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">whole person back there with this view</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">that matters uh i think those elements</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">are really</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">crucial as well and are often overlooked</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">yeah what uh came to mind to circle back</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">to the the first part that he said</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">i think it was um robert tales and scott</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">aiken they call it weaponized metal</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">language how they take like</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">abuse it and weaponize it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">um i think ben burgess calls it like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.840" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">logic bros we&#39;re like just like throwing</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">um and so and then the second part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">what you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">uh like what comes to mind is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">intellectual humility applying to things</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.440" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">like principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">of uh charity is there any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">heuristics or principles you can tease</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">out in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">come to understanding or in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">come to with that disposition of</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">yeah well i think i think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s really challenging uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure that there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">good shortcuts</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">right if you&#39;re i don&#39;t wanna i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">um it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a heuristic right</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the hard work of sometimes having</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">done your homework and then if not</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">having done your homework</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">and you sometimes have to to defer to</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">seem to be in a better epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">position because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">this is what they&#39;re a specialist in or</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">maybe this is about</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">experiences that they&#39;ve undergone that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">you haven&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">so i i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">being aware of what you don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.919" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">being sensitive to that is a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:39.120" style="s2">disagreeing well um</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">so yeah so uh what again so when it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.120" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">comes to like a handy set of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">shortcuts</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:53.120" style="s2">how i guess there&#39;s always this one um</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">if uh if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.120" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">really happy about</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">how the argument is going that should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">a danger sign to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">i think um like if you think if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">think you&#39;re doing really well</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">right and this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">over a long-standing seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">intractable issue</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">and it looks like you&#39;re just completely</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">killing it here</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">that suggests that you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">something right probably right</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">and so that should just be you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">maybe maybe you&#39;re not making any</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">mistakes maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">you&#39;re just doing wonderful time maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">your interlocutor has certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">failings</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">but i do think that that&#39;s sometimes uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">a good uh warning light</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">to be uncarved for right</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">so i&#39;ll pivot to the the chats in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">moment just uh one last question</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">um do you think deep disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">uh what robert foglin called deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">disagreements how</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">certain disagreements that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">resolved through argumentation do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">think that&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">and if so how to respond to them</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">i i think lots of i think most uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">arguments and disagreements i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:05.840" style="s2">think that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">should have uh hope that most of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.840" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">are going to be resolved so</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">uh i certainly think that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">uh we&#39;re never going to run out okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">so i i don&#39;t wan i&#39;m i don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">seen as</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">never make progress on certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">questions over which we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">we certainly may but what we end up</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">finding out when we come to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">some kind of agreement on on some</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:36.559" style="s2">previously contentious issue</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">is that the issue is much more</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.559" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">complicated than we thought and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">this dayton that we&#39;re yeah that gives</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">you know which we agree just gives us a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">sense a pause a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">pause by which we can then recognize all</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">the future questions that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">deal with i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">in a way this is how philosophy makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">right philosophy in a way never runs out</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">of questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">what we end up finding out is um even if</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">can answer some some question in some</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">and so philosophy progresses by</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">about all the reasonable questions there</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">the things we don&#39;t know and i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">disagreement in a way is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">like that uh we may end up</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">resolving for a little while but but</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know it&#39;s always</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">further questions for us to disagree</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">over and furthermore</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">i think we&#39;re the kinds of beings who</p>

<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">like to engage in disagreement various</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">uh some forms of conflict and</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna have to scream it for a</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">my question</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">all right um are you familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">stanovich&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.840" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">cognitive decoupling or the ability to</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">experiential knowledge john nurse wrote</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">an interesting piece on the sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">ezra klein debate where he broke down</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">on why their discussion went so badly it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">had a lot to do with their respective</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">approaches to the actual process of</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">and it seems like there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">shared vision regarding regarding</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">how to go about having complicated</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">discussions and this isn&#39;t usually</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">practical no one will allow the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">person to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">set the rules and engagement yet it</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">seems clear that those rules are</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">imperative</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s an important observation uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">all that familiar i&#39;m familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">term decoupling and i have a sense of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">what it refers to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">and i agree with your point</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">that the parties to disagreement are</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">unlikely to each is not likely to allow</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">the other to set the terms of the debate</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">especially if they think that the terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">advantage one position</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">over another in a way that&#39;s unpaperable</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">and i actually don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">mistake</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">because the sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">we can distinguish between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:44.840" style="s2">substantive matter</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">that we&#39;re debating over and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.840" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">the formal features</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">like we&#39;re just going to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">one thing okay right</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">like that&#39;s a move in the debate</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">that has substantive uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">implications for how the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">disagreement will go</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m less convinced</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">that we can easily distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">between setting the terms of a debate in</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">some neutral way</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">and making</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">substantive moves right there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">be reasons to suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:24.799" style="s2">taking certain things off the table</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">isolating certain variables</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.799" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">right is going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">have substantive implications for how</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">disagreement goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">but i i guess maybe if we can try to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">honest about what those are</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">that could be some progress but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">think we should pretend</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">to pretend towards neutrality</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">yeah i think i think in um what they</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">actually were debating about isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">really super important but that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">that concept of how uh one person might</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">have a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">um science-minded sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">take a hypothesis and stick and try to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">maintain a a narrow path to iso</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">you know to isolate it from all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">other dependent variables that could</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">exist just</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">you know as straight as an arrow let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">try to figure this out without talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">about a bunch of other things</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">and other people have a very rich</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">context oriented approach towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">discussing things and they they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">they don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">try to really narrow down to one</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">specific aspect</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">and um it it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">very difficult because uh to have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">discussion between those two different</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">types of people which i think are both</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">very common types of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">because those are your life experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">shapes how you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">have that type of discussion and um</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">yeah it was it was fascinating that i i</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">listened to the harris klein debate</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">and it was kind of a train wreck and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand why until</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">um john nurse kind of talked about those</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">specific ways of looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">at how to even go about having the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">debate so it was pretty fascinating to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">me and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">just made me think before i engage with</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">i need to think how is it that they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">engaging like what is their style of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">engagement</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">and what can i do to not clash with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">style of engagement even if it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">way that i would like to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">that&#39;s not an easy thing to do i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">and and we might learn from</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">disagreements that derail</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">that that go badly right so if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">if there comes a point where you and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:37.200" style="s2">your interlocutor</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">thought that you were you thought you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.200" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">were focusing on this one specific claim</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">and you pushed it to a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">debate and then your interlocutor</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">can&#39;t proceed without bringing in these</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">what are we learning right well one</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">conclusion is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">my partner is a low decoupler they stink</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">at arguing right that i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">not probably the best conclusion to draw</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s true but that shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">probably be your first bet</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">the first step might be well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">there&#39;s these i these elements are much</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">right if i don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">happy then that&#39;s something i should</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">quite consistently uh so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to disagree with someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">whose identity</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">is structured around their opinions</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">or religious etc and yet i think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">of people do have their</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.159" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">and it&#39;s a difficult question and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">think it leads</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">to a topic which i think should be part</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">of any discussion about how</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">now uh right now so much of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">our disagreement happens online right</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">in forums where you know we&#39;re sending</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">personality is wrapped up in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">ideology right they&#39;re just all about</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">you can still try to put yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">their shoes</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">and still try to couch various points</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">you might have</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">that they might recognize as</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">acknowledging from their point of view</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">what&#39;s important i would say let&#39;s step</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">back a little bit and maybe we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">educate people not to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">develop their personalities around their</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">ideas as much and and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">i try to impart to my philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:44.879" style="s2">students you know undergraduates</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">you know that in a in a class where we</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">deal with lots of controversial issues</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">they might come in the door with their</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">opinions</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">about things but it&#39;s much less</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">important that they be the one you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">much less important that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">ones who came in with the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">then they&#39;re the ones who leave with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">sense that they have a better justified</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">debate and philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">or at least one of the differences</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">between debate and philosophy right with</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">the point is to be the one who came into</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">the room</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">with the right answer right the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s coming out of the room</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">with a better answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">and um or at least a better better set</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">of questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">right uh and and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">i i try to tell my students you know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">you have a commitment let it be</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">commitment to what&#39;s true and don&#39;t wrap</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">your personality around an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">you&#39;ll go through life</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">worried that your idea some evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">going to overturn</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">your ideology and it&#39;ll turn you into a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">jerk</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">and it&#39;ll be hard to talk to so</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">i totally get the problem that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">dealing with like these</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">the people who&#39;ve wrapped their</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">personality around</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">around an ideology and uh they&#39;re not my</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">favorite people to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">but i should probably take some of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:55.599" style="s2">own advice and acknowledge that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:56.839" style="s2">probably have something valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">contribute</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">and that we should try to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">context that allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">try to see more of their whole person</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">let them see more of our whole person</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:12.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">not just the presentations of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.079" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">ideology which is what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.839" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">online context</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">sorry that was a big rambly but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">hopefully was something helpful</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">thank you sure we love rambling here at</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">the store just for the record</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">um evan uh you&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">hey so um i really like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">saying about disagreement and its role</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">as part of a healthy uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">interact way of interacting and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">the thing that i&#39;m struggling with here</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">is uh you know the the [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">and the the frankfurt sense right</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">communication who&#39;s not really intended</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">to be true truth isn&#39;t the point of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">it seems like the public square</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">is uh to some degree poisoned or</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">infected by</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:00.240" style="s2">[ __ ] and a lot of the examples of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">debate that we see between</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.240" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">public intellectuals are are highly full</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">[ __ ] and that doesn&#39;t seem at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">to me to be a super healthy</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">way of conducting disagreement um so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">just curious what your thoughts are on</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">this phenomenon and if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">suggestions for how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">engage in disagreement in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">less prone to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">uh weaponized [ __ ] being slung</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">okay so yeah [ __ ] is a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">interesting subject</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">and like yeah so so [ __ ] has a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">negative connotation obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">uh and in part i think justly deserved</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">right so [ __ ] in the sense that evan</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">is referring to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">is speech that&#39;s made not because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">right not in regard to the truth at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">but really just</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">uh to give the listener a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">of impression of the speaker or to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">get the listener to do or believe</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">something you know but</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">really not oriented towards the truth or</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">concerned with the truth it said with</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">disregard to the truth</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">um so what should we think about</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">[ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">is [ __ ] the kind of thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">antithetical to good disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">i think the true answer is sometimes all</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure we can come up with lots of</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">examples in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">uh people&#39;s [ __ ] has</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">made a debate or disagreement or</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">discussion go badly</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">i i teach [ __ ] in one of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">undergrad classes</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">and i use as one of the key examples</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">this it&#39;s an old example now so i</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">probably have to update it but uh back</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">in when obama was president uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:42.079" style="s2">senator john kyle got up on the floor of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">the senate</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.079" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">and was complaining about the funding of</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.119" end="00:38:49.760" style="s2">planned parenthood</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">and he says planned parenthood uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.760" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">they with a 97 90</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">of what they fund is abortions right</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">and you know stephen colbert made this</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">the focus of one of his segments and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">colbert says well that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">unbelievable in the sense that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">this true number is like three percent</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">uh of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">planned parenthood&#39;s funding goes</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">towards abortion and as colbert puts it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">kyle just rounded up to the nearest 90.</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">uh so but what was remarkable about this</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">story is that when he was called on it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">what kyle said kyle released a press</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">release that said that was not intended</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">as a factual statement</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">so basically what he said was i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">right so now so so now we are at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">point right</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">where a member of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">legislature</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">know is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:47.760" style="s2">is the problem that we&#39;re kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">this halfway spot</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.760" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">technologically where we&#39;re there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.040" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s this partialness which lends itself</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">uh in person right uh so maybe maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">solution is we need to move more of</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">maybe but i don&#39;t even know what that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">would be i&#39;m not a technofuturist or</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">something like that so i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:21.359" style="s2">grand vision</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.359" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">for for what that would look like where</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.359" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">if we&#39;re more robustly online</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">right i don&#39;t want to be the take the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">letter solution and say well we just</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">right because so</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">um as far as making disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">go better in a context like twitter</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean part of me thinks</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">forced timeouts would be a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">you know i mean or maybe let me reframe</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">what are the spaces online i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">is in my mind one of them but like what</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">are the spaces online</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:58.839" style="s2">leaving twitter aside where you feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">like this kind of discourse has done the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.839" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s it&#39;s tough right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">this is something that i struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">uh so so i&#39;m i run this website daily</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">news it&#39;s mainly for just</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">academic philosophers uh so the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">who comment on my blog</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">are philosophy professors philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">grad students and you know some other</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">happen to have to be interested and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2">you think these people</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">are training to be basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:25.760" style="s2">professional disagreers they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">be great at it</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.760" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">and and i will say like they&#39;re better</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">average but still i think if you you</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:33.440" style="s2">know it&#39;s my site so i&#39;m gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.440" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">have a better opinion of it than others</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.720" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">but but my critics like people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">like my site</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">will say that the comments are bad</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">comments are terrible</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">uh and it becomes and sometimes i agree</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">but like uh you know it&#39;s so even with</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">people who are well trained but okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">nonetheless i&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">and i could try harder in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:58.960" style="s2">but i&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">set out a mentality for</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.960" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">commenters and this is how i initially</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">did it it&#39;s a ra rather than set up some</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">you know a whole list of rules i said</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">this imagine that you are in a room</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">with people you like</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">and you&#39;re seated at a comfortable in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">comfortable chair and a beautiful table</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">with a beautiful view</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">with your favorite drink in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:21.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve come there to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.119" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">controversial issues</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:26.079" style="s2">with people you like with along with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">kid</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.079" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">who you&#39;re teaching about how to talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">about you know this is how</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">you&#39;re with a kid who you want to model</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">good behavior for right</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">so you&#39;re comfortable your shoes are off</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">just put yourself in this mindset so i</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">just wanted people to relax</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">and just chill out and enjoy a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">and i think that helps for like a month</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">or two or six months i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">but this blog&#39;s been around for six</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">years now and i think it&#39;s worn off to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">some extent i have to go up some new</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:55.599" style="s2">trick</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:55.599" style="s2">right to get people in there but um</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s been nice about</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">kovitt of course is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">being able to interact with a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">range of strangers</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">in a format where you can see their</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:10.319" style="s2">faces and it&#39;s much harder to be snarky</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">in a context like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.319" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">right it&#39;s much harder to get like one</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">line off and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">and think that you&#39;ve triumphed in some</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">way right</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">and then everyone&#39;s thought like what a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">jerk you know so</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">uh maybe like more technology right</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:27.200" style="s2">along these lines more interactive</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">technology is the way to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.200" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">uh where we can again see more of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">and not insulate ourselves from each</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">thanks that&#39;s interesting all right uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:41.280" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">we can sneak in one or two more</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.280" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">elf you had a question i believe</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">yep elf</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">hi justin uh my question is around</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">uh i&#39;m trying to disagree well like two</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">things i&#39;ve come across are having good</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have that that&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">a poison pill that&#39;s a big problem now</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">how to overcome that one</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:09.760" style="s2">and then two like a disparity uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">in developmental psychology levels</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.760" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">depending on whatever model you want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">use but</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:17.520" style="s2">the morals uh eq</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">the the cognitive complexity and like</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.520" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">how does someone that&#39;s metasystemic try</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.280" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">to deal with someone that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">draw that linear line in the sand</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">so how can we disagree well especially</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">if most disagreements can&#39;t even be</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">resolved</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">right so i i do think that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">the success of a disagreement is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">its resolution right it&#39;s not coming to</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">and i guess that&#39;s why i started with</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">the comments that i did</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">i uh look for practical purposes</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">sometimes we need to get on the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">page to do something like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">figure out which restaurant we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">to do for dinner</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">so okay yeah so sometimes we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">agree but like</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">so i i shouldn&#39;t be too grandiose in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">proclamations about the point of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">you know sometimes we do need to agree</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">but um so</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">so that said like so you the question if</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">i answer your question correctly</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with someone who uh who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">just their way of being in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">is very different from your own like</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">their their goals of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">are different their</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">capacity for engaging in it is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">um so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not sure i have any like</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">well-formed thoughts about that except</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">it does put me in the mind of sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">when when you&#39;re a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">you have very different students uh</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">and what what i find is is that that can</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">often be a learning experience for me i</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">mean i know how to deal with certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">kinds of people</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:09.760" style="s2">along the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">and even to this day i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.760" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">encountering people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.280" style="s2">i just don&#39;t understand how they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">college for example or</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.280" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">i understand how they and not</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">necessarily because of a lack of skill</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">but like how did they make it given all</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:21.839" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">stuff that was going on in their life</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.839" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">you know like sometimes that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">explanation you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">i think that you know you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.359" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">out of disagreement what you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">convincing someone else to your side</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not going to even be</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">learning something substantively new but</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">maybe what will be is</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">learning how to present ideas that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">care about to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:54.079" style="s2">just so alien to you uh and how would</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.079" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">how would you go about doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just practice at that i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">you got to see what you can the value</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">you can take out of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">but even if it&#39;s completely i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t find that then i would just</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">don&#39;t you know just say i am i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">to take today off</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">i i think you&#39;re right justin&#39;s practice</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">i was hoping you had some</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">insight porn for me but uh i think you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">really got to know your [ __ ] to break it</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:19.599" style="s2">down simplicity to communicate it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.599" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">also to meet them where they&#39;re at like</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">it&#39;s this extra step</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s just extreme skill but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.640" style="s2">i really like the phrase inside porn by</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">the way um</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">so christian uh has a question i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">to read it on his behalf</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">as a modern analog to the trickster who</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">breaks up norms to prevent calcification</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">and makes space for innovation does the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">troll</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">have a healthy function in a society</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">where people can get completely absorbed</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">in their reality tunnels and conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">ideas feelings behaviors and could there</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">be a way to make trolling more</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">efficacious in this regard</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:58.839" style="s2">rather than being done in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:53:01.520" style="s2">mean-spirited way a quote-unquote sacred</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.839" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">troll</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.520" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">so i guess my my answer is it&#39;s yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">that&#39;s reluctantly in a way because as</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">someone who moderates a forum</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">i have to deal with trolls and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">great to deal with but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">that i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:22.240" style="s2">to recognize is that there</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">there are benefits to different forms</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.240" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">of conversational participation</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">they just they play different roles and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s valuable to have those</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">roles</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.559" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">you have to in a way kind of do a cost</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">benefit analysis some forms of trolling</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:38.720" style="s2">are just more destructive and annoying</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:39.599" style="s2">than given the aims of the particular</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">forum</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.599" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">or the aims of the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">you&#39;re engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">so i will say</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">yes to the big question controls be</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">useful yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">what does that tell us about any</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">specific troll in any particular context</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:58.880" style="s2">not a whole lot we need to sort of do a</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">way the benefits and burdens</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.880" end="00:54:02.000" style="s2">there but do so in an open-minded way i</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">think to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.000" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">the trolling might be might be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">and just</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">you know keep it open as a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">even if you ultimately decide that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">as for productive forms of trolling we</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">already i think we already have that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">in existence it just doesn&#39;t appear to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:17.280" style="s2">us we might not call it when i call it</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">trolling because it</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.280" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">it steps up you know it&#39;s uh it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">about whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">uh some view and this person has access</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.839" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">to some article that has some empirical</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">information that completely undercuts</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">their position</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">and he&#39;s like ha ha boom right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.760" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">that&#39;s in a way</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">he&#39;s doing it to troll but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:40.559" style="s2">doing it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">actually is substantively informative</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.559" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">low and behold we have some helpful</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">trolling</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">there um you know some of it might come</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">down to the moderators to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">the trolls to be more helpful in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">regard</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">was socrates a troll</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">no i don&#39;t think so um</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">you know part of part of the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">problem well so</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">so most of the time socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:16.079" style="s2">interacting with people who wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">hang out with him</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.079" end="00:55:18.480" style="s2">right not always right sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">stop someone on the street they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:21.119" style="s2">trying to settle away</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">but most of the time he&#39;s talking to</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.119" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">people who want to hang out with him and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">that&#39;s one difference between the troll</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:29.520" style="s2">socrates right but usually the troll is</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:29.520" style="s2">not wanted</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:34.559" style="s2">so all right</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">so we&#39;re approaching the end of the hour</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">an opportunity to kind of any concluding</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">thoughts i know questions we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:42.000" style="s2">from you from</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">all all corners which is which is what</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.000" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">this though is about</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:46.480" style="s2">but yeah any kind of summarizing</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">thoughts well i</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.480" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">i think that you know for me uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot for me to learn still</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">about this right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">one of the things we didn&#39;t get to talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">about today was some of the writing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">peter himself has done</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">on specific ways we might improve</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">conversational context and uh he</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">in fact has done a lot of detailed work</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">on the nature of various different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">of groups so i&#39;m kind of sorry that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">talk more about your taxonomies and your</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">strategies there so maybe hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">since this is your form you get to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:21.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">uh at other times i will say like if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">just trying to get you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:28.839" style="s2">one thing across uh it would well like</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.319" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">i&#39;m not gonna be just one thing but</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.839" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">uh one of the things i try to teach my</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">is just how much more complicated all</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">the issues they care about</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">are how much more complicated they are</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:40.720" style="s2">than they&#39;re presented to</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">uh presented by the media by politicians</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.720" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">by the authorities in their lives right</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:45.520" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the great joys of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">to leave students with more questions at</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.520" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">the end of the class about a subject</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">than they came in with right so they can</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:54.960" style="s2">just see how complicated things are</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">and i think recognition of complication</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.960" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">is one kind of ingredient for better</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">right for more honest disagreement for a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:06.559" style="s2">kind of epistemic modesty</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">that might just</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.559" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">uh cause us to be less</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:14.079" style="s2">less oriented towards winning and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.799" end="00:57:17.680" style="s2">oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.079" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">understanding but that said sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:20.480" style="s2">you know when people are arranged</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:22.160" style="s2">towards winning and they push really</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.480" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">hard and it&#39;s annoying</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.160" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">it still can be something we learn from</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">so i think the other point is just</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:27.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of behavior we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:29.440" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:31.040" style="s2">lots of people we don&#39;t like interacting</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.440" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">with ways in which disagreements go</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.040" end="00:57:33.359" style="s2">badly</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.920" end="00:57:35.200" style="s2">and to the best of our ability we should</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">try to see what we can learn from those</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.200" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">people and those experiences too</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s what kind of the stow</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:44.520" style="s2">is in service towards is building a good</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">relationship with like</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.520" end="00:57:49.520" style="s2">unknowingness in general and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:51.200" style="s2">holding this complexity uh with while</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">not collapsing to one sort of memetic</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.200" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">driver or reality tunnel or whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">so that being said i&#39;ll make some</p>
