<p begin="00:02:27.810" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">really nice to see actually quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:36.390" style="s2">familiar faces and familiar names in all</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">places as well so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.390" end="00:02:41.640" style="s2">really nice yeah it actually might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:44.610" style="s2">useful just to see a show of hands who</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.640" end="00:02:46.739" style="s2">either had a chance to read the article</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.610" end="00:02:48.830" style="s2">or see the film that we put out at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.739" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.830" end="00:02:54.209" style="s2">cool okay I&#39;ll do a brief brief summary</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">in any case because I think well we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.209" end="00:02:57.440" style="s2">use that as a kind of springboard and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">then then just have an open conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:03:05.810" style="s2">so the suppose that the reason for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:08.549" style="s2">article and the film was this curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.810" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">around its phrase that kept coming up</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.549" end="00:03:14.670" style="s2">and that I think a lot of people feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:17.069" style="s2">which is this idea of being between what</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.670" end="00:03:20.850" style="s2">zaxxon calls being between two worlds or</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.069" end="00:03:23.480" style="s2">being in the liminal and I&#39;ve used this</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.850" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">metaphor a few times of the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.480" end="00:03:28.170" style="s2">myself and also I really loved the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">etymology of it where the word comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.170" end="00:03:33.299" style="s2">from because it uh come well close to my</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">heart in some ways because Lehman in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.299" end="00:03:38.250" style="s2">Latin is threshold it&#39;s kind of the edge</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">of things and where I grew up actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.250" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">in in Germany was very close to you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:46.859" style="s2">a five minute walk from the Lehman that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:48.510" style="s2">which was the wall that divided the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.859" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">Roman Empire from the Germanic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">and so I always had that in my head you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:55.049" style="s2">know and you could go and walk the wall</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:58.049" style="s2">and this is very kind of visceral</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.049" end="00:03:59.220" style="s2">visible touchable boundary that was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.049" end="00:04:01.709" style="s2">boundary between two completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.220" end="00:04:05.010" style="s2">different worlds and when you step</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.709" end="00:04:06.989" style="s2">through the threshold that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.010" end="00:04:09.269" style="s2">you know that word threshold comes from</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.989" end="00:04:11.850" style="s2">our word for doorway so if the Old</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.269" end="00:04:12.989" style="s2">English for doorway and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.850" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done we&#39;ve stepped through</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.989" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">our doorways into our homes into this</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:22.430" style="s2">completely other world and like it often</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:24.289" style="s2">is in mythology the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.430" end="00:04:26.570" style="s2">can look very much like the world you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.289" end="00:04:29.570" style="s2">come from but be completely different</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.570" end="00:04:30.500" style="s2">and the rules that used to apply no</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.570" end="00:04:31.910" style="s2">longer apply</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.500" end="00:04:34.490" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an experience that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.910" end="00:04:38.060" style="s2">certainly have in this during this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.490" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">crisis and I&#39;m you know actually from</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.060" end="00:04:42.440" style="s2">conversations with Peter this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:44.060" style="s2">the liminal war also really you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.440" end="00:04:46.310" style="s2">which was an idea I heard from Peter</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.060" end="00:04:49.130" style="s2">like that really kind of got me thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.310" end="00:04:51.169" style="s2">as well you know this is a it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.130" end="00:04:54.650" style="s2">a space we&#39;re in but it&#39;s a space where</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.169" end="00:04:58.910" style="s2">we&#39;re really in some way potentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.650" end="00:05:00.620" style="s2">gonna be battling for the for the kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.910" end="00:05:02.210" style="s2">of people we&#39;re gonna be in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.620" end="00:05:04.490" style="s2">society and the kind of culture we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.210" end="00:05:06.460" style="s2">gonna have forgetting about where we</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.490" end="00:05:08.690" style="s2">might go for a moment because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.460" end="00:05:13.000" style="s2">really difficult to tell in the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.690" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">you know the the kind of idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.000" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">direction becomes very different when</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.490" end="00:05:21.650" style="s2">you&#39;re in what in in myth is very often</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:22.729" style="s2">an underworld so that&#39;s why the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.650" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">title was called Traverse in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.729" end="00:05:27.110" style="s2">underworld because one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">potent symbols of the liminal is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.110" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">underworld is this place where I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:38.539" style="s2">often a hero or in the case of Demeter</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.690" end="00:05:40.610" style="s2">and Persephone a goddess might have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.539" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">travel down into the underworld to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.610" end="00:05:44.840" style="s2">rescue someone or to go through some</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:47.930" style="s2">kind of front deep transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.840" end="00:05:49.909" style="s2">come out and as one of the people I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.930" end="00:05:51.949" style="s2">interviewed for the article said</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.909" end="00:05:53.210" style="s2">Charlotte McCann she was like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.949" end="00:05:55.729" style="s2">really easy to get into the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.210" end="00:05:57.289" style="s2">because all you have to do is die and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.729" end="00:05:59.530" style="s2">were you know in mythic terms you could</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.289" end="00:06:02.870" style="s2">say that we&#39;ve all been in some way</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.530" end="00:06:04.789" style="s2">transported into an underworld or in</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.870" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">Celtic mythology was often an Otherworld</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.789" end="00:06:14.270" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of right beside or between</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:15.979" style="s2">our world and once were in that while it</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.270" end="00:06:17.509" style="s2">might be easy to get in there and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.979" end="00:06:20.180" style="s2">can almost fall in there accidentally as</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.509" end="00:06:22.190" style="s2">does happen in some stories it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.180" end="00:06:26.509" style="s2">difficult to get out and it requires</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.190" end="00:06:30.490" style="s2">certain qualities of a character in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.509" end="00:06:30.490" style="s2">story or a myth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.200" end="00:06:36.780" style="s2">that include resilience perseverance</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.800" end="00:06:40.200" style="s2">kind of often a good heart is a big part</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.780" end="00:06:45.210" style="s2">of it just a kind of sense of integrity</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.200" end="00:06:46.950" style="s2">and clear and clean purpose and so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:48.060" style="s2">really calls to me because I think you</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.950" end="00:06:50.190" style="s2">know big part of what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.060" end="00:06:52.140" style="s2">exploring with rebel wisdom is what are</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.190" end="00:06:54.840" style="s2">the practices and what are the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.140" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">being that will help us to be the kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.840" end="00:07:01.650" style="s2">of people we might need to be to thrive</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:03.030" style="s2">in the environment we&#39;re in and the kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.650" end="00:07:05.910" style="s2">of people that we might have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.030" end="00:07:08.270" style="s2">trained to be might not be fit for</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.910" end="00:07:10.440" style="s2">purpose and we might be cold now into</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.270" end="00:07:13.500" style="s2">another very mythic term which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.440" end="00:07:16.530" style="s2">initiation to initiate into a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.500" end="00:07:19.230" style="s2">being and so that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.530" end="00:07:22.740" style="s2">themes I was exploring the article yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.230" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">but I also spoke to a kind of a hero of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.740" end="00:07:27.150" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:28.200" style="s2">Steven Jenkinson who is Canadian I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.150" end="00:07:30.120" style="s2">he&#39;s been on this I think he&#39;s been on</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.200" end="00:07:32.640" style="s2">the stove if I&#39;m correct yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.120" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">certainly Peter spoke to him earlier</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.640" end="00:07:38.640" style="s2">yeah interviewed him yeah interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:41.130" style="s2">him yeah so yeah and hid you know he is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.640" end="00:07:43.950" style="s2">holding some very deep wisdom in my view</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.130" end="00:07:47.310" style="s2">and he was a palliative care counsellor</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.950" end="00:07:49.320" style="s2">for many years sat with many thousand</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.310" end="00:07:51.540" style="s2">people as they died and then wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.320" end="00:07:53.190" style="s2">book called die wise it was featured in</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.540" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2">a great documentary called grief Walker</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.190" end="00:07:59.250" style="s2">which was on a Canadian TV station and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.520" end="00:08:02.070" style="s2">his what I really found fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.250" end="00:08:05.430" style="s2">about his perspective is how he talks</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.070" end="00:08:06.990" style="s2">about our cultures not only our</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.430" end="00:08:09.660" style="s2">inability to have a healthy relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.990" end="00:08:12.120" style="s2">with death and what that actually means</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.660" end="00:08:14.730" style="s2">I wanted me to die well but also our</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.120" end="00:08:16.110" style="s2">inability to talk about endings I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.730" end="00:08:17.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a really key point I want to pull</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.110" end="00:08:20.220" style="s2">out in this intro as well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.630" end="00:08:21.750" style="s2">because that was kind of a real shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.220" end="00:08:23.850" style="s2">for me because I&#39;m the product of my own</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.750" end="00:08:27.000" style="s2">culture and that you know we talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.850" end="00:08:29.700" style="s2">about transition or someone passed on or</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.000" end="00:08:32.820" style="s2">transition or like a phase shift or all</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.700" end="00:08:36.660" style="s2">these different things and we don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.820" end="00:08:40.950" style="s2">really talk about endings and in order</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.660" end="00:08:43.470" style="s2">to allow something to die like a culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.950" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t working and various systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.470" end="00:08:47.740" style="s2">that were</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:49.210" style="s2">are too fragile to ever be sustained we</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.740" end="00:08:55.320" style="s2">also have to talk about endings and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.210" end="00:08:58.029" style="s2">that&#39;s really key and yeah so him</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.320" end="00:09:00.760" style="s2">charlotte de kan is featured in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.029" end="00:09:03.940" style="s2">article she talks about as well another</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.760" end="00:09:05.980" style="s2">key point which is that there is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.940" end="00:09:10.360" style="s2">famously the hero&#39;s journey in mythology</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.980" end="00:09:13.240" style="s2">so this process where for example you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.360" end="00:09:15.220" style="s2">know Frodo is really comfortable in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.240" end="00:09:16.420" style="s2">state disco and the Shire in a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.220" end="00:09:19.630" style="s2">safe place and then he has a call to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.420" end="00:09:21.700" style="s2">adventure and Gandalf who tells him to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.630" end="00:09:24.460" style="s2">to come on this kind of grand adventure</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.700" end="00:09:26.170" style="s2">to dispose of this ring and then he</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.460" end="00:09:28.120" style="s2">steps past his comfort zone and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.170" end="00:09:30.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a process of passing the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.120" end="00:09:31.750" style="s2">threshold which actually in the film</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.670" end="00:09:33.970" style="s2">Lord of the Rings</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.750" end="00:09:36.130" style="s2">is a really visceral moment it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.970" end="00:09:39.160" style="s2">a bit where Sam and Frodo are walking</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.130" end="00:09:41.380" style="s2">and Sam suddenly stops and he says if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.160" end="00:09:43.570" style="s2">take one more step it&#39;ll be the furthest</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.380" end="00:09:45.160" style="s2">away from home I&#39;ve ever been I&#39;m that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.570" end="00:09:47.950" style="s2">passing the first threshold so he takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.160" end="00:09:50.170" style="s2">that step obviously and then once they</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.950" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">do that they go through various</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.170" end="00:09:56.410" style="s2">challenges and their characteristic the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:59.860" style="s2">result is tested their friendship is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.410" end="00:10:01.180" style="s2">tested and that is the very often the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.860" end="00:10:02.470" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey there is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.180" end="00:10:04.780" style="s2">going into the cave going to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.470" end="00:10:07.060" style="s2">underworld slaying the dragon coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.780" end="00:10:10.030" style="s2">back to the community with the gold and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.060" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">this process in in myth and in the study</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.030" end="00:10:13.060" style="s2">of myth there&#39;s something called the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:15.010" style="s2">monomyth the idea that we actually are</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.060" end="00:10:17.500" style="s2">only really telling one story and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.010" end="00:10:19.930" style="s2">story of an individual&#39;s process from</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.500" end="00:10:21.970" style="s2">going from immaturity to maturity from</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.930" end="00:10:24.100" style="s2">less awareness to more awareness from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.970" end="00:10:26.530" style="s2">small view of just safe in your comfort</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.100" end="00:10:28.360" style="s2">zone to a more expansive world centric</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.530" end="00:10:30.339" style="s2">view where you have a role in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.360" end="00:10:33.990" style="s2">community and you have a purpose in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.339" end="00:10:37.270" style="s2">world so what was interesting talking to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.990" end="00:10:39.280" style="s2">Charlotte Charlotte diccon was actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.270" end="00:10:40.810" style="s2">pointed out that there&#39;s a very there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.280" end="00:10:43.779" style="s2">a very different female initiation</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.810" end="00:10:46.150" style="s2">journey as well which is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.779" end="00:10:49.330" style="s2">inverse of that where you start from</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.150" end="00:10:51.970" style="s2">being a princess and you start in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.330" end="00:10:54.100" style="s2">of and in the place where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.970" end="00:10:56.960" style="s2">elevated and then you go in a process</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.100" end="00:10:59.180" style="s2">where you are pulled down</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.960" end="00:11:01.220" style="s2">is kind of stripping away of all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.180" end="00:11:05.150" style="s2">finery and all the things that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.220" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">really you and then you&#39;re down in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.150" end="00:11:10.010" style="s2">in the ashes in doing what she calls</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:12.260" style="s2">kitchen work there&#39;s this process of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.010" end="00:11:14.810" style="s2">being humbled and going down back into</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.260" end="00:11:17.840" style="s2">the earth and back into a deeper deeper</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.810" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">connection and yet it requires of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.840" end="00:11:23.930" style="s2">all of those same qualities of resolve</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:26.750" style="s2">determination a true heart compassion</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.930" end="00:11:29.560" style="s2">care for others and in that process of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.750" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">going down rather than going outwards</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.560" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a transformation and so my</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:37.430" style="s2">feeling right now is that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:39.980" style="s2">going through doesn&#39;t feel to me like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.430" end="00:11:41.480" style="s2">male initiatory journey as much as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.980" end="00:11:42.980" style="s2">love that process and in fact Peters</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.480" end="00:11:44.300" style="s2">been in our men&#39;s weekend and we use the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.980" end="00:11:45.470" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey as like that the way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.300" end="00:11:48.260" style="s2">guide the whole process</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.470" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">I in some ways live my life with a deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.260" end="00:11:53.930" style="s2">connection to that that initiatory</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:55.100" style="s2">journey and so very different yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.930" end="00:11:56.150" style="s2">is that&#39;s a really good point from</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.100" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">Jordan that is a lot like Pan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.150" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">Labyrinth actually so yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:05.690" style="s2">process of coming down rather than going</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">out in this grand adventure like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.690" end="00:12:08.720" style="s2">feel like and this was a thought I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:10.550" style="s2">kind of before writing the article it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:11.930" style="s2">like I really don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.550" end="00:12:13.160" style="s2">called into a grand adventure I feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.930" end="00:12:14.930" style="s2">like I&#39;m being called to something else</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:16.910" style="s2">like where am I gonna go I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.930" end="00:12:18.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;ve been on like a grand</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.910" end="00:12:20.300" style="s2">adventure in some ways and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.440" end="00:12:21.320" style="s2">trying to achieve and and doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.300" end="00:12:23.390" style="s2">and like that&#39;s great there something</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.320" end="00:12:26.390" style="s2">wrong with that that&#39;s that&#39;s one half</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.390" end="00:12:28.610" style="s2">of the process I think um or of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.390" end="00:12:30.530" style="s2">potential process but right now it feels</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.610" end="00:12:32.660" style="s2">very much more like what what Charlotte</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.530" end="00:12:35.930" style="s2">McCann is pointing out of this going</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.660" end="00:12:38.300" style="s2">down into the darkness into the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.930" end="00:12:40.100" style="s2">humor so she called it humorous meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.300" end="00:12:41.620" style="s2">the earth the ground which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.100" end="00:12:43.550" style="s2">where we get the word humility from and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.620" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">potentially the word human interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.550" end="00:12:48.730" style="s2">a little bit more of a roundabout</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:53.840" style="s2">etymology to it but all these lovely</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.730" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">signs and nods in our language I really</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.840" end="00:12:59.060" style="s2">love to follow so that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:03.140" style="s2">process I think that&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.060" end="00:13:04.730" style="s2">general gist of what the film and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.140" end="00:13:07.850" style="s2">article are about and some of the themes</p>
