<p begin="00:00:04.680" end="00:00:09.179" style="s2">cafe where we are discussing what are</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.230" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">your thoughts and feelings on communism</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.179" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">or Marxism or both if you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:17.340" style="s2">both so if anyone would like to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">there are three of us so I will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.340" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">participating and I can go first if no</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:26.039" style="s2">one else wants to and I&#39;ll also be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:27.859" style="s2">timekeeper awesome thank you thanks for</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:37.710" style="s2">so this is what are my feelings and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">story I wrote notes on the Adina cafe</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.710" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">and rule Mego it not on this as I try to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">just speak from the heart I think that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:48.149" style="s2">there is a lot of really amazing parts</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:49.829" style="s2">to communism and Marxism I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.149" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">why in has stuck around is an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:54.600" style="s2">that there is a lot of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:56.219" style="s2">beautiful about coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">working as a group for the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.219" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">the group I also think when it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">implemented in the actual real world our</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">human there&#39;s been some some there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">been huge downfalls there has been mass</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">murder and there&#39;s a lot of repression</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">that happens when you want a group of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">people to do a thing especially when</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">you&#39;re not acknowledging that that group</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">of people it&#39;s made up of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:21.150" style="s2">and have their own autonomous beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">and when you have a central authority</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.150" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">that is theoretically supposed to at one</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:27.869" style="s2">point give up power but I think human</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:30.509" style="s2">nature is when you have power you want</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.869" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">to hold on to it I think the words</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.509" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">communism and Marxism both get</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">interchanged even in my mind for sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a lot I mean I live in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:41.700" style="s2">an I think a fairly socialist country</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:43.470" style="s2">Canada and I think it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">benefit because of the socialism part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:48.450" style="s2">it I love having universal health care</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">I like I&#39;ve experienced universal</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.450" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">healthcare and didn&#39;t have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">declare bankruptcy because of having</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">brain surgery twice and radiation and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">think that throwing the baby out with</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">the bathwater saying that like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">have with there&#39;s nothing they miss</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">value in communism and Marxism is as bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">as saying there is whatever the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">of that is that we have to follow at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">letter to the law right like it has to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:17.190" style="s2">be followed</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:20.880" style="s2">as it is as it was set out by Karl Marx</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">um I think that for a lot of things not</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.880" end="00:02:27.860" style="s2">just a Marxism we tend to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">person who came up with it as gospel</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.860" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">instead of honoring that they weren&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">this time period they do it with Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">and the theory of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:37.830" style="s2">definitely with with Karl Marx and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.870" style="s2">communism of like well this is how it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.830" end="00:02:41.580" style="s2">has to be and then both they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.870" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">simultaneously this is with it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.580" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">been implemented and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:47.970" style="s2">implement it exactly and none of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">people knew what we know now I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.970" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">Darwin didn&#39;t know genetics which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:55.860" style="s2">huge part of you know evolution and Karl</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:58.200" style="s2">Marx didn&#39;t know well this entire</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.860" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">century didn&#39;t know what happened during</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.200" end="00:03:04.920" style="s2">World War Two didn&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">Internet technology the the global world</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.920" end="00:03:15.330" style="s2">that we now live in I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">lot of a benefit to finding what works</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.330" end="00:03:19.890" style="s2">in all of the things we have done in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.720" style="s2">past and honor that we have to move</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.890" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">forward with nothing we&#39;ve done in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.720" end="00:03:25.350" style="s2">past meeting there has to be a new way a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.570" style="s2">new way that isn&#39;t moving backwards and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.350" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">is moving forwards and I think whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.570" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">that way is has to honor our individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">autonomy that we all have our own</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:37.709" style="s2">decisions around our own space in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">society which capitalism pretends to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.709" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think does a great job of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:42.810" style="s2">because it&#39;s participate or starve</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:44.549" style="s2">communism definitely doesn&#39;t do a good</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">job of and under where it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.549" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">implemented or its kind of assigns you</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">what you&#39;re supposed to be and at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:53.640" style="s2">same time we have to honor our group</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.030" end="00:03:55.560" style="s2">involvement how to have our autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.640" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">groups that hopefully are our choice to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.560" end="00:03:59.700" style="s2">be part of and that there&#39;s a space for</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">everyone and so what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.700" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">create in the world is very much I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">believe a mixture of the best parts of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:08.459" style="s2">what we have had in the past went from</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:11.340" style="s2">tribalism all the way through to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.459" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">capitalism including absolutism and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.340" end="00:04:17.789" style="s2">I&#39;m going to stop there and I forgot to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:19.289" style="s2">mute everyone else who I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.789" end="00:04:20.519" style="s2">because I do what Brett was doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.289" end="00:04:22.289" style="s2">that&#39;s about what I&#39;m talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.519" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">yeah of course but it says ramune it so</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.289" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not because of the technology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:33.250" style="s2">like yeah yeah yeah technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:36.490" style="s2">and so uh anyone to go first next who</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.250" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">will go next you know I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.490" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">add an input maybe well you can go if</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:48.669" style="s2">you would like to go sure I&#39;ll go I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:52.750" style="s2">just say that I think I agree with 100</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.669" end="00:04:56.889" style="s2">percent of your signal or 99 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.750" end="00:04:58.660" style="s2">your signal and it&#39;s very reasonable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.889" end="00:05:00.940" style="s2">I would I would add that I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.660" end="00:05:03.940" style="s2">stipulate that Marx didn&#39;t know very</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.940" end="00:05:06.159" style="s2">much about the the new dogma of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.940" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">scientism he although he was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.159" end="00:05:10.509" style="s2">materialist he was more of a in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:13.630" style="s2">Ken Wilber he was a lower right</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.509" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">reductionist so he didn&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.630" end="00:05:19.060" style="s2">full complexity of reality so but we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:21.130" style="s2">have to we have to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.060" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">within a broader context of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.130" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">mind body culture and society and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:30.220" style="s2">and in the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">I think Marx is my new secure tool but</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.220" end="00:05:34.719" style="s2">his philosophy is what remains with us</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:38.050" style="s2">to this day and so we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.719" end="00:05:41.229" style="s2">the kind of philosophical remnants of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.050" end="00:05:43.900" style="s2">what you either call neo Marxism or some</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.229" end="00:05:48.580" style="s2">other field of speculative inquiry so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.900" end="00:05:50.949" style="s2">but but the point is that the point is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.580" end="00:05:53.530" style="s2">that Marx is not just some person we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.949" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">cast aside in the name of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.530" end="00:05:57.969" style="s2">libertarian ideology</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:06:00.659" style="s2">although libertarianism is needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.969" end="00:06:04.030" style="s2">included within this new social</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.659" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">theoretical metamodel but that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.030" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">starting point but how we can include</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:11.880" style="s2">diverse perspectives within our you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:15.009" style="s2">trans libertarianism and transhumanism</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.880" end="00:06:16.419" style="s2">along with trans Marxism and combine</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.009" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">these all together into kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.419" end="00:06:22.539" style="s2">unified identity that&#39;s diverse and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:27.729" style="s2">unique and proliferate as</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.539" end="00:06:30.219" style="s2">multi-dimensional as it is coherent and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.729" end="00:06:33.550" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of my idea for a system that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.219" end="00:06:38.370" style="s2">we can use so if that makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.550" end="00:06:38.370" style="s2">anybody I hope that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.900" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">just kind of an inroad into where we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.090" end="00:06:47.539" style="s2">go with this into the future hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:52.770" style="s2">to to go in any direction we choose so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.539" end="00:06:55.919" style="s2">thank you all right thank you Brett from</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.770" end="00:06:58.350" style="s2">Z would you like to share sure I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.919" end="00:07:00.810" style="s2">prepare any five-minute speech on this I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.350" end="00:07:02.490" style="s2">just wanted to enter into the room you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.810" end="00:07:05.610" style="s2">know just to have a general conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.490" end="00:07:07.770" style="s2">about the topic for sure um I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.610" end="00:07:11.910" style="s2">view I&#39;m thinking that Marxism in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.770" end="00:07:14.310" style="s2">communism is kind of the path that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.910" end="00:07:16.199" style="s2">are on with game B I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.310" end="00:07:18.419" style="s2">socialism in the late 19th century early</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.199" end="00:07:20.250" style="s2">20th century was very much</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.419" end="00:07:22.620" style="s2">you know the idea of socialism very much</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.250" end="00:07:25.770" style="s2">similar to the game B group that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.620" end="00:07:28.440" style="s2">today we&#39;re more or less continuing on</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.770" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">the same path that those guys began and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.440" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">with new or better information obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:36.120" style="s2">but I feel like you know what&#39;s weird is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.150" end="00:07:39.419" style="s2">in the last 50 years that there has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.120" end="00:07:42.570" style="s2">almost no development or conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.419" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">this realm because it was assumed or at</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.570" end="00:07:46.680" style="s2">least portrayed as if guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:48.030" style="s2">there&#39;s no other better system</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.680" end="00:07:50.310" style="s2">capitalism is the best we&#39;re ever gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.030" end="00:07:53.880" style="s2">do so let&#39;s just try to make it work and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.310" end="00:07:57.419" style="s2">do whatever we can and so I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.880" end="00:08:00.150" style="s2">there&#39;s we&#39;ve lost a massive opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.419" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">to to make things better than the last</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.150" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">50 years because we ignored you know all</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:09.419" style="s2">of that and we and and I think society</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:11.669" style="s2">began to just produce too much and go</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.419" end="00:08:15.479" style="s2">down this capitalist path where where</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.669" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">where we&#39;re at now but so in implement I</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.479" end="00:08:22.199" style="s2">mean I guess I would say that Marxism is</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:24.360" style="s2">is essentially more theory theory and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.199" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">philosophy than actual implementation</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.360" end="00:08:30.360" style="s2">and the idea that you know the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.510" style="s2">production the material the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.360" end="00:08:34.830" style="s2">production and the socio-economic system</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.510" end="00:08:37.860" style="s2">you know it kind of relates to how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.830" end="00:08:41.190" style="s2">materialist old functions in and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.860" end="00:08:44.700" style="s2">societies function is is excellent is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.190" end="00:08:47.250" style="s2">good you know reality but you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.700" end="00:08:50.070" style="s2">obviously the socio-economic system that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.250" end="00:08:52.200" style="s2">we have dictates and the governance</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.070" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">structure dictates the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.200" end="00:08:57.450" style="s2">and so the you know the Communists in</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">that you know in a hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.450" end="00:09:00.060" style="s2">when the Russia tried to do it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:01.590" style="s2">they had different challenges that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.060" end="00:09:04.260" style="s2">have today didn&#39;t have computers they</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.590" end="00:09:06.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the advancements of modes of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.260" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">production that we have today so they</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.270" end="00:09:12.090" style="s2">couldn&#39;t implement it in in a manner in</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.890" style="s2">which it could have been implemented to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.090" end="00:09:16.860" style="s2">say today so they&#39;re not all hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.890" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">percent wrong but they still I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.860" end="00:09:20.970" style="s2">they&#39;re still missing something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:22.710" style="s2">they&#39;re what&#39;s more interesting for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.970" end="00:09:25.110" style="s2">is to look at how they&#39;re the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.710" end="00:09:27.660" style="s2">like what did Russia do what did all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.110" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">these so-called communist countries have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.660" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">the same rather than different and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:35.430" style="s2">thing that was the same is the money the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">money itself was physical property and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.430" end="00:09:41.240" style="s2">so you you you controlled the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:44.460" style="s2">production you know the resources land</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.240" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">the labor and you comment and you made</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.460" end="00:09:48.600" style="s2">that the communal ownership but what</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:50.730" style="s2">about the money the money itself became</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.600" end="00:09:52.620" style="s2">a physical property which is in relation</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.730" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">to the physical world to the you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.620" end="00:09:58.200" style="s2">the outcome with the production so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:10:00.300" style="s2">think that&#39;s really the key um and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.200" end="00:10:02.070" style="s2">piece is something that has never been</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.300" end="00:10:05.510" style="s2">tried and that piece is something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.070" end="00:10:07.950" style="s2">was never possible until today because a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.510" end="00:10:09.570" style="s2">currency if you know the purpose of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.950" end="00:10:11.940" style="s2">currency is to have a unit of exchange</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.570" end="00:10:14.070" style="s2">to be able to exchange stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.940" end="00:10:16.740" style="s2">and use pricing system to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.070" end="00:10:18.210" style="s2">that and so you had to have something</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.740" end="00:10:20.130" style="s2">that was physical because I didn&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.210" end="00:10:22.200" style="s2">you if I went out on my community and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.130" end="00:10:24.690" style="s2">traded with people I didn&#39;t trust I had</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.200" end="00:10:26.220" style="s2">to trust the currency and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.690" end="00:10:28.020" style="s2">we ended up you know coming to gold</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.220" end="00:10:34.530" style="s2">because gold had those features of of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.020" end="00:10:37.380" style="s2">trust you know of weight of carats etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.530" end="00:10:39.840" style="s2">that we knew that I didn&#39;t trust Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.380" end="00:10:42.900" style="s2">to honor her commitments but I knew the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.840" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">valid the value of the gold so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.900" end="00:10:47.280" style="s2">anyway so here we are today</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:48.900" style="s2">but we&#39;re still using this currency as</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.280" end="00:10:51.240" style="s2">if it&#39;s a physical piece of property but</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.900" end="00:10:53.730" style="s2">we&#39;re allowing these banks to create</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:55.080" style="s2">this currency this physical piece of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.730" end="00:10:59.310" style="s2">property that relates to the real</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.080" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">material physical world you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.310" end="00:11:04.830" style="s2">centralized way anyway so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">things I&#39;d like to do in this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.830" end="00:11:07.810" style="s2">though is I</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:10.630" style="s2">to kind of get away from this language</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.810" end="00:11:13.510" style="s2">of communism Marxism and and more or</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.630" end="00:11:15.660" style="s2">less talk about the actual pieces like</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.510" end="00:11:18.279" style="s2">for example you have land you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.660" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">production you&#39;ve got labor you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.279" end="00:11:24.100" style="s2">currency and so the more appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:26.139" style="s2">language is that if we can take this</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.100" end="00:11:29.320" style="s2">puzzle all these different pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.139" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">rearrange them and see what manner of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.320" end="00:11:35.380" style="s2">outcome we can get and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:36.970" style="s2">that&#39;s I think the fundamental area on</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.380" end="00:11:39.130" style="s2">which we need to focus and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.970" end="00:11:41.380" style="s2">focusing on the game the game be crowd</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.130" end="00:11:44.949" style="s2">right so if we get too caught up in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.380" end="00:11:46.329" style="s2">past with these labels and fighting with</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.949" end="00:11:48.970" style="s2">one another we&#39;re not going to move</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.329" end="00:11:51.220" style="s2">forward so you know some of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.970" end="00:11:53.350" style="s2">physical things exist you have land</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.220" end="00:11:55.779" style="s2">you&#39;ve got resources you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.350" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">distribution you&#39;ve got transportation</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.779" end="00:12:03.399" style="s2">you have labor so all those pieces exist</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">and then the pieces that are that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.399" end="00:12:10.120" style="s2">we created the currency can be is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:12.250" style="s2">time okay well really quickly the that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.120" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">last piece the currency piece has always</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.250" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">been the one piece that we haven&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:18.579" style="s2">we just assumed was natural and must be</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:21.420" style="s2">that way but that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.579" end="00:12:25.149" style="s2">the currency currency you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.420" end="00:12:28.540" style="s2">current to see the current the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.149" end="00:12:30.970" style="s2">of time the career I would add to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.540" end="00:12:33.130" style="s2">maybe I can add something</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.970" end="00:12:36.730" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s now open so for the next 15</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.130" end="00:12:39.990" style="s2">minutes up to 30 minutes we can go keep</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.730" end="00:12:39.990" style="s2">it a rind rule Omega</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.269" end="00:12:50.709" style="s2">yeah so omega kind of using a system of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.029" end="00:12:51.370" style="s2">just kind of honing the collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.709" end="00:12:55.149" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.370" end="00:12:59.290" style="s2">I believe Marx Marx is a collective node</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.149" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">within a greater collective multiplex if</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.290" end="00:13:04.510" style="s2">you will if I can call it a multiplex a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:08.199" style="s2">diverse multiplex of historical</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:11.050" style="s2">constellations including Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.199" end="00:13:13.149" style="s2">who in some respects he is a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.050" end="00:13:15.970" style="s2">because he believes in that determine</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.149" end="00:13:20.360" style="s2">the determinant philosophy of the south</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.970" end="00:13:22.820" style="s2">so in fact Jordan Peterson is Ammar</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.360" end="00:13:25.940" style="s2">in the sense that Hegel received his</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.820" end="00:13:27.590" style="s2">lineage from the same exact you know he</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.620" end="00:13:49.940" style="s2">is what is the determine itself has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.630" end="00:13:52.520" style="s2">has been lost throughout the historical</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.940" end="00:13:54.890" style="s2">process and so we&#39;re trying to recover</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.520" end="00:13:57.710" style="s2">Hegel&#39;s determine itself whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.890" end="00:14:00.980" style="s2">Peterson or kin Wilbur or or some other</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.710" end="00:14:02.540" style="s2">philosopher but although Martin Luther</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.980" end="00:14:05.390" style="s2">King didn&#39;t really appreciate this</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.540" end="00:14:08.230" style="s2">concept of concentrating all one&#39;s power</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.390" end="00:14:11.990" style="s2">into oneself as opposed to the multiplex</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.230" end="00:14:14.390" style="s2">however so if that makes sense so I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.990" end="00:14:17.420" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of how I was I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.390" end="00:14:20.450" style="s2">stipulate that in a sense Peterson is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.420" end="00:14:21.790" style="s2">Marxist because he believes in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.450" end="00:14:24.610" style="s2">Hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.790" end="00:14:29.380" style="s2">know the idea of the Hegelian gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.610" end="00:14:33.970" style="s2">which is the the immaterial object of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.380" end="00:14:36.380" style="s2">the purely transcendent dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.970" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">anderson considered himself a marxist i</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.380" end="00:14:41.330" style="s2">don&#39;t he doesn&#39;t consider himself a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:44.860" style="s2">Marxist that is he uh not categorically</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.330" end="00:14:47.630" style="s2">but historically and a historic he does</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.860" end="00:14:49.370" style="s2">okay I&#39;m not I don&#39;t watch a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.630" end="00:14:52.520" style="s2">Jordan Peterson he doesn&#39;t really speak</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.370" end="00:14:55.220" style="s2">to me um but I like what Renzi had</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.520" end="00:14:59.690" style="s2">suggested if Brett is open to it of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.220" end="00:15:01.100" style="s2">talking about what pieces of under</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.690" end="00:15:03.320" style="s2">Marxism even if I&#39;m not super familiar</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.100" end="00:15:05.180" style="s2">with Marxism as its own like I know</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.320" end="00:15:07.850" style="s2">history I&#39;ve studied Cambodia I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.180" end="00:15:10.670" style="s2">studied China and Russia as far as it as</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.850" end="00:15:12.860" style="s2">communism being implemented and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.670" end="00:15:15.830" style="s2">believe in a lot of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.860" end="00:15:18.040" style="s2">pieces of like personal autonomy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.830" end="00:15:20.810" style="s2">sovereignty and how we bring that into</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.040" end="00:15:22.640" style="s2">working in my best interest also works</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.810" end="00:15:25.700" style="s2">in the group&#39;s best interest and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:30.550" style="s2">like the money piece eyes I know with</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.700" end="00:15:33.140" style="s2">common planet which is frenzies project</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.550" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">that is the central piece right is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.140" end="00:15:35.209" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">we we don&#39;t get rid of money the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.209" end="00:15:39.500" style="s2">currency has changed its changed into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:43.399" style="s2">different completely different incentive</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.500" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">incentive structure okay right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.399" end="00:15:47.240" style="s2">good transition there because what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:49.370" style="s2">wanted to go into when I was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.240" end="00:15:50.990" style="s2">we should look at the pieces but more</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.370" end="00:15:53.689" style="s2">than that in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.990" end="00:15:55.939" style="s2">conversation in Marxism and communism</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.689" end="00:15:57.620" style="s2">and and all these other isms were what</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.939" end="00:16:01.160" style="s2">we&#39;re altom utley talking about is okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.620" end="00:16:03.129" style="s2">so what is the game and what do what</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.160" end="00:16:05.240" style="s2">kind of game do we want for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.129" end="00:16:06.769" style="s2">personally and then for our community</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.240" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">and then obviously the global sphere so</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.769" end="00:16:11.930" style="s2">when you look at the the game the rules</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">that are in place now so it&#39;s better to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.930" end="00:16:15.980" style="s2">say don&#39;t call this capitalist I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">it&#39;s good to have definitions obviously</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.980" end="00:16:22.040" style="s2">but the problem with labeling this</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:25.009" style="s2">system capitalism is is that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.040" end="00:16:27.949" style="s2">okay America is not the same as say UK</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.009" end="00:16:30.860" style="s2">or France or Japan or yes a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.949" end="00:16:32.360" style="s2">same pieces are used similarly but</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.860" end="00:16:34.790" style="s2">there&#39;s different variations that within</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.360" end="00:16:37.579" style="s2">within that so ultimately what I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.790" end="00:16:39.110" style="s2">to look at is you know what are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.579" end="00:16:41.630" style="s2">things that we can all agree on like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.110" end="00:16:43.910" style="s2">what are the what should the game be</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.630" end="00:16:45.740" style="s2">producing right and then take those</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.910" end="00:16:47.449" style="s2">pieces and reformulate them so that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.740" end="00:16:49.339" style="s2">produces those things that we want and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.449" end="00:16:51.800" style="s2">the outcome that we want so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.339" end="00:16:53.540" style="s2">I mean this is suggest so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:55.850" style="s2">this is the thing that most capitalists</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.540" end="00:16:57.769" style="s2">and other people don&#39;t do today they</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.850" end="00:16:59.630" style="s2">don&#39;t ask themselves you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.769" end="00:17:01.819" style="s2">they don&#39;t look at what the game is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.630" end="00:17:04.520" style="s2">actually doing you know does the game</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.819" end="00:17:07.339" style="s2">give individual sovereignty the answer</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.520" end="00:17:09.650" style="s2">is no most you&#39;re either you&#39;re a master</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.339" end="00:17:12.350" style="s2">or you&#39;re a slave essentially if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.650" end="00:17:14.240" style="s2">know either you have the means and your</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.350" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">money is making money and you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.240" end="00:17:20.120" style="s2">to worry about making money or you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a so you know person at</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.120" end="00:17:23.169" style="s2">least in this particular instance is</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:26.689" style="s2">sovereign and then the other question is</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.169" end="00:17:30.280" style="s2">should there be other players in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.689" end="00:17:32.929" style="s2">game that are non-human corporations</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.280" end="00:17:36.110" style="s2">governments and should they have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.929" end="00:17:40.549" style="s2">same rights and to access to land and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.110" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">property as humans so like who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.549" end="00:17:43.909" style="s2">who&#39;s a player basically who are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:45.799" style="s2">players of the game and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.909" end="00:17:46.910" style="s2">rules and what power do those</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.799" end="00:17:50.120" style="s2">individuals players</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.910" end="00:17:52.310" style="s2">and so and you look at the capitalism or</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.120" end="00:17:53.930" style="s2">communism or any ism or whatever system</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.310" end="00:17:55.910" style="s2">you have if you look at it from that</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.930" end="00:17:58.910" style="s2">lens and you answer those questions you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.910" end="00:18:01.100" style="s2">get different you know answers then if</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.910" end="00:18:02.900" style="s2">you were to judge the ISM yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.100" end="00:18:05.180" style="s2">yesterday if I were to ask younger</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.900" end="00:18:06.470" style="s2">people who-who have a negative</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.180" end="00:18:08.770" style="s2">impression of companies we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.470" end="00:18:11.660" style="s2">what it is you know assume that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.770" end="00:18:13.970" style="s2">totalitarianism or you know centralize</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.660" end="00:18:17.000" style="s2">power and killing people etc no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.970" end="00:18:18.770" style="s2">gonna want that of course but that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.000" end="00:18:20.330" style="s2">it&#39;s better to move away from the labels</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.770" end="00:18:24.410" style="s2">and look at the actual what the actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.330" end="00:18:29.750" style="s2">this game is mm-hmm I agree I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.410" end="00:18:33.290" style="s2">the pieces I think the pieces of motors</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.750" end="00:18:36.950" style="s2">pertains to me and us co-creating game B</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.290" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">together is can we co-create game B</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.950" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.340" end="00:18:41.480" style="s2">meaning I like the piece of saying my</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.380" end="00:18:43.820" style="s2">individual sovereignty here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.480" end="00:18:46.010" style="s2">want I like the piece of coming together</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.820" end="00:18:47.480" style="s2">and creating games and creating the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.010" end="00:18:52.370" style="s2">of what the global system would look</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.480" end="00:18:55.160" style="s2">like but if we a thousand 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.370" end="00:18:57.140" style="s2">or worse 10 people come together and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.160" end="00:18:59.870" style="s2">create this idea and work forward to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.140" end="00:19:02.390" style="s2">implement it without it being without us</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.870" end="00:19:04.070" style="s2">keeping in mind the next person and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.390" end="00:19:08.450" style="s2">next person and the next person to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.070" end="00:19:10.790" style="s2">on board are we recreating the what was</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.450" end="00:19:12.710" style="s2">done in in every communist country and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.790" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">think done poorly and we couldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.710" end="00:19:18.380" style="s2">until now which is the concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:19.790" style="s2">power right like well this is our rules</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.380" end="00:19:20.900" style="s2">and we made them and now you have to if</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.790" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">you come on board you have to live by</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.900" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">them without them having any group or</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:27.170" style="s2">individual sovereignty to help change</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.490" end="00:19:29.690" style="s2">those rules and help them evolve and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.170" end="00:19:30.620" style="s2">help them improve I would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.690" end="00:19:34.070" style="s2">that assessment</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.620" end="00:19:36.110" style="s2">and I I might add that that it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.070" end="00:19:38.810" style="s2">it&#39;s that that&#39;s accurate and that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:42.980" style="s2">seems to be very accurate but for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.810" end="00:19:46.190" style="s2">sake of depth and deeper honing or going</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.980" end="00:19:52.340" style="s2">into that I would add to this that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.190" end="00:19:56.030" style="s2">fact that I think Marxism is is not it</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.340" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">has to be dissolved into its it you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.030" end="00:20:03.490" style="s2">know we can&#39;t keep this game</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">Marxism is game a clearly but meta</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.490" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">Marxism is not game a necessarily if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:12.970" style="s2">read Brent Cooper&#39;s abstract philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:16.030" style="s2">there is there which I just friended him</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.970" end="00:20:17.860" style="s2">but uh so I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:20.130" style="s2">different aspects of marks that have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.860" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">be embedded within a historical</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.460" end="00:20:32.380" style="s2">really approach it in a coherent fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.140" end="00:20:34.750" style="s2">and before we react to something that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.380" end="00:20:37.809" style="s2">not actually the depth of you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.750" end="00:20:42.850" style="s2">just finding ghosts or we&#39;re just having</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.809" end="00:20:48.090" style="s2">a game of hide-n-seek with marks but so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.850" end="00:20:51.250" style="s2">I would add so I would say I would say</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.090" end="00:20:54.309" style="s2">we have to we have to include the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.250" end="00:20:56.590" style="s2">aspects of marks that were determinate</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.309" end="00:20:59.080" style="s2">and that were satisfactory for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.590" end="00:21:02.710" style="s2">conditions that they cost such as French</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.080" end="00:21:05.010" style="s2">Revolution in night 18 70 and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.710" end="00:21:05.010" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.340" end="00:21:12.039" style="s2">so I feel that but but Marxism you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.900" style="s2">capitalism is game a - but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.039" end="00:21:16.390" style="s2">capitalism is the same game that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.900" end="00:21:18.070" style="s2">produced it basically what I would like</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.390" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">to point out here is the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.070" end="00:21:24.580" style="s2">perspective which says that Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:26.950" style="s2">Marxism is a totalitarian belief system</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:29.289" style="s2">according to post-modernism this is this</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.950" end="00:21:30.580" style="s2">is the core this is the core moment of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.289" end="00:21:31.210" style="s2">understanding I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.580" end="00:21:34.350" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.210" end="00:21:37.090" style="s2">according to Michel Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.350" end="00:21:38.470" style="s2">post-modernism well first of all he</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.090" end="00:21:39.340" style="s2">didn&#39;t recognize a category of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.470" end="00:21:42.220" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.340" end="00:21:45.159" style="s2">he was a historical archaeologist as</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.220" end="00:21:48.100" style="s2">such he analyzed Marxism and he</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.159" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">understood that Marxism is really a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.100" end="00:21:52.809" style="s2">failed totalitarian system he himself</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:56.380" style="s2">understood that Marxism is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.809" end="00:21:58.570" style="s2">totalitarian system and so I think most</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.380" end="00:22:01.210" style="s2">of the post modernists understood that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.570" end="00:22:03.429" style="s2">Marxism at what what parts of Marxism as</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.210" end="00:22:06.220" style="s2">you understand it would you like to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.429" end="00:22:08.770" style="s2">implemented in game be what words do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.220" end="00:22:12.620" style="s2">think are or wouldn&#39;t like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.770" end="00:22:16.549" style="s2">Penguins oh yeah right the idea of alien</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.620" end="00:22:18.049" style="s2">nation of the worker from his work the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.549" end="00:22:22.130" style="s2">things that matter in a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.049" end="00:22:24.950" style="s2">society but yeah I mean things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.130" end="00:22:27.400" style="s2">truly matter to to to building and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.950" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">helping us thrive as a modern industrial</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.400" end="00:22:36.770" style="s2">and patriotic nation or urination Canada</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:38.510" style="s2">so I&#39;m worth excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.770" end="00:22:42.980" style="s2">so I&#39;m more politically I feel right</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.510" end="00:22:45.200" style="s2">then left but however I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.980" end="00:22:48.049" style="s2">Marx is somebody that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.200" end="00:22:50.929" style="s2">understood and negated and transcended</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.049" end="00:22:53.179" style="s2">but we can&#39;t negate something without</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.929" end="00:22:56.360" style="s2">comprehending the essence or the core</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.179" end="00:22:58.039" style="s2">the Dean of the Dingaan Zeke not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.360" end="00:23:00.919" style="s2">Dean for Zeke which we have in our mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.039" end="00:23:02.929" style="s2">of the object which contaminates us you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.919" end="00:23:10.520" style="s2">know okay so that&#39;s what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.929" end="00:23:13.880" style="s2">about Marx if we&#39;re looking at the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.520" end="00:23:16.520" style="s2">the past systems and and we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.880" end="00:23:17.690" style="s2">at the present system you know most</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.520" end="00:23:19.940" style="s2">people today don&#39;t even know what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.690" end="00:23:22.399" style="s2">game is right now if you asked you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.940" end="00:23:23.630" style="s2">is the game fair you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.399" end="00:23:24.710" style="s2">game today who are the players the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.630" end="00:23:27.350" style="s2">players are individual people</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.710" end="00:23:29.240" style="s2">corporations and governments right but</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.350" end="00:23:31.909" style="s2">if you think about what the game is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.240" end="00:23:35.419" style="s2">game is to amass capital which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.909" end="00:23:37.580" style="s2">selfish property that you then use to</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.419" end="00:23:40.760" style="s2">acquire other property but you enter</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.580" end="00:23:42.470" style="s2">into this game when you&#39;re born with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.760" end="00:23:44.029" style="s2">same number of points let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.470" end="00:23:45.830" style="s2">assume that you know the money in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.029" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">case is points and you need this money</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.830" end="00:23:50.149" style="s2">obviously in order to act it to have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:52.220" style="s2">means of life to access the water or the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.149" end="00:23:55.070" style="s2">land and the materials right this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.220" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">fact of life today and so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.070" end="00:24:00.649" style="s2">playing is gaining today and and in your</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:02.659" style="s2">what are the rules well your parents and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.649" end="00:24:05.179" style="s2">the people who played the game before</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.659" end="00:24:08.539" style="s2">you you get to inherit their points in</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.179" end="00:24:10.850" style="s2">the game and so that you know ask the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.539" end="00:24:13.820" style="s2">question well is that necessary or fair</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.850" end="00:24:16.490" style="s2">you know being such that this game that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.820" end="00:24:19.549" style="s2">we&#39;re playing this physical money is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.490" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">just physical property but it&#39;s it turns</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.549" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">into power because it&#39;s the tool the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:26.059" style="s2">unit of exchange that we use access the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:27.769" style="s2">real goods so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.059" end="00:24:30.499" style="s2">the physical properties more than that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.769" end="00:24:32.869" style="s2">a super tool and so then you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.499" end="00:24:35.539" style="s2">characteristics okay so how can we</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.869" end="00:24:37.129" style="s2">compete in this game you know what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.539" end="00:24:38.749" style="s2">role in this game I have to amass this</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.129" end="00:24:40.969" style="s2">money and the only way I can get money</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.749" end="00:24:44.989" style="s2">as an individual is if I agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.969" end="00:24:46.580" style="s2">voluntarily to submit and work doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.989" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">something presumably that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.580" end="00:24:51.289" style="s2">choice but not really because I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:54.409" style="s2">limited choice based on my community and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.289" end="00:24:56.690" style="s2">my experiences etc so though when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.409" end="00:24:59.330" style="s2">when you attack the the game the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.690" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">system&#39;s based on simple terminology and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.330" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">like what are the rules what are the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:06.109" style="s2">game how do you play and is that fair</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:07.849" style="s2">and you&#39;ll realize no it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.109" end="00:25:10.279" style="s2">we imagine playing the game of Monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.849" end="00:25:11.659" style="s2">and you get to start with nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.279" end="00:25:13.839" style="s2">then your opponents get to start with</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.659" end="00:25:16.609" style="s2">what their parents and generations of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.839" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">relatives were able to amass oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.609" end="00:25:21.109" style="s2">throughout that that&#39;s not a fair game</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:23.089" style="s2">you know the time frame is different the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.109" end="00:25:25.969" style="s2">amount of money is different and then up</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.089" end="00:25:29.359" style="s2">not naturally the game itself is broken</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.969" end="00:25:31.609" style="s2">because the money itself this property</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.359" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">could instantly lose value if another</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.609" end="00:25:34.639" style="s2">group like the United States and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:37.969" style="s2">happen to be in a different country</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.639" end="00:25:40.789" style="s2">devalue your currency and so the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.969" end="00:25:43.489" style="s2">system that we have today is so complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.789" end="00:25:45.979" style="s2">and all of it is a system of basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.489" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">power who owns the land the production</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.979" end="00:25:50.179" style="s2">of labor is essentially only a few</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:51.529" style="s2">people and clearly that&#39;s not the game</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.179" end="00:25:52.309" style="s2">that anybody wants to play I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.529" end="00:25:54.950" style="s2">don&#39;t want to play that game</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.309" end="00:25:56.690" style="s2">so that&#39;s game a you know when what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.950" end="00:25:59.269" style="s2">the game the game is to amass as much</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.690" end="00:26:01.969" style="s2">property and it can extract the value</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.269" end="00:26:04.700" style="s2">using this currency and that&#39;s it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.969" end="00:26:06.950" style="s2">and and it&#39;s a terrible game so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.700" end="00:26:09.409" style="s2">whatever language that we use for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.950" end="00:26:11.089" style="s2">new game has to be something as simple</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.409" end="00:26:14.179" style="s2">for people to understand what their role</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.089" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">is and they have to actually be excited</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.179" end="00:26:16.999" style="s2">to play that game</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:19.219" style="s2">whereas today I don&#39;t know about you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.999" end="00:26:23.210" style="s2">guys but this is why we have epidemics</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.219" end="00:26:24.859" style="s2">of opioid overdoses and suicides because</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.210" end="00:26:25.399" style="s2">nobody wants to play this game</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.859" end="00:26:27.169" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.399" end="00:26:29.389" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t see the future for</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.169" end="00:26:32.539" style="s2">myself in this game I don&#39;t want to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.389" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">labor doing jobs that probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.539" end="00:26:36.589" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t even exist if for the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:38.509" style="s2">part just for the sake of proving that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.589" end="00:26:39.110" style="s2">deserve to live that&#39;s insane</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.509" end="00:26:41.150" style="s2">I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.110" end="00:26:43.040" style="s2">human being of course I deserve to live</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.150" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">of course I deserved that access to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.040" end="00:26:46.730" style="s2">things in the world so tell me how I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">should I want to get access to these</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.730" end="00:26:50.750" style="s2">things differently than today and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:53.929" style="s2">unfortunately there isn&#39;t a story for</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.750" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">that right now you know but this is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.929" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">know back to kind of my comic plant idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:01.490" style="s2">is is that you would get a currency you</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.429" end="00:27:10.760" style="s2">of course you should the question of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.230" end="00:27:13.040" style="s2">course is should you have unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.760" end="00:27:15.830" style="s2">access you know no because that would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.040" end="00:27:20.030" style="s2">unreasonable and not realistic but</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.830" end="00:27:22.730" style="s2">should you have unfettered open access</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.030" end="00:27:28.250" style="s2">to compete for the limited resources yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.730" end="00:27:32.210" style="s2">do you have that today no and so about</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.250" end="00:27:35.750" style="s2">common planet that so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.210" end="00:27:37.309" style="s2">creating a new game is awesome I love</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.750" end="00:27:38.900" style="s2">the idea of create a new game any day</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.309" end="00:27:40.309" style="s2">really cuz I really don&#39;t like the one</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.900" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">we&#39;re playing the issue with the one</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.309" end="00:27:44.179" style="s2">we&#39;re playing is it&#39;s complex and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:46.340" style="s2">don&#39;t have a choice in playing it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.179" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">I love your idea of common planet I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.340" end="00:27:51.650" style="s2">would sign up for it tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:53.059" style="s2">but like all games there&#39;s no end point</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.650" end="00:27:55.460" style="s2">and you don&#39;t really get to choose</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.059" end="00:28:00.650" style="s2">whether or not you play what is in place</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.460" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">for the negative implications that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.650" end="00:28:04.010" style="s2">happen and how people can feed that back</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:05.960" style="s2">into the system so it continually</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.010" end="00:28:07.910" style="s2">improved like it for some reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.960" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">catastrophic I don&#39;t know why but a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.910" end="00:28:10.669" style="s2">catastrophic that you give everyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:12.260" style="s2">money based on the fact that they go to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.669" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">school and just live their life and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.260" end="00:28:18.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a some outcome we didn&#39;t foresee</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:20.600" style="s2">how do people the players in the game</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.070" end="00:28:22.700" style="s2">improve the game so they can fix that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.600" end="00:28:24.860" style="s2">piece so they can still keep playing or</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.700" end="00:28:27.410" style="s2">start with a whole new game right</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.860" end="00:28:30.980" style="s2">because that&#39;s monopoly as long as it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.410" end="00:28:33.530" style="s2">you get to restart it throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.980" end="00:28:37.220" style="s2">there&#39;s been periodic Jubilees because</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.530" end="00:28:39.559" style="s2">of inequities in in accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.220" end="00:28:41.059" style="s2">capital and resources so anytime that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.559" end="00:28:42.620" style="s2">happens just like in the game of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.059" end="00:28:44.030" style="s2">Monopoly you restart you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.620" end="00:28:45.890" style="s2">continue playing the game if people</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.030" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">don&#39;t have any money to play so you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.890" end="00:28:49.309" style="s2">to restart and give them a new money</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:51.410" style="s2">anyway but this is different though</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.309" end="00:28:52.270" style="s2">Jubilee in what you&#39;re suggesting is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.410" end="00:28:54.730" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.270" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">giving people currency but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.730" end="00:28:58.179" style="s2">necessarily change the physical right</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:01.720" style="s2">just because I give you this money I say</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.179" end="00:29:04.450" style="s2">Jubilee you have access to you know this</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.720" end="00:29:06.309" style="s2">currency is equal to say you know ten</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.450" end="00:29:08.260" style="s2">thousand laptops it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.309" end="00:29:10.210" style="s2">Jubilee is just gonna sit at home and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.260" end="00:29:13.000" style="s2">you know take classes and do nothing I</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.210" end="00:29:16.050" style="s2">mean she might by the way but the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.000" end="00:29:19.780" style="s2">purpose of this new game I might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.050" end="00:29:21.550" style="s2">taking classes doing nothing that would</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.780" end="00:29:24.190" style="s2">be fine so people will do that but my</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.550" end="00:29:26.920" style="s2">point is is though that the game would</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.190" end="00:29:28.809" style="s2">be that you know we&#39;re all of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.920" end="00:29:30.700" style="s2">information of what your community is</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.809" end="00:29:32.470" style="s2">producing is available to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.700" end="00:29:34.540" style="s2">you&#39;ll be able to see you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.470" end="00:29:36.520" style="s2">everything is happening in community so</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.540" end="00:29:39.700" style="s2">as things are being recorded and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.520" end="00:29:42.160" style="s2">measured and and and you can see where</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.700" end="00:29:43.540" style="s2">you&#39;re going and you can see you can set</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.160" end="00:29:43.929" style="s2">metrics on what you&#39;re gonna do in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.540" end="00:29:45.790" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.929" end="00:29:48.280" style="s2">what you know and and what and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.790" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">actually happens so you can change</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.280" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">people&#39;s in your community people will</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:54.370" style="s2">change their behavior based on what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:55.750" style="s2">needs and desires of the community are</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.370" end="00:29:57.730" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.750" end="00:30:00.790" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna force you but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.730" end="00:30:04.690" style="s2">then your community would wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.790" end="00:30:06.100" style="s2">the the the prosperity and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.690" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">prosperity in the physical sense but</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.100" end="00:30:09.670" style="s2">prosperity you know socially</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:11.770" style="s2">structurally that that you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.670" end="00:30:14.290" style="s2">otherwise happen so then you might have</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.770" end="00:30:15.940" style="s2">to work more but those would all be</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.290" end="00:30:19.179" style="s2">options that the people would make</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.940" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">themselves so it wouldn&#39;t be you know it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.179" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be force but it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:25.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that society would collapse</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:27.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s more it&#39;s just like we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.540" end="00:30:29.500" style="s2">invent a new game but we also have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.670" end="00:30:31.720" style="s2">include that whatever we invent could</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.500" end="00:30:37.390" style="s2">also go wrong and so we have to put</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.720" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">things in place along there okay I might</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.390" end="00:30:43.860" style="s2">like it it&#39;s possible that the community</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t you know grow enough food or</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.860" end="00:30:47.290" style="s2">produce enough resources for that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:49.090" style="s2">particular year but you would you would</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.290" end="00:30:50.830" style="s2">know that that&#39;s happening because all</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.090" end="00:30:52.090" style="s2">of the instruments you&#39;re recording</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.830" end="00:30:53.980" style="s2">everything you&#39;re recording the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.090" end="00:30:55.150" style="s2">production the consumption so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.980" end="00:30:57.610" style="s2">like you were going to be surprised oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.150" end="00:30:59.470" style="s2">we didn&#39;t grow enough we didn&#39;t plant</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.610" end="00:31:02.260" style="s2">enough Apple its reason you would know I</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.470" end="00:31:04.950" style="s2">have a question for that to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.260" end="00:31:08.220" style="s2">that how would how would this</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.950" end="00:31:12.560" style="s2">Society of structural integrity cultural</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.220" end="00:31:16.140" style="s2">integrity how could such a society</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.560" end="00:31:17.940" style="s2">maintain itself over the generate over a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.140" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2">generation like let&#39;s say within a</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.370" end="00:31:28.950" style="s2">are post capitalists so we we have to we</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.240" end="00:31:31.890" style="s2">have to recognize that we have a</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.660" end="00:31:49.980" style="s2">feel we we have to proceed with a new a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.740" end="00:31:52.350" style="s2">new kind of utopianism of the heart or</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.980" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">if you will of the heart but of a higher</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.350" end="00:31:57.480" style="s2">order of intelligence which extrapolates</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.269" end="00:33:31.929" style="s2">runs you answered what that is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.619" end="00:33:34.539" style="s2">there&#39;s data feeding back into it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.929" end="00:33:38.259" style="s2">and looking at how we get there and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.539" end="00:33:39.909" style="s2">it always includes the next people how</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.259" end="00:33:41.470" style="s2">do we include the new they don&#39;t even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.909" end="00:33:42.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a thousand of us that co-create</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.470" end="00:33:43.960" style="s2">something together</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.100" end="00:33:45.220" style="s2">what is the thousands and one person</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.960" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">coming on board look like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.220" end="00:33:55.330" style="s2">ten thousand and so that is that is my</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:57.249" style="s2">final yeah I would I would agree I was I</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.330" end="00:34:01.299" style="s2">would say ha what does that thousand</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.249" end="00:34:05.320" style="s2">thousand thousand person look like and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.299" end="00:34:07.509" style="s2">then how how does that person how can I</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.320" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">guess how can we increase</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.509" end="00:34:11.909" style="s2">I think it&#39;s been called the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:15.909" style="s2">number so you can have a greater</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.909" end="00:34:19.179" style="s2">holistic on you know onboarding or you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.909" end="00:34:20.589" style="s2">know so that way you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.179" end="00:34:22.359" style="s2">spitting in time onboarding you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.589" end="00:34:24.220" style="s2">spinning you&#39;re time increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.359" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">magnitude and the amplification of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.220" end="00:34:30.129" style="s2">resonances as an as you continue to ramp</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:34.299" style="s2">up the the spiraling you know energetics</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.129" end="00:34:36.250" style="s2">so to speak of the process and this will</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.299" end="00:34:38.109" style="s2">may we can have we can we can have any</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.250" end="00:34:40.750" style="s2">system we don&#39;t fill in the blank with</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.109" end="00:34:43.240" style="s2">any system as a you know or any</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.750" end="00:34:44.889" style="s2">dialectic but it could be it could be</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.240" end="00:34:47.470" style="s2">blockchain or anything but I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.889" end="00:34:49.780" style="s2">distributed collective intelligence can</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.470" end="00:34:50.980" style="s2">come from the left or the right and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.780" end="00:34:52.990" style="s2">don&#39;t want to exclude either one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.980" end="00:34:56.430" style="s2">those distributed forms of collective</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.990" end="00:34:58.390" style="s2">intelligence that&#39;s my final cases I</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.430" end="00:35:01.839" style="s2">agree one percent with what you just</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.390" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">said there the when the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:06.280" style="s2">communists they collectivized all of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:07.660" style="s2">means of production they obviously they</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.280" end="00:35:09.069" style="s2">gathered all the information they knew</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.660" end="00:35:11.500" style="s2">what they were producing how much food</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.069" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2">etc but see all that data ended up going</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.500" end="00:35:17.410" style="s2">to individuals in a centralized manner</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:19.450" style="s2">and so in only a select few individuals</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.410" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">had all the information and had to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.450" end="00:35:23.700" style="s2">decision so power became centralized so</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:26.319" style="s2">today using computers we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.700" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">decentralize that process and change</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.319" end="00:35:31.660" style="s2">that dynamic now but one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:33.610" style="s2">problems of okay so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.660" end="00:35:35.230" style="s2">the governance structure there right we</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.610" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">know that it&#39;s best that allow each</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.230" end="00:35:41.620" style="s2">individual person their voice and vote</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:44.020" style="s2">is better than centralizing power in one</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.620" end="00:35:45.790" style="s2">person because that like jublee said at</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.020" end="00:35:49.390" style="s2">the beginning you know concentration of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.790" end="00:35:51.120" style="s2">power always corrupts so the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.390" end="00:35:53.410" style="s2">problem though is is that even</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.120" end="00:35:56.170" style="s2">decentralized power in decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.410" end="00:35:58.780" style="s2">in governance structures within a game</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.170" end="00:36:00.730" style="s2">where the resources are centralized like</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.780" end="00:36:01.900" style="s2">capitalism and the game is for</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.730" end="00:36:03.790" style="s2">extraction</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.900" end="00:36:05.380" style="s2">it means that you&#39;re still going to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.790" end="00:36:08.230" style="s2">concentrations of power because the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.380" end="00:36:10.180" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.230" end="00:36:12.760" style="s2">governance decisions about is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.180" end="00:36:15.430" style="s2">that already exists and is held by only</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.760" end="00:36:18.070" style="s2">a few people so the solution is to make</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.430" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">sure that the the game is not extraction</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.070" end="00:36:26.620" style="s2">and and collection of property as power</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:29.860" style="s2">but rather the acquisition of property</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.620" end="00:36:33.160" style="s2">for use and need for human life rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.860" end="00:36:34.930" style="s2">than for control and and and extraction</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.160" end="00:36:37.840" style="s2">through the Commons which is capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.930" end="00:36:40.840" style="s2">so once you&#39;ve changed the property</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.840" end="00:36:43.270" style="s2">portion of the game then finally direct</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.840" end="00:36:45.400" style="s2">democracy actually is the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.270" end="00:36:47.500" style="s2">governance structure because then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.400" end="00:36:49.960" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re we&#39;re voting on isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.500" end="00:36:53.410" style="s2">who gets more land and who gets more</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.960" end="00:36:55.240" style="s2">power but what should we build in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.410" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">community and how we should build it</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.240" end="00:36:58.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a different conversation then who</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:00.790" style="s2">should who&#39;s going to benefit and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.870" end="00:37:02.890" style="s2">to are going to take money from and who</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.790" end="00:37:07.390" style="s2">we gonna tax and who we gonna know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.890" end="00:37:09.400" style="s2">nonsense game right now I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.390" end="00:37:11.260" style="s2">learn Randy the conversation otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.400" end="00:37:12.700" style="s2">I&#39;m sure we game be people could go on</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.260" end="00:37:14.530" style="s2">about this for weeks and weeks so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.700" end="00:37:20.730" style="s2">say goodbye to the potential YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.530" end="00:37:20.730" style="s2">audience and then go on like a</p>
