<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">will more than make up for it</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.100" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">focusing on the possibilities on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">other side of this crisis and I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">loved a tremendous amount of what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">written and one thing she wrote I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">yesterday day before really struck me</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">and I think sets the tone for how I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:35.100" style="s2">like our little brief discussion to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:37.049" style="s2">let me read this is from Bonita crises</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.100" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">push people in one direction or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.049" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">other so we need to help each other move</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">from contraction cognitive shutdown and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:50.790" style="s2">moral dread to expansion collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:53.450" style="s2">insight and moral courage by staying</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.790" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">together in deeper communion in</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.450" end="00:01:59.509" style="s2">Parliament with the trouble we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">disclose this moment as screaming with</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.509" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">possibilities I just love that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">so Bonita what are the possibilities oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">wow so you know from my vantage point</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:12.950" style="s2">screaming with possibilities there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:15.530" style="s2">there&#39;s just so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.950" end="00:02:19.780" style="s2">of a wider breadth of quantity in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.530" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">depths of them let me just step back and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.780" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">talk about what I was feeling when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:29.540" style="s2">wrote that this notion of staying</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:32.930" style="s2">together in Parliament with the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.540" end="00:02:35.090" style="s2">what I&#39;m referring to is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.930" end="00:02:37.819" style="s2">many different interpretations of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.090" end="00:02:40.519" style="s2">going on there&#39;s many people are even</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.819" end="00:02:46.030" style="s2">updating their interpretations as we go</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.519" end="00:02:49.850" style="s2">along there&#39;s lots of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.030" end="00:02:55.459" style="s2">displayed in many different ways and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.850" end="00:02:56.690" style="s2">what I want to suggest is that yes at</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.459" end="00:02:59.600" style="s2">one level we have those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.690" end="00:03:01.700" style="s2">but at the other level to expand our</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.600" end="00:03:03.709" style="s2">perspective and see that all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.700" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">conversations are part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.709" end="00:03:11.450" style="s2">movement I wrote once whether you</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:13.819" style="s2">believe in coronavirus or not whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.450" end="00:03:15.709" style="s2">you believe it from a biological and/or</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.819" end="00:03:17.390" style="s2">epidemiological standpoint or whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.709" end="00:03:19.930" style="s2">you think it&#39;s some I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.390" end="00:03:23.209" style="s2">radical conspiracy theories out there</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.930" end="00:03:24.709" style="s2">what we can do is stay with what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.209" end="00:03:26.690" style="s2">actually happening right the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.709" end="00:03:28.700" style="s2">between your interpretation of what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.690" end="00:03:30.470" style="s2">happening and what is actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.700" end="00:03:32.570" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a lot going on and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.470" end="00:03:37.670" style="s2">what I mean by staying with the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.570" end="00:03:40.790" style="s2">staying with how things are changing for</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.670" end="00:03:43.100" style="s2">you staying with how today was different</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.790" end="00:03:47.540" style="s2">than three weeks ago staying with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.100" end="00:03:50.810" style="s2">choices that you&#39;re making today staying</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.540" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">with kind of this overwhelm of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.810" end="00:03:56.269" style="s2">information we really don&#39;t know we</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:59.299" style="s2">don&#39;t have an exact grasp on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.269" end="00:04:03.019" style="s2">statistics or the direction of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.299" end="00:04:07.030" style="s2">happening can we can we stay in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.019" end="00:04:10.220" style="s2">open space of possibility and see it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.030" end="00:04:12.170" style="s2">the possibilities that are arising so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.220" end="00:04:14.989" style="s2">this notion of staying with the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.170" end="00:04:17.419" style="s2">means who is the first an invitation to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.989" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">let go of your single interpretation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.419" end="00:04:21.590" style="s2">just kind of like you know keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">advocating for that it get back to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.590" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">like the human condition of okay what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:31.170" style="s2">our new human condition many of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:34.200" style="s2">are at home some of us are rejecting the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.170" end="00:04:36.710" style="s2">at home this and actually you know being</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.200" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">in deviant having deviant behavior so</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.710" end="00:04:41.850" style="s2">whatever our behaviors that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:45.720" style="s2">adopted to see that they are part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.850" end="00:04:48.270" style="s2">same particular situation in this time</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.720" end="00:04:52.710" style="s2">right so trying to just expand ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.270" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">out to that viewpoint I think is a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.710" end="00:05:00.290" style="s2">valuable first for first step and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:04.290" style="s2">in terms of the possibilities just</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.290" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">really be perceptive and aware and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.290" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">observant insensitive to how things</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">change and what difference it makes I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:14.760" style="s2">was talking to a high school high school</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:18.030" style="s2">students in Washington DC yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.760" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">about this it was very very fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.030" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">their comments so you know if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">going to work every day you know this</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">habits we get in we get our coffee we</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:30.120" style="s2">get on the bus or the subway we go to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:32.190" style="s2">work we do the same things you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.120" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">whole 9:00 to 5:00 if you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.190" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">that then pay attention to how your life</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:45.030" style="s2">has changed pay attention to maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.810" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">may be bored or anxious or looking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.030" end="00:05:49.920" style="s2">why do i why have I been mindlessly</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.930" style="s2">going to work you may find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.920" end="00:05:54.660" style="s2">looking across the table at your</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.930" end="00:05:56.220" style="s2">children playing in the corner or</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.660" end="00:05:59.160" style="s2">fighting with each other and ask</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.220" end="00:06:01.230" style="s2">yourself what do they actually do all</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.160" end="00:06:04.470" style="s2">day when I&#39;m not here or when they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.230" end="00:06:06.120" style="s2">school and and and what are the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.470" end="00:06:09.510" style="s2">moments and what are not the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.120" end="00:06:12.120" style="s2">moments when when we get you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.510" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">been forcefully removed from our habits</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.120" end="00:06:17.340" style="s2">so we had an opportunity to look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:19.620" style="s2">things from this new vantage point and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.340" end="00:06:23.670" style="s2">they may seem strange like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.620" end="00:06:25.470" style="s2">it&#39;s strange that people live in you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.670" end="00:06:28.460" style="s2">know one of the things the students were</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.470" end="00:06:31.740" style="s2">saying it&#39;s strange being in a house</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.460" end="00:06:33.450" style="s2">because I&#39;m in my room and we know we</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.740" end="00:06:35.130" style="s2">separate ourselves everyone stays in</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.450" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">their own room and they thought well</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.130" end="00:06:40.230" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of strange why why do we</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:43.950" style="s2">lock ourselves in it into our own room</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.230" end="00:06:47.910" style="s2">and so these these kind of noticing can</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.950" end="00:06:50.700" style="s2">really start to generate curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.910" end="00:06:52.440" style="s2">inquiry into your own human condition</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.700" end="00:06:57.000" style="s2">not only in terms of you as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.440" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">individual but you in your community and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.000" end="00:07:01.740" style="s2">enlarges you know social systems like</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.310" end="00:07:04.380" style="s2">the economic and the supply chain and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.740" end="00:07:11.010" style="s2">all of this so the first invitation is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.380" end="00:07:13.590" style="s2">to not just get bored or not just be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.010" end="00:07:16.620" style="s2">anxious or not just the argumentative</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.590" end="00:07:18.900" style="s2">about what it&#39;s happening but take</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.620" end="00:07:21.510" style="s2">advantage of the fact that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.900" end="00:07:24.060" style="s2">new vantage point can we can you be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.510" end="00:07:26.370" style="s2">sensitive to and observe from this new</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.060" end="00:07:29.670" style="s2">place and see something for the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.370" end="00:07:32.040" style="s2">time it reminds me of when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.670" end="00:07:34.290" style="s2">college and I was very parochial and I</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.300" end="00:09:03.420" style="s2">a very different rhythm and we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.850" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">and we&#39;ll feel feel emotion ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.420" end="00:09:07.770" style="s2">and we open ourselves up to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.430" end="00:09:10.260" style="s2">experience will have parallax on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.770" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">life we used to live we very seldom have</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.260" end="00:09:14.610" style="s2">yeah so and and and I think pointing</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:17.820" style="s2">that out when I you know like I said</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.610" end="00:09:21.500" style="s2">supporting people in that they can move</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.820" end="00:09:24.030" style="s2">toward this more expansive curious</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.500" end="00:09:26.430" style="s2">perspective I think we have to help each</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.030" end="00:09:29.070" style="s2">other with that because it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.430" end="00:09:32.340" style="s2">obvious you know because it is a big</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.070" end="00:09:34.770" style="s2">change and we do get sucked into the to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.340" end="00:09:38.010" style="s2">the social media and the updates and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.770" end="00:09:40.710" style="s2">stuff like that so yeah helping each</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.010" end="00:09:42.780" style="s2">other to have collective insight and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.710" end="00:09:45.450" style="s2">moral courage so moral courage I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.780" end="00:09:49.670" style="s2">is important because when we&#39;re shaken</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.450" end="00:09:53.190" style="s2">from our habits this this really</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.670" end="00:09:55.980" style="s2">disrupts the the the organism you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.190" end="00:09:57.990" style="s2">the psyche in and people can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.980" end="00:10:00.840" style="s2">surprised that that happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.990" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">surprising to some people how much the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.840" end="00:10:05.820" style="s2">disruption of their routine makes a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.490" style="s2">difference even if you&#39;re sitting at</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.820" end="00:10:10.080" style="s2">home in in and you look around and your</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.490" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">children are safe and your family</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.080" end="00:10:15.330" style="s2">members are safe and you go to the store</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:17.400" style="s2">and yeah you don&#39;t have all the choice</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.330" end="00:10:19.380" style="s2">maybe that you used to but you have food</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.400" end="00:10:23.370" style="s2">so if you think of the facts of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.380" end="00:10:26.280" style="s2">matter then they seem to be really okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.370" end="00:10:29.550" style="s2">and you might laugh at the fact of how</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.280" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">spoiled you were that you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.550" end="00:10:35.280" style="s2">not so many varieties of the certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:38.760" style="s2">pasta that you like or something but</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.280" end="00:10:42.060" style="s2">when you notice that you&#39;re surprised or</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.760" end="00:10:45.030" style="s2">you if you notice well there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.060" end="00:10:46.950" style="s2">these two types of pasta and you notice</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.030" end="00:10:49.230" style="s2">what you the the feeling you get from</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.950" end="00:10:51.180" style="s2">that the this is an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.230" end="00:10:53.370" style="s2">because you haven&#39;t noticed</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.180" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">maybe the abundance or the overabundance</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.370" end="00:10:59.910" style="s2">or the marketing or or you know when</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">when people come from other countries to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.910" end="00:11:03.330" style="s2">the US a lot of times they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:05.250" style="s2">surprised at what our grocery stores</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.330" end="00:11:07.310" style="s2">look like but we can&#39;t actually see it</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.250" end="00:11:10.400" style="s2">anymore right we can&#39;t actually see what</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.310" end="00:11:14.570" style="s2">is the case because it&#39;s always the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.400" end="00:11:17.650" style="s2">so give ourselves an opportunity to use</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.570" end="00:11:21.080" style="s2">the difference to be able to reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.650" end="00:11:25.670" style="s2">what was before and ask yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.080" end="00:11:29.240" style="s2">know why should it be like before is</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.670" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">there some advantage point in turning</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.240" end="00:11:36.290" style="s2">the tide in some respects you know one</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:40.279" style="s2">of the things that people have trouble</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.290" end="00:11:42.020" style="s2">with just in general is spaciousness you</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.020" end="00:11:48.010" style="s2">know what to do with themselves other</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.180" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">people have started to really take up</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.010" end="00:11:53.529" style="s2">you know things that they&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:55.880" style="s2">wanted to do and maybe they were just</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.529" end="00:11:57.470" style="s2">simple things I read an article the</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.029" end="00:14:46.040" style="s2">period of time 4 6 8 12 weeks whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.100" end="00:14:48.949" style="s2">it turns out to be people maybe start to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.040" end="00:14:51.769" style="s2">be less programmed to the consumer</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.949" end="00:14:53.860" style="s2">consumerist money on money machine thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.769" end="00:14:57.819" style="s2">at least at least that&#39;s one of my hopes</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:15:00.949" style="s2">yeah I mean we&#39;re hooked on the trivial</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.819" end="00:15:06.049" style="s2">desires in this trivial pursuits in life</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.949" end="00:15:09.549" style="s2">and disconnected from being resourceful</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.049" end="00:15:13.720" style="s2">and and the true meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.549" end="00:15:16.039" style="s2">practices of human community and family</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.720" end="00:15:21.049" style="s2">but you know I&#39;ve been writing this</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.039" end="00:15:23.899" style="s2">essay for that&#39;s going to come out and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.049" end="00:15:25.970" style="s2">emerge and the question I have you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.899" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">I had to ask myself a question but why</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.970" end="00:15:33.169" style="s2">is it for example that it&#39;s not why is</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:34.440" style="s2">it that we will tend to just go back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.169" end="00:15:36.660" style="s2">the rat race</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.440" end="00:15:38.310" style="s2">this was very interesting to me I was on</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.660" end="00:15:40.950" style="s2">some calls with people and people like</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.310" end="00:15:45.690" style="s2">you and me and other people I know who</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.950" end="00:15:48.390" style="s2">are resourceful have pantries filled</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.690" end="00:15:50.970" style="s2">with natural health care and know how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.390" end="00:15:53.850" style="s2">take care of I mean I have animals so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.970" end="00:15:56.190" style="s2">do a lot of like you know basically you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.850" end="00:15:58.050" style="s2">know small level surgery and injections</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.190" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">on the farm and you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.050" end="00:16:03.870" style="s2">certain resourcefulness people like us</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:07.410" style="s2">are not as affected by the this</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.870" end="00:16:09.390" style="s2">situation than people who are in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.410" end="00:16:12.270" style="s2">you know in the system in the global</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.390" end="00:16:16.470" style="s2">economy let&#39;s say and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.270" end="00:16:21.030" style="s2">why is it that the rat going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.470" end="00:16:24.210" style="s2">rat race is so tempting you know why is</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.030" end="00:16:26.460" style="s2">it that people just without</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.210" end="00:16:29.490" style="s2">encouragement or without some of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.460" end="00:16:33.780" style="s2">podcasts like you&#39;re doing why why isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.490" end="00:16:36.270" style="s2">it just obvious to them that they should</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.780" end="00:16:39.390" style="s2">turn the tide and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.270" end="00:16:41.280" style="s2">I realized and it was from reading an</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.390" end="00:16:44.250" style="s2">article by Seema Mehra</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.280" end="00:16:47.010" style="s2">it was an online magazine called the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.250" end="00:16:48.870" style="s2">conversation is that for most people for</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.010" end="00:16:51.390" style="s2">many people there&#39;s not the option</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.870" end="00:16:53.430" style="s2">between the rat race and this home and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.390" end="00:16:55.950" style="s2">hearth kind of thing we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.430" end="00:17:00.630" style="s2">but it&#39;s the rat between the rat race</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.950" end="00:17:03.450" style="s2">and a dog-eat-dog world and this has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.630" end="00:17:05.819" style="s2">do with you brought up this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.450" end="00:17:09.540" style="s2">the you know the extractive economy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.819" end="00:17:11.880" style="s2">what it is is in this article it made me</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.540" end="00:17:15.500" style="s2">realize that the Simo mayor calls it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.880" end="00:17:22.110" style="s2">barbarism but that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.500" end="00:17:24.300" style="s2">centralized economy and you can you you</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.110" end="00:17:26.790" style="s2">end up inviting people to the rat race</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.300" end="00:17:30.150" style="s2">right so this kind of like extractive</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.790" end="00:17:33.410" style="s2">economy but if that same economy becomes</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.150" end="00:17:36.180" style="s2">distributed you have a dog-eat-dog world</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.410" end="00:17:39.510" style="s2">because the economy is not set up to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.180" end="00:17:43.350" style="s2">serve people it&#39;s set up for to extract</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.510" end="00:17:48.060" style="s2">value from exchange right and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.350" end="00:17:50.310" style="s2">actually a smart choice that people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.060" end="00:17:52.410" style="s2">making because they intuitively sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.310" end="00:17:54.810" style="s2">that their options are between the rat</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.410" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">race and the dog-eat-dog world so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.810" end="00:18:01.700" style="s2">not just about expanding our imagination</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:05.310" style="s2">from a centralized to a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.700" end="00:18:10.110" style="s2">economy we have to change the function</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.310" end="00:18:12.780" style="s2">of the economy to serve the needs and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.110" end="00:18:14.580" style="s2">protection of life and people and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.780" end="00:18:18.920" style="s2">thought this was a big insight that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.580" end="00:18:22.170" style="s2">had and and because I&#39;m always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.920" end="00:18:25.500" style="s2">skeptical of thinking that people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.170" end="00:18:28.560" style="s2">not making the correct choices and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.500" end="00:18:31.800" style="s2">seem like they&#39;re making the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.560" end="00:18:33.450" style="s2">choices but I really truly believe now</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.800" end="00:18:36.210" style="s2">that this is kind of the pickle that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.450" end="00:18:39.210" style="s2">most people are in it&#39;s between going</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.210" end="00:18:41.490" style="s2">back to the rat race or what they see is</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.210" end="00:18:44.130" style="s2">if all of a sudden the economy as we</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.490" end="00:18:46.590" style="s2">know it gets distributed it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.130" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">dog-eat-dog world because it&#39;s primarily</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.590" end="00:18:50.340" style="s2">rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.610" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">we understand economies and currencies</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.340" end="00:18:58.350" style="s2">as rival risk we see them as extractive</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.820" end="00:19:02.010" style="s2">and of value so we need to reimagine the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.350" end="00:19:04.950" style="s2">economy as servicing the needs of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.010" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">and in my article I&#39;m writing about for</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.950" end="00:19:11.040" style="s2">example if the food supply chain breaks</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:12.600" style="s2">down let&#39;s say you know the people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.040" end="00:19:15.030" style="s2">have enough money to buy food that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.600" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">truckers don&#39;t get paid to truck it the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.030" end="00:19:20.310" style="s2">migrant workers all go home right well</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:23.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the earth stopped</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.310" end="00:19:26.840" style="s2">producing food it&#39;s not like the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.010" end="00:19:29.100" style="s2">stopped growing the food it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.840" end="00:19:31.380" style="s2">any of the you know it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.100" end="00:19:34.380" style="s2">Sun started defying the laws of physics</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.380" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">none of that has changed it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.380" end="00:19:40.590" style="s2">the mechanism of extractive value</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:43.740" style="s2">exchange is broken down so what prevents</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.590" end="00:19:45.720" style="s2">us from planting the seeds and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.740" end="00:19:48.690" style="s2">harvesting the food and getting in our</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.720" end="00:19:52.140" style="s2">trucks and distributing what prevents us</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.690" end="00:19:55.890" style="s2">from just continuing right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.140" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">not very it&#39;s not a real far distance</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.890" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">between doing it the way we do now and</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:05.020" style="s2">just continuing and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:08.169" style="s2">you see the government is going to try</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.020" end="00:20:11.470" style="s2">to inject money into the system so it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.169" end="00:20:15.610" style="s2">continue to do that but why do we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.470" end="00:20:18.280" style="s2">that step why can&#39;t we define the design</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.610" end="00:20:22.690" style="s2">for example essential goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.280" end="00:20:25.179" style="s2">to work on a currency system that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.690" end="00:20:27.700" style="s2">designed to protect its the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.179" end="00:20:30.340" style="s2">essential goods and services to people</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.700" end="00:20:32.650" style="s2">including healthcare and then once you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.340" end="00:20:34.900" style="s2">do that if you take that currency off of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.650" end="00:20:37.539" style="s2">the market then you can distribute it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.900" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">then people will move toward it because</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.539" end="00:20:46.750" style="s2">now it&#39;s no longer being being a local</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:49.419" style="s2">kind of community inside an extractive</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.750" end="00:20:52.980" style="s2">currency if now you can truly move from</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.419" end="00:21:00.340" style="s2">the rat race to the to the community so</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.980" end="00:21:03.640" style="s2">this I thought was a big big knowing or</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.340" end="00:21:05.789" style="s2">something that really made a big</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.640" end="00:21:08.890" style="s2">difference in the way that I understood</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.789" end="00:21:12.549" style="s2">why it is that people go back to the rat</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.890" end="00:21:15.730" style="s2">race so yeah so that&#39;s one thing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.549" end="00:21:18.429" style="s2">another thing that was a big insight for</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.730" end="00:21:21.370" style="s2">me you know just kind of modeling what</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.429" end="00:21:23.409" style="s2">you can learn can you pay attention is</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.370" end="00:21:26.230" style="s2">that a lot of people are saying oh this</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.409" end="00:21:28.929" style="s2">crisis is showing us that were how</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.230" end="00:21:32.830" style="s2">interconnected we are but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.929" end="00:21:36.460" style="s2">would like to caution people I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.830" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">it&#39;s very important that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.460" end="00:21:41.350" style="s2">experiencing interconnectedness because</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:43.299" style="s2">the system is breaking down all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.350" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">experiencing is that your depend upon</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.299" end="00:21:48.990" style="s2">the system and there&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.520" end="00:21:53.559" style="s2">there and in fact the reason why the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:56.409" style="s2">food supply or the is fragile is because</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.559" end="00:22:00.610" style="s2">you&#39;re connected to your food supplied</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.409" end="00:22:03.610" style="s2">by the system so this is not a example</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.610" end="00:22:06.340" style="s2">of deep interconnection it&#39;s a example</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.610" end="00:22:10.659" style="s2">of unilateral dependency on a system</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.340" end="00:22:13.570" style="s2">that&#39;s not that has a synchronous power</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.659" end="00:22:14.890" style="s2">to you so if we were really interested</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.570" end="00:22:17.140" style="s2">in deeper connection</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.890" end="00:22:20.350" style="s2">and I think people when they get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.140" end="00:22:23.350" style="s2">of that they really yearn for that then</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.350" end="00:22:27.010" style="s2">for example we would be able to feed our</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.350" end="00:22:30.310" style="s2">neighbors and go to the store and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.010" end="00:22:32.500" style="s2">and have this kind of more generosity</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.310" end="00:22:35.770" style="s2">this flow of goods essential goods and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.500" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">services from person to person without</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.770" end="00:22:42.520" style="s2">it having to be controlled centralized</p>

<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:18.520" style="s2">things are understood by people today</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.660" end="00:24:22.150" style="s2">people like yourselves people in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.520" end="00:24:24.790" style="s2">community all these ten areas are well</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.150" end="00:24:27.220" style="s2">researched and can be handled by a</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.290" end="00:24:37.060" style="s2">number two helps number three number</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.060" end="00:24:42.460" style="s2">so what I&#39;m hoping is this great this</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.730" end="00:24:45.750" style="s2">notion of screaming with possibility is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.460" end="00:24:50.830" style="s2">that this is this is a moment in time</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.750" end="00:24:53.890" style="s2">where people that are leading these</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.830" end="00:24:58.330" style="s2">kinds of changes can be upregulated in</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.810" end="00:25:12.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a safe bet to move toward a world</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:14.290" style="s2">that is that is better for all of us and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.190" end="00:25:21.040" style="s2">I really feel the possibility in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.290" end="00:25:26.770" style="s2">and yeah and I&#39;m trying as best as I can</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.040" end="00:25:28.570" style="s2">to contribute yeah I&#39;m very much looking</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.380" end="00:25:38.950" style="s2">I like the distinction actually very</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.030" end="00:25:43.020" style="s2">useful its opening my mind a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.950" end="00:25:46.510" style="s2">because we do our money economy is</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.070" end="00:26:50.730" style="s2">maybe it was the shipping container that</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.239" end="00:30:02.739" style="s2">based civilization that isn&#39;t driven by</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.340" end="00:30:06.190" style="s2">can I squeeze the last nickel out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.739" end="00:30:09.190" style="s2">every dollar yep yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.190" end="00:30:10.989" style="s2">that from two different perspectives one</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.190" end="00:30:13.899" style="s2">is I think we&#39;re a long way from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.989" end="00:30:18.639" style="s2">whole kit and kaboodle to change but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.899" end="00:30:22.269" style="s2">think that if we change our design</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.639" end="00:30:25.239" style="s2">approach I see that this is much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.269" end="00:30:27.759" style="s2">doable if we move to parallel systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.239" end="00:30:30.909" style="s2">you know so if we take essential goods</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.759" end="00:30:34.809" style="s2">and services off of the main currency I</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.909" end="00:30:36.009" style="s2">don&#39;t see that as being a big deal I and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.809" end="00:30:37.899" style="s2">actually I mean we don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.009" end="00:30:40.479" style="s2">into the details here because I actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.899" end="00:30:43.239" style="s2">also disagree that the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.479" end="00:30:46.239" style="s2">driving these incredibly complex supply</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.239" end="00:30:48.269" style="s2">chains are efficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.239" end="00:30:51.909" style="s2">I think the efficiencies are</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.269" end="00:30:57.009" style="s2">manufactured the the the dry</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.909" end="00:30:59.830" style="s2">efficiencies are manufactured by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.009" end="00:31:03.309" style="s2">structure or the financial system itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.830" end="00:31:06.940" style="s2">and so yes if you&#39;re running a company</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.309" end="00:31:08.470" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re forced to enter this game</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.940" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">of efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.470" end="00:31:17.890" style="s2">that&#39;s because the subsidies in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:21.880" style="s2">larger financial system make these long</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.890" end="00:31:22.780" style="s2">supply chains more efficient than short</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.880" end="00:31:28.420" style="s2">supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.780" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a manufactured imperative for</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.420" end="00:31:33.070" style="s2">efficiency at the corporate level this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:35.110" style="s2">is this is another big thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.070" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">think it insight that people need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.110" end="00:31:44.050" style="s2">know so and the reason why that is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:47.530" style="s2">the financial system is structured that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.050" end="00:31:49.690" style="s2">way is because if you&#39;re you&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.530" end="00:31:51.190" style="s2">chickens in the US and you&#39;re shipping</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.690" end="00:31:54.490" style="s2">them to China and then they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.190" end="00:31:57.730" style="s2">back what happens is the financial</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.490" end="00:32:00.100" style="s2">global financial system you know GDP in</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.730" end="00:32:02.950" style="s2">the u.s. is something like 30 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.100" end="00:32:05.800" style="s2">just finance on Finance now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.950" end="00:32:07.930" style="s2">because the more transactions that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.800" end="00:32:11.800" style="s2">happen the longer and more complex the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.930" end="00:32:15.220" style="s2">supply chain the more points at which</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.800" end="00:32:18.490" style="s2">you can extract value so the system</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.220" end="00:32:21.250" style="s2">needs these long convoluted complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.490" end="00:32:25.570" style="s2">supply chains in order to extract value</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.250" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">so they subsidize the system subsidizes</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.570" end="00:32:31.630" style="s2">movements in such a way so there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:33.280" style="s2">more more changes of hand to get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.630" end="00:32:37.660" style="s2">chicken back to your plate and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.280" end="00:32:39.670" style="s2">those subsidies make it look like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.660" end="00:32:41.740" style="s2">more efficient to do that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.670" end="00:32:44.110" style="s2">because it&#39;s a structure inefficiency</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.740" end="00:32:47.410" style="s2">this is what I truly believe I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.110" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">that it&#39;s a big part of how we get from</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.410" end="00:32:53.830" style="s2">here to there faster I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:55.510" style="s2">the illusion that long supply chains are</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.830" end="00:32:59.110" style="s2">more efficient that we actually pull</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.510" end="00:33:01.450" style="s2">that off is a big delusion that is got</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.110" end="00:33:04.630" style="s2">us stuck I love talk to you about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.450" end="00:33:07.150" style="s2">someday yep and that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.630" end="00:33:11.620" style="s2">distinction because it is efficient in</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.150" end="00:33:14.770" style="s2">the measure of money on money return but</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.620" end="00:33:17.530" style="s2">only in that dimension and as this whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.770" end="00:33:20.020" style="s2">thing is showing us its efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.530" end="00:33:22.160" style="s2">that&#39;s traded off against resiliency and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.020" end="00:33:23.600" style="s2">robustness there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.160" end="00:33:25.460" style="s2">nothing in the money on money return</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:32.660" style="s2">that says we should have had a twenty</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.460" end="00:33:37.340" style="s2">billion faced math fly for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.660" end="00:33:39.410" style="s2">inevitable pandemic the efficient supply</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.340" end="00:33:41.060" style="s2">chains of Johnson and Johnson do not</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.410" end="00:33:42.890" style="s2">send that signal right somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.060" end="00:33:44.540" style="s2">some social system has to send that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.890" end="00:33:46.490" style="s2">signal and that&#39;s where we&#39;re broken</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.540" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">well banette I&#39;ve we&#39;ve kind of read I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.490" end="00:33:51.800" style="s2">think let&#39;s leave it at that that&#39;s</p>
