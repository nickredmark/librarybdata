<p begin="00:00:01.340" end="00:00:07.830" style="s2">all right I realized yesterday at like</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.640" end="00:00:09.000" style="s2">11 p.m. that I had forgotten to do my</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:11.719" style="s2">video for the day</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">and I was not gonna do it then and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.719" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a piece of me that when I fail</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">like that when I&#39;ve made a commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:23.430" style="s2">do something for 90 days or 10 days as</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:27.900" style="s2">soon as I don&#39;t do it it all falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.430" end="00:00:29.609" style="s2">and how perfect that the audio and video</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.900" end="00:00:34.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be thinking up as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">and so I wanted to make sure I came on</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.170" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">today even though I did not do it by 10</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">a.m. because I went to a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:42.059" style="s2">meeting I wanted to make sure that I did</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">in fact come on and do one and talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.059" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">about perfection and mental health just</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">because when it seems like the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">topic for today with bells let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:01:00.090" style="s2">challenge I have been diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">anxiety and PTSD I also have ADHD and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.090" end="00:01:09.780" style="s2">suspect some form of the autism spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:11.580" style="s2">and learning how my brain works and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.780" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work and being kind to myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.580" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">has been a long path and I finally am</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:19.890" style="s2">able to accept myself just the way I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">including having bad days and days where</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.890" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">I do feel like I can&#39;t make a video or</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">get out of bed and that wasn&#39;t yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">yesterday was a great day I just forgot</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">it just skipped my mind and those things</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.630" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">happen to me all the time - and just to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">recommit to challenges and recommit to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">the commitments I make instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:42.750" style="s2">letting them all go away the irony is I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">had four things I was doing it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.750" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">meditation I remember clay going yoga</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">and the video and the video is the only</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">one I managed to do every day I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">definitely been one or two days I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:01:59.490" style="s2">missed meditation I think I&#39;ve miss</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">klegg almost every day and there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.490" end="00:02:03.420" style="s2">been about half the days that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">yoga but it was something about because</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.420" end="00:02:06.869" style="s2">I had continued to do the videos and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:09.569" style="s2">then did me time like now I failed at</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.869" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">all of them it&#39;s like no there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.569" end="00:02:13.380" style="s2">because I even meditated yesterday so</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:18.290" style="s2">there still hasn&#39;t been a day</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.380" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">where I haven&#39;t done anything and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.290" end="00:02:22.920" style="s2">know from my experience I used to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:24.690" style="s2">like everything started on the first and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.920" end="00:02:26.100" style="s2">I would do it for 30 days and it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.690" end="00:02:28.380" style="s2">like an all or nothing and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.100" end="00:02:30.450" style="s2">change like my entire diet and exercise</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.380" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">every day and it would always fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.450" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">as soon as it fell apart it fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.220" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">now I&#39;m much more into okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:41.610" style="s2">celebrate what you did do today and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:44.310" style="s2">today I cleaned my bedding and I went to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.610" end="00:02:46.020" style="s2">a cooperative talk then had to crash for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.310" end="00:02:47.520" style="s2">two hours I&#39;m taking my kid to her swim</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.020" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">lesson which I&#39;m managing to get this</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.520" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">video done literally in the moments</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">before doing that and I&#39;m proud of me</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:03:00.330" style="s2">and everyone else who is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">struggling with mental issues physical</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.330" end="00:03:06.840" style="s2">issues I don&#39;t even know what to say to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.020" style="s2">you except that you&#39;re perfect just the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.840" end="00:03:11.400" style="s2">way you are exactly as you are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.020" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">including when you need help and getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.400" end="00:03:18.210" style="s2">help and when you&#39;re don&#39;t even know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">to get help and being in that state is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.210" end="00:03:22.260" style="s2">big reason why I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:23.940" style="s2">and starting the cooperative because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.260" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">know how hard it can be to reach out and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">the easier we make it for people the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:29.060" style="s2">easier we make it for people to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">community and information on every topic</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.060" end="00:03:35.310" style="s2">the more did I&#39;m hoping that they find</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">it easier to get help I know I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.310" end="00:03:38.730" style="s2">find it easier in that situation to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:40.830" style="s2">help so it&#39;s a video for today I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.730" end="00:03:42.560" style="s2">go take my kids swimming and I will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.830" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">back tomorrow hopefully with a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.560" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">internet connection bye</p>
