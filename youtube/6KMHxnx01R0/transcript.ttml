<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">in 2019 very relevant to our conference</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:41.010" style="s2">a handbook for new Stoics I&#39;m gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">you about five minutes maybe or shortly</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.010" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">a little bit more than that of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">introduction but in the meantime this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">a good time to take out your pen and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">pencil and paper and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:52.680" style="s2">stuff because this is gonna be an</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">interactive thing you will do the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.680" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">exercises</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">now since is that this is not one of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">classes at City College I&#39;m not gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">around and ask you personally to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">volunteer the results of the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">but it would be nice actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">if after every exercise somebody wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:12.390" style="s2">to share how they did the exercise if</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.960" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">they if nobody does then fine I have my</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.390" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">backup option but but come on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">stoic values it&#39;s not not being shy</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">because what is going to happen people</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:24.979" style="s2">are going to you know think badly of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:24.979" style="s2">who cares that&#39;s not under your control</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:33.729" style="s2">so about this book that I cover it with</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:35.500" style="s2">my friend Greg Lopez the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.729" end="00:01:37.750" style="s2">book is that there is there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.500" end="00:01:39.340" style="s2">there about stores in these days as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.750" end="00:01:41.770" style="s2">might have noticed there&#39;s more and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.340" end="00:01:43.990" style="s2">about stores now it&#39;s actually beginning</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.770" end="00:01:45.670" style="s2">to look like you have to be careful and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.990" end="00:01:47.140" style="s2">selective about what you read because</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.670" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of books and many of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.140" end="00:01:51.610" style="s2">are actually very very good books</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:54.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of introductory books to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.610" end="00:01:56.890" style="s2">stoicism but it&#39;s comparatively little</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.280" end="00:01:58.750" style="s2">with the exception of some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.890" end="00:02:00.819" style="s2">that Don axure is written that actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.750" end="00:02:02.409" style="s2">is directly practical and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.819" end="00:02:04.569" style="s2">you can look at this and say oh yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.409" end="00:02:06.069" style="s2">I see what they mean by practice now</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.569" end="00:02:08.619" style="s2">usually the practical part is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.069" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">left a little bit in the in limbo what</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.619" end="00:02:13.239" style="s2">we did we greg was sort of the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:14.530" style="s2">there&#39;s very little theory in the book</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.239" end="00:02:16.239" style="s2">although there is a little bit because</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.530" end="00:02:18.099" style="s2">it has to be there otherwise you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.239" end="00:02:19.950" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on but it&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.099" end="00:02:22.390" style="s2">about practices fifty-two exercises</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">ideally they&#39;re meant actually to be you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.390" end="00:02:26.470" style="s2">know worth a whole year of practice if</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:28.810" style="s2">you want to although if you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.470" end="00:02:30.370" style="s2">to commit that to that much in advance</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.810" end="00:02:31.780" style="s2">we actually give an introduction or</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.370" end="00:02:33.639" style="s2">shortcut and we said okay these are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.780" end="00:02:36.280" style="s2">six fundamental exercise that we we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.639" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">suggest you do so you commit to only six</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.280" end="00:02:41.530" style="s2">weeks and then you see if you like it</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:43.150" style="s2">good the bat that we make at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.530" end="00:02:46.120" style="s2">beginning of the book is the same that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.150" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">that arguably the Stoics had made since</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.120" end="00:02:51.970" style="s2">Xena of sytem which is we all want to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:53.410" style="s2">happy although the word happiness means</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.970" end="00:02:55.260" style="s2">very different things to very different</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.410" end="00:02:57.700" style="s2">people to many different people but</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.260" end="00:02:59.049" style="s2">fundamentally you know nobody wants goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.700" end="00:03:01.799" style="s2">around saying yes I really want to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.049" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">unhappy it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of an oxymoron</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.799" end="00:03:06.489" style="s2">nobody asked why do you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.620" style="s2">happy happiness is the ultimate is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.489" end="00:03:09.849" style="s2">ultimate good right it&#39;s now it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.620" end="00:03:11.380" style="s2">instrumental and good it&#39;s not that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.849" end="00:03:12.940" style="s2">have it you want it because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.380" end="00:03:17.109" style="s2">do something else with it it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.940" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">a good thing but most people bet on</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.109" end="00:03:21.669" style="s2">externals for their happiness they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:23.019" style="s2">to become rich they want to become</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.669" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">famous they want to become you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.019" end="00:03:28.419" style="s2">esteemed by their colleagues they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:30.010" style="s2">to be married they want to be with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.419" end="00:03:32.680" style="s2">partner who loves them they want to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.010" end="00:03:34.510" style="s2">all sorts of stuff and things and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.680" end="00:03:37.659" style="s2">people&#39;s opinions all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.510" end="00:03:38.530" style="s2">external the storix bat is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.659" end="00:03:40.840" style="s2">the opposite side</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.530" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry but all of that is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.840" end="00:03:46.120" style="s2">lot of that is is up to luck</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:47.740" style="s2">so all at the cosmic diet yes you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.120" end="00:03:49.180" style="s2">influence it of course you can work on</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.740" end="00:03:50.860" style="s2">your career you can work on your</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.180" end="00:03:52.810" style="s2">relationship and so on but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.860" end="00:03:54.310" style="s2">you don&#39;t control it where is the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.810" end="00:03:55.810" style="s2">thing you control the corn in the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.310" end="00:03:58.420" style="s2">well that&#39;s shaping your own character</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.810" end="00:03:59.980" style="s2">that&#39;s really what you can do and so if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.420" end="00:04:01.720" style="s2">you bat your foot your happiness I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.980" end="00:04:04.300" style="s2">becoming the best person you can and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.720" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">then let the chips fall where they may</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.300" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the ideal and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">same idea of course of the book now we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:16.180" style="s2">start the book with a famous bit in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:18.760" style="s2">discourse is three to three to one from</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.180" end="00:04:19.959" style="s2">epictetus because it sets the whole tone</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.760" end="00:04:22.900" style="s2">for the book and so I&#39;m going to read it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.959" end="00:04:25.060" style="s2">to you it says there are three things in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.900" end="00:04:26.650" style="s2">which a man ought to exercise himself</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.060" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">who would be wise and good of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.650" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">these days we&#39;ll say there are three</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:32.470" style="s2">things in which anyone ought to exercise</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:35.380" style="s2">themselves who would be wise and good</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.470" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">the first concerns the desires and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.380" end="00:04:40.450" style="s2">aversions that someone may not fail to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:42.729" style="s2">get what they desire and that they may</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.450" end="00:04:44.979" style="s2">not fall into what they do not desire</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.729" end="00:04:47.140" style="s2">keep this in mind for the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.979" end="00:04:49.330" style="s2">desires and aversions the second</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.140" end="00:04:51.490" style="s2">concerns as a big leader the moments</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.330" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">toward an object and the movements from</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.490" end="00:04:55.630" style="s2">an object and generally in doing what a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">person ought to do that they may act</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.630" end="00:05:01.810" style="s2">according to order to reason and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:05.140" style="s2">carelessly so the second is the concern</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.810" end="00:05:07.450" style="s2">with what you wanted to act or not to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.140" end="00:05:10.300" style="s2">act in the world and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.450" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">thing says epictetus concerns freedom</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.300" end="00:05:15.100" style="s2">from deception and rashness in judgment</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:17.500" style="s2">and generally it concerns your sense so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.100" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">the third approach the third thing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.500" end="00:05:21.640" style="s2">it&#39;s important is to make a few mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">as possible in arriving at judgments</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.640" end="00:05:25.150" style="s2">about about things</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:27.130" style="s2">these are famously after of the French</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.150" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">scholar peridot these are famously</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.130" end="00:05:31.090" style="s2">referred to as the discipline of desire</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">and aversion the discipline of action</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.090" end="00:05:34.630" style="s2">and the discipline of ascent basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">what they are if the discipline of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.630" end="00:05:40.360" style="s2">desire teaches us to reorient our</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:42.190" style="s2">desires and aversions we really want</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.360" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">need to train ourselves to desire what</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.190" end="00:05:46.120" style="s2">it&#39;s actually under our control and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:48.940" style="s2">to be averse to things that are not in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.120" end="00:05:50.650" style="s2">their control the discipline of action</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.940" end="00:05:52.250" style="s2">teaches us how to deal with other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.650" end="00:05:54.580" style="s2">in the world which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.250" end="00:05:57.020" style="s2">big deal given the were social species</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.580" end="00:05:58.460" style="s2">and the discipline of a cent is the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.020" end="00:06:00.980" style="s2">that teaches how to reason correctly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.460" end="00:06:02.570" style="s2">about our impressions and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.980" end="00:06:04.820" style="s2">arrive at the best judgments and we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.570" end="00:06:07.130" style="s2">so the the bad throughout the book the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.820" end="00:06:09.320" style="s2">book isn&#39;t is structured along the three</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.130" end="00:06:10.760" style="s2">disciplines so there&#39;s a set of exercise</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.320" end="00:06:12.230" style="s2">for the first discipline a second for</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.760" end="00:06:14.780" style="s2">the second and a third</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.230" end="00:06:17.000" style="s2">set for the third of discipline now as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.780" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">picture of himself said there is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.000" end="00:06:20.540" style="s2">progression of these disciplines from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:22.340" style="s2">pedagogical perspective you you start</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.540" end="00:06:24.470" style="s2">with desires you continue with action</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.340" end="00:06:26.480" style="s2">and you end up with a scent because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.470" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">scent is the more difficult one but</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.480" end="00:06:31.250" style="s2">that&#39;s only pedagogical we go through</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.310" end="00:06:32.660" style="s2">the same order in the book but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.250" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">reality in your life if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.660" end="00:06:37.250" style="s2">have to make decisions obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:38.540" style="s2">enact in the world you have to act at</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.250" end="00:06:40.040" style="s2">the same time as you have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.540" end="00:06:41.750" style="s2">your desires at the same time as you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.040" end="00:06:44.840" style="s2">have to make judgments so all those</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.750" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">three actually go together which is why</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.840" end="00:06:49.250" style="s2">today we&#39;re going to do one a minimum of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:52.220" style="s2">what exercise from each of the three</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.250" end="00:06:53.240" style="s2">disciplines I have up to three so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.220" end="00:06:55.669" style="s2">depends on how much time we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.240" end="00:06:58.490" style="s2">have we&#39;re gonna go through one at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.669" end="00:07:00.470" style="s2">and possibly two maybe three exercises</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.490" end="00:07:02.900" style="s2">so let me start with the discipline of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.470" end="00:07:05.600" style="s2">desire and aversion for each exercise</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.900" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">well Greg and I did most to gain</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.600" end="00:07:09.620" style="s2">inspiration directly from a stoic source</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">so each exercise actually starts out</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.620" end="00:07:15.229" style="s2">with a quote from a stoic author not</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:16.850" style="s2">only Epictetus so to crammed it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.229" end="00:07:19.190" style="s2">actual stories I mean you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.850" end="00:07:22.190" style="s2">stuff that the Stoics actually did but</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.190" end="00:07:24.470" style="s2">then greg has a background in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.190" end="00:07:26.360" style="s2">behavioral therapy just like done and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.470" end="00:07:28.280" style="s2">then we looked at the scientific enemas</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.360" end="00:07:30.169" style="s2">my first academic career was as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.280" end="00:07:32.600" style="s2">scientist so we looked at the actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.169" end="00:07:35.270" style="s2">scientific evidence for what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.600" end="00:07:36.350" style="s2">techniques that are that work well with</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.270" end="00:07:38.690" style="s2">these kind of things actually have</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.350" end="00:07:40.580" style="s2">evidence evidence based that things</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.690" end="00:07:42.380" style="s2">actually work or don&#39;t work so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.580" end="00:07:45.760" style="s2">actual exercise tends to take into</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.380" end="00:07:48.470" style="s2">account what modern science has</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.760" end="00:07:50.180" style="s2">suggested works or doesn&#39;t work so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.470" end="00:07:51.590" style="s2">start with the discipline a desire in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.180" end="00:07:53.810" style="s2">version which remember is about</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.590" end="00:07:57.080" style="s2">retraining your desires and your</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.810" end="00:07:58.580" style="s2">versions you want to be desiring only</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.080" end="00:08:00.530" style="s2">what is under your control and you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.580" end="00:08:01.400" style="s2">to be averse only to not having what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.530" end="00:08:03.590" style="s2">under your control</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.400" end="00:08:05.930" style="s2">and the rest you have to accept you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.590" end="00:08:08.449" style="s2">to train yourself to accept as it comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.930" end="00:08:10.850" style="s2">the first exercise is on something about</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.449" end="00:08:13.790" style="s2">that we already have heard quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.850" end="00:08:15.080" style="s2">about today we call it discover what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.790" end="00:08:16.580" style="s2">really in your control and when it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.080" end="00:08:19.910" style="s2">so it&#39;s about the so called dichotomy or</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.580" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">control the famous are an obvious quote</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.910" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">there is Epictetus and karidian one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:27.560" style="s2">all existing things some are in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">power and others are not in our power in</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.560" end="00:08:31.910" style="s2">other power our thought impulse will to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:34.520" style="s2">get and will to avoid and in a word</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.910" end="00:08:36.349" style="s2">everything which is our own doing things</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.520" end="00:08:38.810" style="s2">not in our power include the body</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.349" end="00:08:41.260" style="s2">property reputation office and in a word</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.810" end="00:08:44.300" style="s2">everything which is not our own doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.260" end="00:08:46.459" style="s2">you can see if you read the quote</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.300" end="00:08:48.050" style="s2">carefully basically what he&#39;s saying is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.459" end="00:08:50.450" style="s2">what&#39;s under your control is your</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.050" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">internal decisions you know judgments</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.450" end="00:08:56.980" style="s2">and values etc and what is not in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:59.330" style="s2">control is pretty much everything else</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.980" end="00:08:59.810" style="s2">so here&#39;s what the exercise consists on</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.330" end="00:09:02.270" style="s2">so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.810" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">fog and this is where you come in to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.270" end="00:09:05.990" style="s2">them about to give you instructions to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:08.230" style="s2">know actually to do the exercise so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.990" end="00:09:11.810" style="s2">organs and something that disturbed you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.230" end="00:09:13.580" style="s2">and happen to you recently so now you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.810" end="00:09:15.140" style="s2">know a year ago but just this fast</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.580" end="00:09:18.260" style="s2">today&#39;s or last week or something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.140" end="00:09:20.630" style="s2">that or maybe if something disturbed you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.260" end="00:09:23.390" style="s2">recently something that worries you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.630" end="00:09:27.170" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to happen soon in the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.390" end="00:09:30.410" style="s2">few days or the next next week so pick</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.170" end="00:09:32.060" style="s2">one for now the exercise in the book of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.410" end="00:09:33.950" style="s2">course is done for any home for a whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.060" end="00:09:36.650" style="s2">week so you have several occasions to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.950" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">it but pick one mentally focus on one</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.650" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">event either in the recent past that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:42.860" style="s2">upset you or in the near future that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:46.750" style="s2">worrying you there is there is causing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.860" end="00:09:50.510" style="s2">you anxiety and then make a list of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.750" end="00:09:52.760" style="s2">which aspects of that thing that worries</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.510" end="00:09:55.490" style="s2">you are actually under your control</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.760" end="00:09:57.050" style="s2">and which ones are not ultimately under</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.490" end="00:09:58.040" style="s2">your control you may be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.050" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">influence them but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.040" end="00:10:04.570" style="s2">ultimately under your control I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:04.570" style="s2">you two minutes go</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.750" end="00:10:15.339" style="s2">I&#39;ll wait okay anybody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.480" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">volunteer without divulging personal</p>

<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:36.939" style="s2">with someone that you will able</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">difficult I&#39;m sure we all had that kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.939" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">of experience yep</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.690" end="00:10:43.969" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.189" end="00:10:55.660" style="s2">okay so under your control are you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.350" end="00:10:57.939" style="s2">prepare for for the meeting and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.660" end="00:10:59.019" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re thinking ahead of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.939" end="00:11:00.370" style="s2">meeting meaning that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.019" end="00:11:02.139" style="s2">convince yourself that you could you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.370" end="00:11:03.579" style="s2">need to assume the other person is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.139" end="00:11:05.889" style="s2">actually in good faith and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.579" end="00:11:07.420" style="s2">third one thing the FIR and how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.889" end="00:11:11.800" style="s2">treated during the during the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.420" end="00:11:16.870" style="s2">what is on not in your control what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.800" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">will say her emotional reactions her</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.870" end="00:11:23.559" style="s2">opinions of you the outcome of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:26.050" style="s2">meeting or actual decisions right</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.559" end="00:11:27.670" style="s2">exactly so this is the way work it works</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.050" end="00:11:29.230" style="s2">so what&#39;s the point of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.670" end="00:11:32.139" style="s2">exercise if you do it regularly because</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.230" end="00:11:35.579" style="s2">you know it&#39;s easy to so Greg and I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.139" end="00:11:39.939" style="s2">this dispute I think the stories ism is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.579" end="00:11:41.980" style="s2">one part theory in nine part practice he</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.939" end="00:11:44.499" style="s2">thinks that it&#39;s three part theory and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.980" end="00:11:46.059" style="s2">seven part practice and the joke is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.499" end="00:11:47.050" style="s2">typically between the two of us is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.059" end="00:11:48.430" style="s2">one that&#39;s more interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.050" end="00:11:50.379" style="s2">practice and I mean more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.430" end="00:11:53.470" style="s2">the theory but whatever the proportion</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.379" end="00:11:57.670" style="s2">is we both agreed that it that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.470" end="00:12:00.220" style="s2">practice is more than 50% right so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.670" end="00:12:03.430" style="s2">notion is that in a lot of stoic Theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.220" end="00:12:06.300" style="s2">is easy to understand a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.430" end="00:12:09.189" style="s2">easy to misunderstand I mean like right</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.300" end="00:12:11.579" style="s2">constantly about even professional</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.189" end="00:12:13.870" style="s2">philosophers misunderstanding stories</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.579" end="00:12:14.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s not just that you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.870" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">need to understand you need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.920" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">use it right so if you do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:21.129" style="s2">thing every time that you that you</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.129" end="00:12:25.269" style="s2">idea is and that&#39;s the goal of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.689" end="00:12:27.790" style="s2">exercise to internalize the dichotomy or</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.269" end="00:12:30.610" style="s2">control right to shift from worry about</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.790" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">outcomes to the kinds of stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.610" end="00:12:34.269" style="s2">actually under your control so you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">no longer averse to the outcome because</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:41.500" style="s2">to bad preparation on your part because</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.829" end="00:12:45.399" style="s2">that&#39;s the part you control right all</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.730" end="00:15:43.780" style="s2">you normally enjoy but it may be ruined</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.540" end="00:15:45.970" style="s2">by other people so anyone wants to share</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.780" end="00:15:48.730" style="s2">a particular situation that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.970" end="00:15:54.850" style="s2">normally enjoy but it may get frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.730" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">somebody&#39;s being volunteered that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.850" end="00:15:57.880" style="s2">right somebody&#39;s volunteers this week</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.560" end="00:16:05.200" style="s2">that&#39;s something you can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.880" end="00:16:12.340" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the situation at any</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.200" end="00:16:13.900" style="s2">conference today in Taunton Toronto okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.340" end="00:16:15.460" style="s2">you normally find pleasurable thing in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.900" end="00:16:18.220" style="s2">the subway that&#39;s good for you I live in</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.460" end="00:16:21.750" style="s2">New York so I you know but to me that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.220" end="00:16:21.750" style="s2">that thought is alien but yes go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.260" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">right so the whole system slow down</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.730" end="00:16:37.980" style="s2">because somebody else is acting like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:37.980" style="s2">would say a jerk okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.550" end="00:16:55.000" style="s2">correct so your your your possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.560" end="00:16:56.890" style="s2">options are either you say well this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.000" end="00:16:58.690" style="s2">completely under my control it&#39;s on I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.890" end="00:17:01.000" style="s2">can can actually go down the system and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.690" end="00:17:03.250" style="s2">somehow solve the situation so I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.000" end="00:17:05.770" style="s2">just you know pull out a book and read</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.250" end="00:17:08.620" style="s2">while I&#39;m waiting and if I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.770" end="00:17:10.750" style="s2">late I&#39;m gonna be late or you can get</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.620" end="00:17:11.980" style="s2">upset and make your situation even worse</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.750" end="00:17:14.320" style="s2">because you were already upset in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.980" end="00:17:16.660" style="s2">beginning to the beginning that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.320" end="00:17:18.660" style="s2">so my own favorite example of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.660" end="00:17:21.550" style="s2">of exercise is going to the movies and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.660" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">you know lights go down and the movie</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.550" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">starts and is jerk just two words before</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:28.630" style="s2">me just pulled out the phone because he</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:30.730" style="s2">absolutely has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.630" end="00:17:32.890" style="s2">Facebook or messages or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.730" end="00:17:36.490" style="s2">hell it is that they people check these</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.890" end="00:17:39.130" style="s2">days and so then used to upset me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.490" end="00:17:40.390" style="s2">because I can&#39;t believe how somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.130" end="00:17:42.850" style="s2">would do that like how do you not</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.390" end="00:17:46.630" style="s2">understand that this is a problem for</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.850" end="00:17:49.330" style="s2">everybody else behind you but then I</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.630" end="00:17:50.830" style="s2">started saying well I have two</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.330" end="00:17:53.320" style="s2">objectives when I go to the movies right</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.830" end="00:17:55.720" style="s2">one is to enjoy the movie and the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.320" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">one is not to get upset now to get you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.720" end="00:17:59.260" style="s2">know out of harmony with nature and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:02.170" style="s2">certainly I&#39;m not gonna enjoy the movie</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.260" end="00:18:03.850" style="s2">if I get upset so if there is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.170" end="00:18:06.070" style="s2">person you know if the person is in</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.850" end="00:18:08.250" style="s2">earshot from me I might politely go</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.070" end="00:18:10.090" style="s2">there and say hey would you mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.250" end="00:18:11.800" style="s2">sometimes that works sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.090" end="00:18:13.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and if it doesn&#39;t work you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.800" end="00:18:15.010" style="s2">still have options you can go back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.300" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">your seat and try to enjoy the movie or</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.010" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">you can go home as for a refund from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:27.340" style="s2">movie theater and then go home and watch</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:48.010" style="s2">Netflix right so you have options very</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.340" end="00:18:49.690" style="s2">card train yeah exactly if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.010" end="00:18:51.250" style="s2">else gets agitated and you just join</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.690" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">into the agitation they think I&#39;m again</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.250" end="00:18:59.560" style="s2">make it any better right very good</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:19:01.300" style="s2">okay so there was what two down the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.560" end="00:19:03.070" style="s2">third exercise is the first one from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.300" end="00:19:06.790" style="s2">discipline of ascent so the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.070" end="00:19:08.380" style="s2">of ascent is supposed to help us arrive</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.790" end="00:19:10.600" style="s2">at better judgments about situations</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.380" end="00:19:13.870" style="s2">right so cool so using essentially it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.600" end="00:19:15.790" style="s2">a pair though connects the discipline of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.870" end="00:19:18.250" style="s2">ascent to the study of stoic logic</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.790" end="00:19:20.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s about learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.250" end="00:19:22.660" style="s2">think better about certain situations so</p>
