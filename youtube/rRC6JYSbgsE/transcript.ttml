<p begin="00:00:08.120" end="00:00:13.009" style="s2">probably safely say on one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.530" end="00:00:15.650" style="s2">high-profile academic couples who are</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.009" end="00:00:17.750" style="s2">willing to talk about and explore the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.650" end="00:00:19.010" style="s2">issues around polyamory what do you make</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.750" end="00:00:22.789" style="s2">of the fact that you&#39;re now kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.010" end="00:00:26.929" style="s2">poster academics for this subject but</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.789" end="00:00:29.150" style="s2">there are nearly enough yeah one thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.929" end="00:00:31.820" style="s2">you realize if if you get into debates</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.150" end="00:00:33.739" style="s2">about polyamory versus monogamy you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.820" end="00:00:35.539" style="s2">it it was said by a lot of folks in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.739" end="00:00:37.789" style="s2">hall right politics is downstream of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.539" end="00:00:40.100" style="s2">culture but culture also apparently is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.789" end="00:00:41.870" style="s2">down the stream of the mating system so</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.100" end="00:00:44.600" style="s2">if you really want to get people riled</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.870" end="00:00:47.270" style="s2">up you challenge the mating system that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.600" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">actually dominates you know relations</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.270" end="00:00:52.430" style="s2">between the sexes but also family</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:55.399" style="s2">structure and has knock-on effects on</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.430" end="00:00:57.800" style="s2">everything from kind of the design of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.399" end="00:01:01.579" style="s2">housing and urban spaces to the design</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.800" end="00:01:03.949" style="s2">of careers and the extent to which</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.579" end="00:01:06.860" style="s2">people can kind of use freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.949" end="00:01:10.189" style="s2">association to form little families or</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.860" end="00:01:12.680" style="s2">poly tools or communes or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.189" end="00:01:16.850" style="s2">as soon as you kind of shake the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.680" end="00:01:20.390" style="s2">monogamy and challenge that people panic</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.850" end="00:01:22.759" style="s2">and they think like what else might have</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.390" end="00:01:23.990" style="s2">to change if this is ever questioned we</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.759" end="00:01:26.360" style="s2">actually don&#39;t really pay that much</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.990" end="00:01:28.310" style="s2">attention to other polyamorous people</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.360" end="00:01:30.170" style="s2">because we think that a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.310" end="00:01:34.790" style="s2">other polyamorous people endorse is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.170" end="00:01:37.729" style="s2">actively not to be yeah Leslie puts you</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.790" end="00:01:38.990" style="s2">find a point on it but yeah we I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.729" end="00:01:41.869" style="s2">always like to say that we don&#39;t endorse</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.990" end="00:01:46.210" style="s2">it we just talk about how it can work</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.869" end="00:01:48.920" style="s2">for some people and about how it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.210" end="00:01:52.939" style="s2">potentially a you know a better way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.920" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">have a fuller life for people who can</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.939" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">manage jealousy and who you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:58.039" style="s2">I actually don&#39;t understand how people</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:59.869" style="s2">do polyamory without an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.039" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">perspective for example and that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.869" end="00:02:02.810" style="s2">something that we&#39;re planning on</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:05.570" style="s2">exploring more and writing</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.810" end="00:02:07.880" style="s2">videos yeah yeah like we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.570" end="00:02:10.940" style="s2">hang out in the polyamory Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.880" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">groups or go to poly meetups or go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.940" end="00:02:14.810" style="s2">the conferences or whatever I brought</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.790" style="s2">all the poly books I&#39;ve I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.810" end="00:02:18.470" style="s2">familiar with scientific research on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.790" end="00:02:21.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve taught a class on polyamory and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.470" end="00:02:24.200" style="s2">open relationships but I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.050" end="00:02:28.099" style="s2">the aspects of at least American</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.200" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">polyamory culture are kind of dominated</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.099" end="00:02:35.030" style="s2">by the same far-left you know ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:37.730" style="s2">and gender constructivist views that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.030" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">absolutely handicapping to real</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.730" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">relationships so we kind of like to keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:49.190" style="s2">our distance from kind of poly culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:52.130" style="s2">even though I think we have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.190" end="00:02:55.670" style="s2">respect for the the impulse to try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.130" end="00:02:57.860" style="s2">have you know a new ethical approach to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.670" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">relationships that&#39;s open and honest and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.860" end="00:03:05.630" style="s2">fulfilling and adventurous and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:08.810" style="s2">kind of heartbreaking to see people try</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.630" end="00:03:11.510" style="s2">to do poly without understanding him in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.810" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">nature yeah I think that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:14.630" style="s2">engage in polyamory because they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:16.820" style="s2">some kind of ideological commitment</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.630" end="00:03:19.880" style="s2">right they want to show the world that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.820" end="00:03:22.130" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to escape your monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.880" end="00:03:23.900" style="s2">programming or they have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.130" end="00:03:25.730" style="s2">feminist agenda or even a communist</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.900" end="00:03:27.140" style="s2">agenda they don&#39;t want another person to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.730" end="00:03:28.850" style="s2">own them they don&#39;t want to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.140" end="00:03:31.430" style="s2">contract with someone else they see</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.850" end="00:03:33.859" style="s2">exclusive monogamous relationships as</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.430" end="00:03:35.930" style="s2">some kind of wing of capitalism for</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.859" end="00:03:38.780" style="s2">example and that somebody else owns your</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.930" end="00:03:41.780" style="s2">labor and owns you as property and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.780" end="00:03:45.019" style="s2">really do what we do because we think</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.780" end="00:03:46.310" style="s2">it&#39;s fun and fulfilling and I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.019" end="00:03:48.230" style="s2">me I&#39;m a utilitarian really</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.310" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">affirmatively from an evolutionary and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.230" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">utilitarian perspective that I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:55.670" style="s2">the best time I can have and not because</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:59.660" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to show people that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.670" end="00:04:02.269" style="s2">owned or that I don&#39;t own him right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.660" end="00:04:05.440" style="s2">still a quite small percentage of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.269" end="00:04:08.950" style="s2">actually do open relationships and poly</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.440" end="00:04:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not likely to become the majority</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.950" end="00:04:13.340" style="s2">anytime</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.160" end="00:04:15.800" style="s2">soon so it&#39;s almost like the people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.340" end="00:04:18.350" style="s2">thought that you chose to be gay or</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.800" end="00:04:20.209" style="s2">lesbian thinking we have to keep a lid</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.350" end="00:04:22.070" style="s2">on that whole homosexuality stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.209" end="00:04:25.610" style="s2">because oh my god everybody would</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.070" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">obviously turn gay if they could like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.610" end="00:04:31.580" style="s2">know there&#39;s a certain percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.270" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">for whom that works and I think for us</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.580" end="00:04:36.650" style="s2">it works for a certain percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">other people polyamory probably could</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:42.380" style="s2">work very well at least for certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">phases of their life but it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.380" end="00:04:46.730" style="s2">interesting to have a debate like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:49.940" style="s2">because I think you know the monogamists</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.730" end="00:04:51.530" style="s2">basically have the view everybody must</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.940" end="00:04:55.580" style="s2">be monogamous pretty much all the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.530" end="00:04:58.910" style="s2">and the reasonable polyamorous are like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:05:00.860" style="s2">some people can be poly some of the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.910" end="00:05:04.010" style="s2">at certain life stages if they develop</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.860" end="00:05:07.040" style="s2">certain skills but we wouldn&#39;t advocate</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.010" end="00:05:11.990" style="s2">it I think for like it&#39;s not ready for</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.040" end="00:05:13.490" style="s2">primetime really yeah I guess the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.990" end="00:05:15.740" style="s2">question that comes up immediately is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:18.380" style="s2">what are the skills I think the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">one skill that I have that helps me is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.380" end="00:05:23.300" style="s2">skepticism towards my own feelings so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:25.790" style="s2">understanding that I am an evolved</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.300" end="00:05:28.700" style="s2">creature I have certain feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.790" end="00:05:30.890" style="s2">thoughts and ruminations and cognitions</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.700" end="00:05:33.169" style="s2">and just because I have a thought or I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.890" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">feel a negative emotion or I feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.169" end="00:05:36.770" style="s2">jealous for example doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:38.300" style="s2">mean that those feelings are</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.770" end="00:05:41.330" style="s2">communicating something true that I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.300" end="00:05:44.300" style="s2">to listen to or that I have to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.330" end="00:05:46.730" style="s2">problem to reduce right it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.300" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">that those things are ways of managing</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.730" end="00:05:52.550" style="s2">the relationships that I&#39;m in that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:54.650" style="s2">in some sense vestigial and I can figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.550" end="00:05:56.840" style="s2">out a way to reduce those feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.650" end="00:05:58.220" style="s2">for me in terms of all my relationships</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.840" end="00:06:01.010" style="s2">and everything I think about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.220" end="00:06:03.320" style="s2">evolutionary psychology it goes hand to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.010" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">hand with meditation actually I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.320" end="00:06:08.480" style="s2">found meditation to be really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:11.690" style="s2">for if you take a look at your native</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.480" end="00:06:13.400" style="s2">programming if you can look at it the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.690" end="00:06:14.810" style="s2">feelings that come up and think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.400" end="00:06:17.090" style="s2">what they&#39;re for from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.810" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">perspective then you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.090" end="00:06:21.530" style="s2">dissipate those emotions I think with</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:22.230" style="s2">mindfulness and I don&#39;t know if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.530" end="00:06:23.700" style="s2">else has ever talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.230" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2">combining these two things but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.700" end="00:06:28.380" style="s2">that&#39;s how I do it yeah I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">also unusually good at articulating what</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.380" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">you actually want and then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:35.340" style="s2">committing to if I say I want that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:37.140" style="s2">then I deliver it kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.340" end="00:06:39.180" style="s2">responsibility for saying that that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.140" end="00:06:41.850" style="s2">should be content with that yeah rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.180" end="00:06:43.710" style="s2">than sort of going back on your word and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.850" end="00:06:46.140" style="s2">saying no I really like what I actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.710" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">that was this so I think it requires a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.140" end="00:06:51.390" style="s2">really high degree of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.480" end="00:06:55.050" style="s2">rationality being articulate having self</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.390" end="00:06:57.210" style="s2">insight having emotional maturity like</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.050" end="00:07:03.270" style="s2">polyamory is probably a bad idea for</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.210" end="00:07:05.550" style="s2">kids in high school and I think it Dinah</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.270" end="00:07:07.950" style="s2">talked about there&#39;s a kind of monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.550" end="00:07:09.660" style="s2">has a bunch of hacks and tools and norms</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.950" end="00:07:11.880" style="s2">that are really good developed over</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.660" end="00:07:14.970" style="s2">centuries polyamory has only been around</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.880" end="00:07:17.340" style="s2">basically since about 1990 in its</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.970" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">current form and it doesn&#39;t have a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.340" end="00:07:21.770" style="s2">of those norms and hacks and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:24.150" style="s2">is poly culture is so on judgemental</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.770" end="00:07:26.340" style="s2">that they&#39;re kind of unwilling to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.150" end="00:07:28.590" style="s2">this works that doesn&#39;t work hey</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.340" end="00:07:33.180" style="s2">everybody let&#39;s not do that thing again</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.590" end="00:07:35.610" style="s2">so I think it has to become more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.180" end="00:07:38.820" style="s2">serious and professionalized as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.610" end="00:07:40.530" style="s2">culture that says like sorry the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.820" end="00:07:44.450" style="s2">relationship monarchy thing just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.530" end="00:07:47.310" style="s2">actually work because you can&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.450" end="00:07:49.380" style="s2">sustainable predictable commitments with</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.310" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">a relationship the hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.380" end="00:07:54.270" style="s2">polyamory maybe that works better but</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:08:00.020" style="s2">here are some ways to tweak it and prove</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.270" end="00:08:04.110" style="s2">it etc so I think if the left owns</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.020" end="00:08:06.090" style="s2">polyamory as it does now and if the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.110" end="00:08:09.270" style="s2">really strongly believes in the blank</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.090" end="00:08:11.880" style="s2">slate and bad communication and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.270" end="00:08:14.790" style="s2">hypocrisy then polyamory is going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.880" end="00:08:17.580" style="s2">fail as a movement I mean I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.790" end="00:08:19.320" style="s2">free love in the 1960s people have tried</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.580" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">to manifest their relationships in such</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.320" end="00:08:23.610" style="s2">a way that they are a representation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:25.740" style="s2">their philosophy that&#39;s happened for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.610" end="00:08:28.110" style="s2">long time but I do think that polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.740" end="00:08:29.970" style="s2">is trying to be a representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.110" end="00:08:32.400" style="s2">philosophy that humans are really</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.970" end="00:08:33.769" style="s2">malleable that an emotion like jealousy</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.400" end="00:08:36.110" style="s2">which obviously has</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.769" end="00:08:38.089" style="s2">a function and I would totally disagree</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">with the idea like Christopher Ryan says</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.089" end="00:08:42.349" style="s2">that jealousy is in some sense unnatural</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.629" style="s2">and is the product of an agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.349" end="00:08:46.999" style="s2">society I think jealousy if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.629" end="00:08:50.119" style="s2">hunter-gatherers but you know as old as</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.999" end="00:08:53.420" style="s2">dirt as old as non-human primates</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.119" end="00:08:56.029" style="s2">jealousy is very very important and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.420" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">to say I think that humans can overcome</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.029" end="00:09:00.110" style="s2">any of their emotions I think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:02.239" style="s2">socialized to have these feelings and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.110" end="00:09:03.739" style="s2">be possessive polyamory is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.239" end="00:09:06.559" style="s2">saying I can overcome all of those</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.739" end="00:09:08.929" style="s2">things because that is not us but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.559" end="00:09:11.119" style="s2">is uh and so I think the way we think</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.929" end="00:09:13.100" style="s2">about it is really different in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.119" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">working with our evolved psychology</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.100" end="00:09:17.319" style="s2">rather than saying there is no human</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:20.389" style="s2">nature so there&#39;s like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.319" end="00:09:22.189" style="s2">communist idealist blank slate version</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.389" end="00:09:24.619" style="s2">of polyamory that&#39;s like nobody should</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.189" end="00:09:26.929" style="s2">own anybody and we&#39;re more of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.619" end="00:09:29.119" style="s2">libertarian polyamory that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.929" end="00:09:30.920" style="s2">everybody should take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.119" end="00:09:34.119" style="s2">what they want and what they say and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.920" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">negotiate you know consensual when when</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.119" end="00:09:41.720" style="s2">relationships that are open and honest</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">and we don&#39;t like polyamory being used</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.720" end="00:09:46.549" style="s2">as sort of a way to virtue signal</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:48.740" style="s2">leftist ideals we think it&#39;s much like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.549" end="00:09:51.049" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with real people to whom</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.740" end="00:09:52.490" style="s2">you have real responsibilities do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.049" end="00:09:54.639" style="s2">think is relevant that your evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.490" end="00:09:58.519" style="s2">psychologists that you think this way</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.639" end="00:10:00.470" style="s2">yeah I think we two things that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.519" end="00:10:02.990" style="s2">turned me polyamorous we&#39;re number one</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.470" end="00:10:04.670" style="s2">being in evolutionary psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.990" end="00:10:07.189" style="s2">seeing the range of mating systems that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.670" end="00:10:08.749" style="s2">are out there and thinking the range of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.189" end="00:10:12.230" style="s2">what people actually do in modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.749" end="00:10:14.389" style="s2">society is perhaps overly limited right</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.230" end="00:10:17.240" style="s2">and then meeting her and saying oh she</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.389" end="00:10:20.299" style="s2">actually runs her life in a successful</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.240" end="00:10:22.639" style="s2">and rational way doing this polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.299" end="00:10:25.819" style="s2">thing that I knew very little about so</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.639" end="00:10:28.579" style="s2">as I learned about it I thought this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.819" end="00:10:30.919" style="s2">great there&#39;s a lot here very</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.579" end="00:10:33.980" style="s2">interesting this experimental subculture</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.919" end="00:10:35.829" style="s2">very well intentioned often but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.980" end="00:10:39.160" style="s2">a lot of stuff they&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.829" end="00:10:41.709" style="s2">crazy dysfunctional ways partly because</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.160" end="00:10:42.850" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand sex differences or</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.709" end="00:10:45.399" style="s2">won&#39;t talk about them they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.850" end="00:10:48.989" style="s2">understand human evolution and mating</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.399" end="00:10:51.939" style="s2">strategies they don&#39;t even understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.989" end="00:10:54.069" style="s2">why monogamous marriage was invented</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.939" end="00:10:56.889" style="s2">like they don&#39;t have enough respect for</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.069" end="00:10:59.499" style="s2">monogamy to actually understand like</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.889" end="00:11:03.369" style="s2">which parts of it should be challenged</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.499" end="00:11:05.230" style="s2">first and I thought that so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.369" end="00:11:08.589" style="s2">very promising subculture that might</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.230" end="00:11:11.019" style="s2">just implode under the weight of its own</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.589" end="00:11:13.299" style="s2">virtue signaling and that would be kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.019" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">of project I think another polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.299" end="00:11:19.779" style="s2">idea is that there is no limit on love</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:22.119" style="s2">that you can love everyone infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.779" end="00:11:25.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of also relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.119" end="00:11:27.730" style="s2">anarchy that you can have these</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.480" end="00:11:29.619" style="s2">malleable relationships of people your</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.730" end="00:11:31.629" style="s2">relationships can all accommodate each</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.619" end="00:11:32.829" style="s2">other everything should be really fluid</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.629" end="00:11:35.290" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t have any kind of stable</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.829" end="00:11:36.429" style="s2">negotiation or idea about what your</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.290" end="00:11:39.429" style="s2">relationship is going to be like with</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.429" end="00:11:41.799" style="s2">any particular person and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.429" end="00:11:44.290" style="s2">that is very difficult I think it can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.799" end="00:11:45.549" style="s2">very exciting obviously but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.290" end="00:11:48.610" style="s2">relationships that have no stability</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.549" end="00:11:50.319" style="s2">that have no line of Homebase can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.610" end="00:11:51.999" style="s2">incredibly heartbreaking can cause a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.319" end="00:11:53.649" style="s2">tremendous amount of jealousy and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.999" end="00:11:55.689" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re living some big</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.649" end="00:11:57.819" style="s2">cosmopolitan area and you&#39;re a young</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.689" end="00:12:00.490" style="s2">person like you&#39;re somebody young living</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.819" end="00:12:01.959" style="s2">here in inland and there&#39;s this troop of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.490" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">people I think called the unicorns and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.959" end="00:12:05.769" style="s2">they&#39;re polyamorous and there was some</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:08.319" style="s2">vice documentary about their different</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.769" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">problems and you definitely see that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.319" end="00:12:13.259" style="s2">without kind of a home base so that any</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:16.569" style="s2">one particular person that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.259" end="00:12:18.089" style="s2">serious bond with it can actually just</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.569" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">leave you feeling very lonely and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.089" end="00:12:24.040" style="s2">abandoned continuously and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:26.259" style="s2">kind of one problem the other idea is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.040" end="00:12:28.029" style="s2">that somebody can you know through</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.259" end="00:12:29.649" style="s2">talking out your problems through</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.029" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">discussing things with people you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.649" end="00:12:34.149" style="s2">eradicate your jealousy with</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:37.389" style="s2">conversation right because it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.149" end="00:12:40.119" style="s2">socially constructed or it&#39;s it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.389" end="00:12:42.309" style="s2">an agricultural society or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.119" end="00:12:44.040" style="s2">it actually should be easy to deprogram</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.309" end="00:12:46.440" style="s2">yourself of jealousy because</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.040" end="00:12:49.230" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing deep-rooted or in you</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.440" end="00:12:50.820" style="s2">know fundamentally human about it and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.230" end="00:12:53.730" style="s2">some sense I you know that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.820" end="00:12:56.310" style="s2">growth mindset I can appreciate but on</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.730" end="00:12:57.779" style="s2">the other hand it does cause a huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.310" end="00:13:00.449" style="s2">amount of shame that I know of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.779" end="00:13:02.910" style="s2">who can&#39;t seem to relinquish their their</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.449" end="00:13:05.160" style="s2">jealousy and I know that polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.910" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">people sometimes look down on for</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.160" end="00:13:08.040" style="s2">example people in open relationships or</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:09.569" style="s2">swingers</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.040" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">I actually think swinging is like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.569" end="00:13:13.470" style="s2">really great technique you could call it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:15.509" style="s2">a technology of figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.470" end="00:13:18.420" style="s2">solve the problem of sexual boredom and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.509" end="00:13:19.800" style="s2">also how to get the excitement of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.420" end="00:13:21.810" style="s2">your partner flirt with or being</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.800" end="00:13:24.029" style="s2">attracted to someone else it&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.810" end="00:13:26.370" style="s2">natural thing to see your partner</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.029" end="00:13:28.019" style="s2">flirting with or interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.370" end="00:13:29.730" style="s2">somebody else who thinks that they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.019" end="00:13:33.000" style="s2">attractive and it definitely makes you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.730" end="00:13:34.259" style="s2">think more of your partner&#39;s value it</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.000" end="00:13:35.579" style="s2">makes you value them more and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.259" end="00:13:37.199" style="s2">potentially take them for granted less</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.579" end="00:13:39.329" style="s2">but we don&#39;t see our partners in</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.199" end="00:13:40.709" style="s2">contexts like that very much in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.329" end="00:13:42.449" style="s2">society where people are nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.709" end="00:13:44.750" style="s2">families and they&#39;re atomized so I know</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.449" end="00:13:47.160" style="s2">polyamorous people who sort of poopoo</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.750" end="00:13:48.360" style="s2">swinging but swinging is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.160" end="00:13:49.980" style="s2">really ingenious solution to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.360" end="00:13:51.540" style="s2">problem it&#39;s pretty hard to be jealous</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.980" end="00:13:52.230" style="s2">if you&#39;re currently having sex with</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.540" end="00:13:55.380" style="s2">somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.230" end="00:13:56.459" style="s2">and also if you as a couple have sex</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.380" end="00:13:59.250" style="s2">with other couples which is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.459" end="00:14:01.889" style="s2">swingers generally do then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.250" end="00:14:03.720" style="s2">a aspect of having a new experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.889" end="00:14:05.610" style="s2">together which can strengthen your your</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.720" end="00:14:08.630" style="s2">basic relationship the infinite love</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.610" end="00:14:11.399" style="s2">thing I keep encountering right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.630" end="00:14:13.319" style="s2">it&#39;s completely bizarre because from my</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.399" end="00:14:17.819" style="s2">point of view romantic love as an</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.319" end="00:14:19.889" style="s2">emotion right is actually a way of for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.819" end="00:14:21.990" style="s2">person to go here is a potential mate</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.889" end="00:14:24.510" style="s2">they seem like a good prospect I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.990" end="00:14:26.430" style="s2">to focus my mating effort on them being</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.510" end="00:14:29.100" style="s2">in love means I&#39;m going to devote a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.430" end="00:14:31.949" style="s2">of time and energy and attention to</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.100" end="00:14:35.250" style="s2">courting them and impressing them so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.949" end="00:14:38.010" style="s2">it is a way of taking limited resources</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.250" end="00:14:40.439" style="s2">and channeling them to a potential mate</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.010" end="00:14:43.709" style="s2">that&#39;s what romantic love or being in</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.439" end="00:14:47.819" style="s2">love is and if the polyamory people say</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.709" end="00:14:49.949" style="s2">but of an infinite it&#39;s like why do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.819" end="00:14:50.370" style="s2">guys use Google Calendar to organize</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.949" end="00:14:53.640" style="s2">your day</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.370" end="00:14:55.529" style="s2">then like time is finite money is finite</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.640" end="00:14:57.420" style="s2">attention is finite the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.529" end="00:15:00.839" style="s2">talking you can handle is finite if</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:03.150" style="s2">you&#39;re an introvert so why pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.839" end="00:15:06.270" style="s2">like love is infinite</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.150" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">if every constituent element of love is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.270" end="00:15:13.620" style="s2">finite and has to be managed carefully</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:14.820" style="s2">it&#39;s just fucking empty rhetoric sounds</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.620" end="00:15:17.690" style="s2">what you almost think about it in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.820" end="00:15:20.550" style="s2">masculine kind of transactional way I</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.690" end="00:15:23.010" style="s2">think transactional is is probably fair</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.550" end="00:15:24.750" style="s2">I yeah I mean you could say that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.010" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">thinking about it in a in a masculine</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.750" end="00:15:30.660" style="s2">way well you&#39;ve got quite a masculine</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:31.980" style="s2">brain in certain ways but people say</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.660" end="00:15:34.589" style="s2">transactional like that&#39;s a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.980" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">but we&#39;re both kind of libertarian and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.589" end="00:15:40.710" style="s2">to us like transactional is is win-win</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:43.610" style="s2">voluntary exchanges of like goods and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.710" end="00:15:47.010" style="s2">services and affection and commitment so</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.610" end="00:15:50.070" style="s2">if you&#39;re upfront about what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.010" end="00:15:52.170" style="s2">transaction is and also how likely is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.070" end="00:15:54.660" style="s2">to be repeated how long will it last are</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.170" end="00:15:57.779" style="s2">you committed that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.660" end="00:16:00.720" style="s2">because that&#39;s honest and open I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.779" end="00:16:02.610" style="s2">the problem with polyamory at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:06.060" style="s2">is it hasn&#39;t been around long enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.610" end="00:16:08.580" style="s2">right it&#39;s only been around 30 years for</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.060" end="00:16:10.950" style="s2">it to develop good kind of social norms</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.580" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">and expectations about all these roles</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.950" end="00:16:16.709" style="s2">and how they work it would be as if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">tried to run a fortune 500 company</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.709" end="00:16:23.790" style="s2">but you had just invented the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:26.760" style="s2">a boss and a laborer and management and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.790" end="00:16:28.740" style="s2">and accounting and marketing and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.760" end="00:16:31.890" style="s2">were trying to invent all of it all at</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.740" end="00:16:36.080" style="s2">once right it&#39;ll probably take two or</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.890" end="00:16:39.150" style="s2">three generations before polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.080" end="00:16:41.640" style="s2">regularly works like anywhere near as</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.150" end="00:16:44.370" style="s2">well as monogamous marriage which has</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.640" end="00:16:46.110" style="s2">been under continual R&amp;D for thousands</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.370" end="00:16:47.970" style="s2">of years yeah there&#39;s like a technology</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.110" end="00:16:49.140" style="s2">of monogamy there&#39;s common problems that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.970" end="00:16:51.270" style="s2">you have and you can talk to your</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.140" end="00:16:52.410" style="s2">grandma or your mom about the problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.270" end="00:16:54.630" style="s2">you&#39;re having with your spouse and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.410" end="00:16:56.550" style="s2">they&#39;ll have advice that they know from</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.630" end="00:16:56.970" style="s2">other people because everybody has done</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.550" end="00:16:59.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.970" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">whereas with polyamory it is a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:03.690" style="s2">weird subculture it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:05.400" style="s2">subculture and actually being really</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.690" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">clear about your expectations for other</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.400" end="00:17:10.560" style="s2">is actually a violation of many of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:13.500" style="s2">rules of that subculture which is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.560" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">there&#39;s limitless love and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.500" end="00:17:16.860" style="s2">some sense a lot of these people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:19.079" style="s2">nearly limitless time that they have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.860" end="00:17:21.530" style="s2">expend on these multiple relationships</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.079" end="00:17:24.360" style="s2">that they&#39;re cultivating and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.530" end="00:17:26.189" style="s2">maybe polyamory for busy people is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.360" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of looking at but also a</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.189" end="00:17:29.490" style="s2">technology of polyamory which is saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:30.840" style="s2">actually you know you have to bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.490" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">evolutionary psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.840" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">understanding and human nature and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:37.470" style="s2">understanding of emotions and also a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:40.350" style="s2">skeptical view of your own emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.470" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">your own jealousy to bear otherwise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.350" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">actually not going to work because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:45.690" style="s2">you think everything&#39;s socialized if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:48.180" style="s2">think everybody is infinitely malleable</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.690" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">and if you believe that your</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.180" end="00:17:51.630" style="s2">relationships should be able to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">and take any form from one day to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.630" end="00:17:55.980" style="s2">next in an almost you know protium way</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:58.410" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to be pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.980" end="00:18:01.140" style="s2">organize your life around variables that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.410" end="00:18:03.180" style="s2">are not at all consistent and the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.140" end="00:18:06.180" style="s2">thing that people in sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.180" end="00:18:08.520" style="s2">polyamorous communities that I know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.180" end="00:18:10.350" style="s2">people on the fringes of it say is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.520" end="00:18:12.510" style="s2">just endless processing it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.350" end="00:18:15.960" style="s2">endless emotional labor and processing</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.510" end="00:18:17.820" style="s2">and and they find it far more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.960" end="00:18:20.100" style="s2">than a monogamous relationship just</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.820" end="00:18:24.150" style="s2">because of that kind of emotional time</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.100" end="00:18:26.160" style="s2">spent yeah so we we I know we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.150" end="00:18:29.190" style="s2">sound like very cold calculating</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.160" end="00:18:31.500" style="s2">sociopath somehow we discuss this but</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.190" end="00:18:33.900" style="s2">this is through like years of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.500" end="00:18:37.260" style="s2">bittersweet experience of realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.900" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">if you have a clear enough frame for</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.260" end="00:18:42.390" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and you can explain it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:44.520" style="s2">clearly enough to other people then</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.390" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">there&#39;s actually room for a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.520" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">affection and tenderness and love and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.450" end="00:18:53.220" style="s2">passion to flourish without all this</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:56.790" style="s2">fucking processing without all the</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.790" end="00:19:01.230" style="s2">a less well you know yourself the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:02.260" style="s2">you have to constantly renegotiate</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.260" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">every one so I think the typical levels</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.800" end="00:19:12.580" style="s2">of poly drama that people get into are a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:15.880" style="s2">direct result of polyamory not having</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.580" end="00:19:20.260" style="s2">enough clear hacks for how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.880" end="00:19:22.410" style="s2">stuff efficiently and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.260" end="00:19:25.090" style="s2">monogamy there&#39;s also plenty of</p>

<p begin="00:19:29.410" end="00:19:34.270" style="s2">points of couples therapy is to equip</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.270" end="00:19:39.550" style="s2">know that are less destructive</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.100" end="00:19:43.390" style="s2">I think poly has to embrace that and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.550" end="00:19:47.230" style="s2">has to be willing to say you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.390" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">way to get to the limitless love and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.230" end="00:19:51.910" style="s2">being able to have wonderful close</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:55.990" style="s2">relationships with people it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.910" end="00:19:58.510" style="s2">to be just totally economic and upfront</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.990" end="00:20:02.200" style="s2">about what your your parameters are and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.510" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">your rules and your norms and like take</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.200" end="00:20:08.020" style="s2">the things seriously and and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:10.060" style="s2">always be trying to play catch up so</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.020" end="00:20:11.980" style="s2">like well that didn&#39;t work let&#39;s process</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.060" end="00:20:14.710" style="s2">it over that failed as well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.980" end="00:20:18.430" style="s2">process that&#39;s more like that&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.710" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">to live yeah so I think that we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.430" end="00:20:21.940" style="s2">probably emerge people do tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:23.560" style="s2">very open and honest dialogues often</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.940" end="00:20:25.350" style="s2">about how they&#39;re feeling but is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.560" end="00:20:27.910" style="s2">really couched in anything in particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.350" end="00:20:31.260" style="s2">like I think when something&#39;s couched in</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.910" end="00:20:34.060" style="s2">evolutionary psychology so for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.260" end="00:20:35.620" style="s2">you can ask that you can have them leave</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.060" end="00:20:39.220" style="s2">this in or not but I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.620" end="00:20:40.990" style="s2">tell a little story all right so we had</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.220" end="00:20:44.230" style="s2">a woman that we see together</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.990" end="00:20:45.250" style="s2">stay with us for several days and while</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.230" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">we were all together</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.250" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">I missed Jeffrey even though he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:50.980" style="s2">there with me the whole time but when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:52.540" style="s2">were all three of us together he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.980" end="00:20:56.290" style="s2">I was there he&#39;s like why would I miss</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.540" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">you you were there right and so after</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.290" end="00:21:00.070" style="s2">she left I was very excited to have like</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.530" style="s2">his attention all to myself</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.070" end="00:21:04.360" style="s2">again and if from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.530" end="00:21:07.030" style="s2">perspective obviously that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.360" end="00:21:09.070" style="s2">like I&#39;m trying to in some sense well</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.030" end="00:21:10.510" style="s2">not even just some sense in every sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.070" end="00:21:12.610" style="s2">we sort of monopolize David his</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.510" end="00:21:13.860" style="s2">investment and so that&#39;s why I felt so</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.610" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">relieved and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.860" end="00:21:19.590" style="s2">if I had no understanding about that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:22.110" style="s2">might feel ashamed or bad that I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.590" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">excited to have him all to myself or</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.110" end="00:21:25.559" style="s2">that because I didn&#39;t actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">jealous when we were together I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.559" end="00:21:28.920" style="s2">felt like I wanted his attention and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:31.410" style="s2">was happy to have his attention again</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.920" end="00:21:34.020" style="s2">when we got back together yeah oh you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.410" end="00:21:37.049" style="s2">might you might miss misconstrue your</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.020" end="00:21:40.049" style="s2">unhappiness as being either my fault</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.049" end="00:21:42.660" style="s2">right or her fault we might not have the</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.660" end="00:21:51.740" style="s2">wanted from me yeah and and that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.510" end="00:22:20.190" style="s2">make sense of some of these little</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.030" end="00:22:21.750" style="s2">issues of pom-pom because because we</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.190" end="00:22:24.059" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked mostly about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.750" end="00:22:26.669" style="s2">individual the psychological aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.059" end="00:22:30.150" style="s2">it so far but there are sort of societal</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.669" end="00:22:32.580" style="s2">ramifications and I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.150" end="00:22:34.410" style="s2">something that that&#39;s eeveelution area</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.580" end="00:22:35.790" style="s2">biologist for example are very</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.410" end="00:22:38.160" style="s2">interested in it&#39;s like what would it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.790" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">look like if we kind of moved over</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.160" end="00:22:43.260" style="s2">wholesale towards a new religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:46.919" style="s2">relationship model and one of the one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.260" end="00:22:49.110" style="s2">the criticisms is that what would happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.919" end="00:22:51.480" style="s2">is that there would be a sort of a small</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.110" end="00:22:54.510" style="s2">set of hyper successful men and polygamy</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.480" end="00:22:56.490" style="s2">would degenerate into polygyny which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.510" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">kind of one men one man man having</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.490" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">access to many women what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:02.520" style="s2">make of that I start talking about two</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">things so one thing is that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.520" end="00:23:05.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">relationship architectures that you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.610" end="00:23:08.850" style="s2">look at and we&#39;ve picked and shoot you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:11.490" style="s2">know chosen from a variety different</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.850" end="00:23:14.460" style="s2">ideas in order to cobble together a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.490" end="00:23:16.590" style="s2">system that kind of works for us but Dan</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.460" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">Savage is a prominent you know sex</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.590" end="00:23:20.520" style="s2">advice columnist talks about something</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:21.860" style="s2">called monogamish which is being</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.520" end="00:23:25.010" style="s2">monogamous but then having</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.860" end="00:23:27.770" style="s2">room for outside liaisons and that can</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.010" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">be something as small as you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.770" end="00:23:31.730" style="s2">somebody seeing a sex worker it can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:33.290" style="s2">don&#39;t-ask-don&#39;t-tell out of town kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.730" end="00:23:34.250" style="s2">thing there&#39;s all kinds of different</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.290" end="00:23:36.500" style="s2">ways of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.250" end="00:23:38.390" style="s2">and so this monogamish actually seems to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.500" end="00:23:39.860" style="s2">me the most stable relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.390" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">architecture so I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.860" end="00:23:44.929" style="s2">polyamory is necessarily super stable</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:46.460" style="s2">especially not as its practiced overall</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.929" end="00:23:49.070" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple reasons why I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.460" end="00:23:51.860" style="s2">monogamish is more stable than straight</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.070" end="00:23:53.480" style="s2">monogamous right one of these ideas is</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.860" end="00:23:55.640" style="s2">that in monogamous culture there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.480" end="00:23:57.559" style="s2">idea that if you want to have sex with</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.640" end="00:23:59.510" style="s2">or you have a crush on or you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.559" end="00:24:01.309" style="s2">romantic ruminations about someone else</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.510" end="00:24:03.410" style="s2">it means there&#39;s something lacking and</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.309" end="00:24:05.750" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of home base pair</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.410" end="00:24:08.210" style="s2">relationship and that&#39;s I think a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.750" end="00:24:10.820" style="s2">pernicious and bad idea and so what</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.210" end="00:24:12.440" style="s2">happens sometimes is that one person or</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.820" end="00:24:14.870" style="s2">the other will start to fantasize about</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.440" end="00:24:17.540" style="s2">a third person and then they&#39;ll think</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.870" end="00:24:19.850" style="s2">okay I&#39;m risking so much in terms of my</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.540" end="00:24:22.130" style="s2">main relationship by having fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.850" end="00:24:24.830" style="s2">about this other person that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.130" end="00:24:26.150" style="s2">dissonance clicks in and they think I</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.830" end="00:24:28.820" style="s2">must be really in love with this other</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.150" end="00:24:30.230" style="s2">person and not all of my partner if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.820" end="00:24:31.760" style="s2">willing to take these risks for this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.230" end="00:24:33.770" style="s2">other person and then what will</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.760" end="00:24:35.720" style="s2">sometimes happen is you know this new</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.770" end="00:24:37.970" style="s2">relationship energy right there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.720" end="00:24:40.220" style="s2">flurry of excitement about this other</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.970" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">person and then ultimately it burns out</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.220" end="00:24:43.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t know the person as well as you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.600" end="00:24:47.750" style="s2">thought you did for example so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.400" end="00:24:49.309" style="s2">we evolved in a system where there was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.750" end="00:24:51.169" style="s2">lot of monogamy at least for several</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.309" end="00:24:52.490" style="s2">years oftentimes while children were</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.169" end="00:24:53.780" style="s2">young but there&#39;s also a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.490" end="00:24:55.460" style="s2">dalliance --is and there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.780" end="00:24:57.110" style="s2">Affairs and there was a lot of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.460" end="00:25:00.020" style="s2">you know who you were going to see next</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.110" end="00:25:04.280" style="s2">and so I think that monogamish which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.020" end="00:25:05.870" style="s2">having some outside allowance reduces</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.280" end="00:25:08.330" style="s2">the chance of a stable relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.870" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">necessarily breaking up because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.330" end="00:25:14.330" style="s2">person who cheats for example or who</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:16.820" style="s2">asks to make a negotiation isn&#39;t risking</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.330" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">everything and also the idea isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.820" end="00:25:19.940" style="s2">if you want to sleep with somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:23.540" style="s2">it means that your primary relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.940" end="00:25:25.400" style="s2">is is doomed or is you&#39;re not in love</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.540" end="00:25:26.600" style="s2">with that person anymore the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.400" end="00:25:29.539" style="s2">people have to understand is</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.600" end="00:25:31.460" style="s2">meeting market dynamics and like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.539" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">the local sex ratio what is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.460" end="00:25:34.490" style="s2">distribution of mate values that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:38.179" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.490" end="00:25:39.679" style="s2">how do people pair up I mean the weird</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.179" end="00:25:42.470" style="s2">thing is you see a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.679" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">their twenties doing casual dating which</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.470" end="00:25:50.840" style="s2">is basically disorganized unethical</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.999" end="00:28:10.019" style="s2">exacerbate that problem and that the men</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.220" end="00:28:11.519" style="s2">who are the in cells or who are losing</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.019" end="00:28:13.980" style="s2">out on the mating game are just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.519" end="00:28:15.809" style="s2">lose harder but I haven&#39;t really had</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.980" end="00:28:17.369" style="s2">that experience at all so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.809" end="00:28:19.619" style="s2">involved in these kind of cultures of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.369" end="00:28:22.769" style="s2">that are very matriarchal where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.619" end="00:28:24.869" style="s2">lot of women that date various different</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.769" end="00:28:26.789" style="s2">men and they all vouch for certain men</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.869" end="00:28:28.860" style="s2">and they&#39;ll often there&#39;s just so little</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.789" end="00:28:30.659" style="s2">jealousy about men they&#39;ll say this guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.860" end="00:28:32.820" style="s2">just makes a wonderful meal and he will</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.659" end="00:28:34.499" style="s2">take you on a really lovely date and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.820" end="00:28:37.409" style="s2">the kind of man who wouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.499" end="00:28:39.119" style="s2">make a good full-time boyfriend or who</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.409" end="00:28:40.409" style="s2">potentially needs leveling up before</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.119" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">they get to the point where they can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.409" end="00:28:43.860" style="s2">a good full time boyfriend is actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:45.779" style="s2">the kind of person who&#39;d be great to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.860" end="00:28:47.340" style="s2">once a week right so there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.779" end="00:28:49.409" style="s2">of something called a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.340" end="00:28:51.419" style="s2">escalator which is you start seeing each</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.409" end="00:28:52.830" style="s2">other you know every once in a while</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.419" end="00:28:53.970" style="s2">then you see each other more than you</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.830" end="00:28:55.730" style="s2">move in together then you get married</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.970" end="00:28:58.169" style="s2">then you have children then you die and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.730" end="00:29:00.629" style="s2">that is the relationship escalator and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.169" end="00:29:02.820" style="s2">kind of an alternative to that is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.629" end="00:29:05.460" style="s2">and people find this really profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.820" end="00:29:07.619" style="s2">unromantic but I think about the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.460" end="00:29:09.659" style="s2">I date and the and the kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.619" end="00:29:11.730" style="s2">and sexual sphere that I&#39;m in as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.659" end="00:29:14.460" style="s2">a marketplace right I have people that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.730" end="00:29:16.200" style="s2">trade with right more most often and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.460" end="00:29:18.809" style="s2">that I engage with most often there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.200" end="00:29:22.259" style="s2">really blurry lines between friends and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.809" end="00:29:23.610" style="s2">lovers and obviously people can come in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.259" end="00:29:25.710" style="s2">and out of my life and in various</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.610" end="00:29:28.950" style="s2">different roles but I have an idea about</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.710" end="00:29:30.269" style="s2">what you know what I want from somebody</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.950" end="00:29:32.039" style="s2">else and what role they&#39;ll fulfill and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.269" end="00:29:34.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to be everything and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.039" end="00:29:35.970" style="s2">ever and and all things to me and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.440" end="00:29:38.759" style="s2">that puts a lot less pressure on them</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.970" end="00:29:40.230" style="s2">but also we get to enjoy each other and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.759" end="00:29:42.179" style="s2">we get to enjoy a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.230" end="00:29:45.179" style="s2">variety that we wouldn&#39;t be able to if</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.179" end="00:29:46.589" style="s2">we were just closed off to one another</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.179" end="00:29:48.599" style="s2">and in terms of strengthening the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.589" end="00:29:52.440" style="s2">primary relationship that I&#39;m in with</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.599" end="00:29:54.210" style="s2">Jeffrey I see him having other people</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.440" end="00:29:56.279" style="s2">admiring him having other people flirt</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.210" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">with him I see how he manages other</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.279" end="00:30:00.539" style="s2">relations with other people and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:02.129" style="s2">actually causes me to admire him more</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.539" end="00:30:05.249" style="s2">and to think that I&#39;m getting a better</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.129" end="00:30:08.460" style="s2">deal and also to be happier to share him</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.249" end="00:30:11.700" style="s2">because in that sense if somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.460" end="00:30:14.820" style="s2">high status and is admired by multiple</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.700" end="00:30:16.889" style="s2">people then you&#39;re getting a sharing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.820" end="00:30:19.289" style="s2">better than having one person all to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.889" end="00:30:21.379" style="s2">yourself that no one else wants well</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.289" end="00:30:24.659" style="s2">also you&#39;re really good at like taking</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.379" end="00:30:27.210" style="s2">kind of weird-ass be eccentric guys and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.659" end="00:30:29.249" style="s2">who would not make good primary</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.210" end="00:30:31.019" style="s2">boyfriends and kind of leveling them up</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.249" end="00:30:33.389" style="s2">and training them so that they are then</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.019" end="00:30:35.399" style="s2">presentable to other women right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.389" end="00:30:39.419" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing you&#39;ve done you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.399" end="00:30:40.200" style="s2">multiple times so it&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.419" end="00:30:43.889" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.200" end="00:30:47.789" style="s2">for those you know in cells yeah like to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.889" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">meet a woman like her who can kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.789" end="00:30:50.940" style="s2">okay you&#39;re not quite good enough to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:53.519" style="s2">full time boyfriend</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.940" end="00:30:55.859" style="s2">right but you have certain traits that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.519" end="00:30:58.349" style="s2">are enjoyable and here&#39;s how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.859" end="00:31:03.389" style="s2">cultivate your other traits and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.349" end="00:31:06.749" style="s2">that&#39;s a better path for those like SPS</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.389" end="00:31:09.049" style="s2">or in cells or whatever to to meet</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.749" end="00:31:12.539" style="s2">someone like her rather than to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.049" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">like meet a woman is saying okay you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.539" end="00:31:19.619" style="s2">a dysfunctional broken young man but</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:21.719" style="s2">you&#39;re the best I can get as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.619" end="00:31:25.879" style="s2">because I&#39;m also kind of just like</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.719" end="00:31:29.009" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not a good way forward</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.879" end="00:31:30.210" style="s2">okay yeah that&#39;s totally fair yet I and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.009" end="00:31:31.769" style="s2">I have done that I mean like this is why</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:36.029" style="s2">you take a loan on the date this is ya</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.769" end="00:31:37.469" style="s2">know and I and I and III like ASPI men</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.029" end="00:31:40.019" style="s2">cuz I like the way they think and I like</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.469" end="00:31:41.999" style="s2">that kind of systemising thing but also</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.019" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">I&#39;m very transparent my facial</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.999" end="00:31:45.839" style="s2">expressions are very transparent I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:49.019" style="s2">very clear about what I want and so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.839" end="00:31:50.909" style="s2">think that women can learn a lot and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.019" end="00:31:53.159" style="s2">aspies I mean now we&#39;re going on about</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.909" end="00:31:56.260" style="s2">talking about dating a space but they</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.260" end="00:31:59.100" style="s2">because they do want to make you happy</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.280" end="00:32:01.870" style="s2">they just don&#39;t know how to do it with</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.100" end="00:32:03.340" style="s2">unconscious or cues or reading facial</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.340" end="00:32:06.520" style="s2">somebody exactly what you want and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.810" end="00:32:08.110" style="s2">want to make you happy it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.520" end="00:32:09.970" style="s2">it&#39;s only when you have an expectation</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.110" end="00:32:11.410" style="s2">that somebody&#39;s going to infer what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.970" end="00:32:13.000" style="s2">want that you have these various</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.410" end="00:32:14.890" style="s2">different problems and if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.000" end="00:32:16.450" style="s2">figures out what a woman wants it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.890" end="00:32:18.040" style="s2">lot easier to figure out what other</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.450" end="00:32:20.770" style="s2">women want afterwards but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.040" end="00:32:22.390" style="s2">definitely I&#39;ve dated guys who I&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.770" end="00:32:24.130" style="s2">know never had a girlfriend before and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.390" end="00:32:25.870" style="s2">being like I actually can&#39;t be your</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.870" end="00:32:29.260" style="s2">is to go on four dates you tell me how</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.400" end="00:32:32.400" style="s2">they are and and I really love to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.260" end="00:32:34.750" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s not a chore at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.400" end="00:32:36.100" style="s2">famously Jordan Peterson got into</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.750" end="00:32:39.400" style="s2">trouble for talking about enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.100" end="00:32:41.800" style="s2">agha me and his point I think was that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.400" end="00:32:43.750" style="s2">monogamy evolved it&#39;s societally and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.800" end="00:32:47.550" style="s2">culturally enforced and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.750" end="00:32:49.870" style="s2">evolutionary trait so as evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.550" end="00:32:52.930" style="s2">psychologists are you not persuaded by</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.870" end="00:32:55.810" style="s2">the argument that monogamy has evolved</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.930" end="00:32:58.990" style="s2">time and time again in cultures as I</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.810" end="00:33:00.670" style="s2">kind of as a way of coping with with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.990" end="00:33:04.060" style="s2">pressures of life and a way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.670" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">furthering the species yeah so monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.060" end="00:33:09.070" style="s2">has been very important because the men</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:10.630" style="s2">who are the most likely to be violent</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:12.670" style="s2">and the most likely to cause problems in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.630" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">any given society are those men who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.670" end="00:33:17.320" style="s2">out of the mating game so men who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">have a wife or girlfriend or many times</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.320" end="00:33:22.150" style="s2">more likely to engage in homicide or</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:24.430" style="s2">really risky bad behavior one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.150" end="00:33:25.930" style="s2">best predictors of a young man cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.430" end="00:33:29.140" style="s2">his life up is actually him getting a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.930" end="00:33:32.170" style="s2">girlfriend or a wife for example and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.140" end="00:33:34.660" style="s2">young men who are unmated or who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.170" end="00:33:36.700" style="s2">have the faculties like the resources or</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.660" end="00:33:38.980" style="s2">whatever to get a long-term mate have</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.700" end="00:33:40.210" style="s2">always been dangerous in society and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.980" end="00:33:45.040" style="s2">what you&#39;ve seen is there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.210" end="00:33:47.410" style="s2">monogamy as a cultural beam that has</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.040" end="00:33:50.200" style="s2">enabled these men to each be assigned a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.410" end="00:33:52.420" style="s2">woman and thus it actually reduces the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.200" end="00:33:54.670" style="s2">kind of likelihood of insurgents for</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.420" end="00:33:56.620" style="s2">example so that does make sense right</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.670" end="00:33:58.660" style="s2">but what I think Jordan Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.620" end="00:33:59.770" style="s2">failing to understand is that if there</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.660" end="00:34:01.930" style="s2">were more people who are having open</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.770" end="00:34:04.330" style="s2">relationships and some young men for</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.930" end="00:34:05.990" style="s2">example who were not necessarily good</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.330" end="00:34:08.360" style="s2">material for a woman</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.990" end="00:34:11.270" style="s2">to date full-time but we&#39;re good enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.360" end="00:34:14.510" style="s2">for somebody or a couple women to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.270" end="00:34:17.750" style="s2">casually that guy I think is just as</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.510" end="00:34:20.300" style="s2">unlikely to engage in difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.750" end="00:34:23.720" style="s2">aggressive and criminal behavior as</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.300" end="00:34:27.980" style="s2">somebody who is married right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.720" end="00:34:30.110" style="s2">mean if a guy is really not good husband</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.980" end="00:34:33.860" style="s2">material and you kind of shoe him</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.110" end="00:34:35.510" style="s2">shoehorn him into husband role but kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.860" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">of against his wishes like he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.510" end="00:34:39.230" style="s2">just not really capable of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.460" end="00:34:43.100" style="s2">sexual commitment well you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.230" end="00:34:44.750" style="s2">asking is for some poor woman to fall on</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.100" end="00:34:47.149" style="s2">the sword for the greater good of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.750" end="00:34:50.570" style="s2">society to put up with this motherfucker</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.149" end="00:34:54.379" style="s2">and and like do the best she can with</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.570" end="00:34:56.419" style="s2">him whereas in a polyamorous society he</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.379" end="00:34:58.940" style="s2">might be able to find women who actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.419" end="00:35:01.670" style="s2">kind of like his dark streak or has bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.940" end="00:35:03.590" style="s2">bonus or the fact that he spends you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.670" end="00:35:05.560" style="s2">know three out of four weeks working on</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.590" end="00:35:08.510" style="s2">some oil rig somewhere or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.560" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">there&#39;s just more flexibility so just</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.510" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">the way that the free market with money</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:17.510" style="s2">is better than a barter economy right a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:20.900" style="s2">polyamorous society could be better for</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.510" end="00:35:24.290" style="s2">everybody in terms of exchanging sex and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.900" end="00:35:26.600" style="s2">romance than trying to fit everybody</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.290" end="00:35:28.580" style="s2">into this monogamous paradigm another</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.600" end="00:35:30.260" style="s2">thing that that people who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.580" end="00:35:32.930" style="s2">more traditionalist talk about a lot is</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.260" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2">about how if there were more polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.930" end="00:35:38.300" style="s2">people and there was more kind of casual</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:40.700" style="s2">non-exclusive negotiated relationships</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.300" end="00:35:42.740" style="s2">that fewer people would be have</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.700" end="00:35:45.830" style="s2">investing fathers right we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.740" end="00:35:49.190" style="s2">sure exactly how much a investing father</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.830" end="00:35:51.350" style="s2">figure is actually important so it does</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.190" end="00:35:53.300" style="s2">seem like it could be quite important</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.350" end="00:35:55.160" style="s2">but it also seems like men who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.300" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">likely to leave also have certain</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.160" end="00:36:00.230" style="s2">genetic qualities right they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:02.930" style="s2">more promiscuous they tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.230" end="00:36:04.730" style="s2">criminal for example and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.930" end="00:36:07.250" style="s2">hard to tease apart the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.730" end="00:36:09.050" style="s2">and the genetic effects so I know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.250" end="00:36:11.210" style="s2">some people think that if you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.050" end="00:36:13.369" style="s2">polyamory more popular that there would</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.210" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">be many fewer investing fathers in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.369" end="00:36:17.090" style="s2">picture but I think that the irony is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:19.070" style="s2">it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.090" end="00:36:21.170" style="s2">part the effects you do a large twin</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.070" end="00:36:23.630" style="s2">study and you can tease them apart and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.170" end="00:36:25.940" style="s2">what we find is in fact almost all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.630" end="00:36:27.800" style="s2">the traits that people say are due to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.940" end="00:36:30.200" style="s2">apps and fathers are actually heritable</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.800" end="00:36:33.440" style="s2">traits that are not much influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.200" end="00:36:35.570" style="s2">family structure so right the irony is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:38.330" style="s2">lot of the people who are saying we need</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.570" end="00:36:41.510" style="s2">monogamy because we need dads because we</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.330" end="00:36:43.910" style="s2">need role models and who you know in</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.510" end="00:36:46.040" style="s2">other contexts will be like you should</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.910" end="00:36:47.510" style="s2">never ignore the behavior genetics but</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.040" end="00:36:50.840" style="s2">in this domain they&#39;re ignoring the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.510" end="00:36:52.850" style="s2">behavior genetics and like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.840" end="00:36:55.310" style="s2">making a kind of blank slate argument</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.850" end="00:36:57.590" style="s2">that says it really really deeply</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.310" end="00:36:59.720" style="s2">matters that you have a stable family</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.590" end="00:37:02.870" style="s2">home or else the kid will grow up to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.720" end="00:37:05.240" style="s2">a terrible person it&#39;s like that is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.870" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">what the twin studies show and do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.240" end="00:37:11.900" style="s2">think you your typical in your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:13.970" style="s2">reactions or or is there something</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.900" end="00:37:15.980" style="s2">special about the way that you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.970" end="00:37:18.710" style="s2">able to approach it that that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.980" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">different to how most people approach</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.710" end="00:37:22.700" style="s2">their relationships that&#39;s why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:24.590" style="s2">think I often say I don&#39;t endorse</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.700" end="00:37:26.270" style="s2">polyamory like I don&#39;t endorse my</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.590" end="00:37:28.940" style="s2">particular relationship style I just</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.270" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">sort of endorse certain kind of tactics</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.940" end="00:37:33.560" style="s2">and I definitely need to get all this</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:35.780" style="s2">kind of down in blogs or on paper at</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.560" end="00:37:38.510" style="s2">some point but yeah I&#39;m really strange</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.780" end="00:37:41.170" style="s2">in many ways like I&#39;m unusual I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.510" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">you know neurotypical in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.170" end="00:37:47.540" style="s2">so I tend to not feel bad feelings for</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:49.130" style="s2">very long and I tend to have a even when</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.540" end="00:37:50.870" style="s2">I was a child I had quite a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.130" end="00:37:53.780" style="s2">utilitarian way of thinking about things</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.870" end="00:37:55.490" style="s2">so my view has always been if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.780" end="00:37:59.330" style="s2">distressed or I feel bad or I feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.490" end="00:38:01.130" style="s2">jealous if for example because of me</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.330" end="00:38:03.170" style="s2">being able to be stoical about those</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.130" end="00:38:05.300" style="s2">feelings or being able to manage those</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.170" end="00:38:07.970" style="s2">feelings Jeffery and somebody that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.300" end="00:38:09.220" style="s2">like especially somebody I like if</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.970" end="00:38:12.650" style="s2">they&#39;re enjoying each other&#39;s company</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.220" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">then I&#39;m actually doing something kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.650" end="00:38:16.700" style="s2">of for the greater good right I&#39;m and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.540" end="00:38:19.070" style="s2">and I think Jeffrey is wonderful so in</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.700" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">some sense I feel I was feel guilty</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.070" end="00:38:22.730" style="s2">monopolizing him entirely and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">actually very much the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.730" end="00:38:26.210" style="s2">utilitarian reasons that I think about</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">it and most people would not think about</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.210" end="00:38:29.539" style="s2">things that way and instead they would</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:32.329" style="s2">think about how</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.539" end="00:38:34.489" style="s2">they were maximizing their cues of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.329" end="00:38:37.279" style="s2">commitment and loyalty by acting</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.489" end="00:38:39.799" style="s2">incredibly jealously or by having a</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.279" end="00:38:41.209" style="s2">proprietary feeling about somebody so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.799" end="00:38:43.969" style="s2">think in that way I&#39;m unusual I have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.209" end="00:38:45.499" style="s2">very kind of high hedonic state I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.969" end="00:38:47.719" style="s2">happy all this - and basically what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.499" end="00:38:51.229" style="s2">trying to say yeah you&#39;re you&#39;re happy I</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.719" end="00:38:55.689" style="s2">think it helps that you&#39;re bisexual yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.229" end="00:38:58.130" style="s2">it helps a lot of asexual yeah so so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.689" end="00:38:59.419" style="s2">there&#39;s this concept that red pill</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.130" end="00:39:01.669" style="s2">people use a lot which is called</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.419" end="00:39:04.279" style="s2">hypergamy and hypergamy is a woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.669" end="00:39:06.559" style="s2">desire to be with a man who&#39;s higher and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.279" end="00:39:07.969" style="s2">status than than she is and you see this</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.559" end="00:39:09.289" style="s2">in romance novels all the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.969" end="00:39:11.149" style="s2">women who are with billionaires</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.289" end="00:39:13.669" style="s2">millionaires sheriff&#39;s Kings whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.149" end="00:39:15.889" style="s2">the case may be and so the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.669" end="00:39:18.229" style="s2">manage my jealousy to a great extent is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.889" end="00:39:21.109" style="s2">because I&#39;m attracted often to the women</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.229" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">that Jeffery sees and also because I</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.109" end="00:39:25.069" style="s2">think about him having high status the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:26.479" style="s2">best indicator of a man&#39;s status is how</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.069" end="00:39:29.569" style="s2">many women like him and desire him</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.479" end="00:39:32.479" style="s2">because women are really really good at</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.569" end="00:39:33.709" style="s2">sussing out how quality a man is so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.479" end="00:39:35.479" style="s2">Jeffery has other women who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.709" end="00:39:38.599" style="s2">interested in him it increases my</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.479" end="00:39:40.759" style="s2">perception of how good he is and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.599" end="00:39:42.829" style="s2">actually makes me feel really in love</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.759" end="00:39:45.469" style="s2">and excited about him right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.829" end="00:39:47.539" style="s2">kind of how I deal with it and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.469" end="00:39:49.789" style="s2">kind of a very primitive emotion like</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.539" end="00:39:53.659" style="s2">this you have status me watching the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.789" end="00:39:55.459" style="s2">different primitive but I really it has</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.659" end="00:39:58.069" style="s2">really good outcomes in terms of me</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.459" end="00:40:00.619" style="s2">manage my jealousy so i inflate that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.069" end="00:40:04.369" style="s2">emotion and I use it all the time in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.619" end="00:40:08.779" style="s2">order to enjoy whatever it is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.369" end="00:40:11.349" style="s2">negotiated yeah I&#39;m just a speii it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.779" end="00:40:15.589" style="s2">always I mean I&#39;m very rational and very</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.349" end="00:40:18.589" style="s2">systematizing I seek out principled</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.589" end="00:40:20.539" style="s2">solutions to issues things that make</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.589" end="00:40:25.819" style="s2">sense I hate inconsistency I hate</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.539" end="00:40:27.919" style="s2">hypocrisy and so it was very a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.819" end="00:40:30.019" style="s2">people in polyamory who were good at it</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.919" end="00:40:33.469" style="s2">I think have a little bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.019" end="00:40:35.689" style="s2">Asperger II sort of hyper rationality</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.469" end="00:40:37.339" style="s2">because they&#39;re willing to kind of take</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.689" end="00:40:39.530" style="s2">a step back from skate track of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.339" end="00:40:44.270" style="s2">calendars you go to be great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.530" end="00:40:45.740" style="s2">like systematizing and and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.270" end="00:40:49.400" style="s2">take a step back from your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.740" end="00:40:53.330" style="s2">monogamist background and think</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.400" end="00:40:56.660" style="s2">seriously about alternatives I think it</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.330" end="00:41:00.020" style="s2">helps to have a kind of experimental</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.660" end="00:41:02.570" style="s2">scientific attitude and a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.020" end="00:41:04.430" style="s2">epistemic humility also that says man I</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.570" end="00:41:07.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know we&#39;re just gonna try it out</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.430" end="00:41:09.650" style="s2">and see what happens and learn as we go</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.370" end="00:41:13.370" style="s2">and try to keep notes about what</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.650" end="00:41:15.110" style="s2">succeeds and fails yeah I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.370" end="00:41:17.870" style="s2">also sort of irreplaceable to each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.110" end="00:41:20.660" style="s2">this is gonna sound really romantic but</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.870" end="00:41:22.310" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to too soon basically we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.660" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">both really unusual in several different</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.310" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">ways right I actually tend to attract</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:29.810" style="s2">people who are a speii because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.310" style="s2">incredibly emotionally transparent and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.810" end="00:41:33.170" style="s2">my facial expressions very transparent</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.310" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t bother me to say exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.170" end="00:41:36.020" style="s2">what I want I think many women don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">want to say exactly what they want</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.020" end="00:41:39.890" style="s2">because part of the cue investment that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:42.770" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for is for somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.890" end="00:41:44.540" style="s2">use enough cognitive cycles to guess</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.770" end="00:41:47.360" style="s2">what they want so I think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.540" end="00:41:49.340" style="s2">big part of it but we are very unusually</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.360" end="00:41:51.350" style="s2">suited to one another and we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.340" end="00:41:53.030" style="s2">irreplaceable to one another so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.350" end="00:41:54.710" style="s2">why we can have a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.030" end="00:41:56.540" style="s2">relationship where I&#39;m not worried that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.710" end="00:41:58.850" style="s2">somebody&#39;s gonna replace me or that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.540" end="00:42:01.250" style="s2">anybody&#39;s going to replace him but most</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.850" end="00:42:02.630" style="s2">people if you look at tinder how would</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.250" end="00:42:03.950" style="s2">you know about somebody if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.630" end="00:42:05.720" style="s2">them on tinder you know that they live</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.950" end="00:42:07.940" style="s2">close by and you know what their face</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.720" end="00:42:09.710" style="s2">looks like maybe right but people get</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.940" end="00:42:11.480" style="s2">married with people that they meet on</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.710" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">tinder all the time back in the day</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.480" end="00:42:14.270" style="s2">people would get married to people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:16.580" style="s2">just lived around the corner so</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.270" end="00:42:18.380" style="s2">proximity and attraction are the main</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.580" end="00:42:19.720" style="s2">reasons that people get together not</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.380" end="00:42:22.580" style="s2">because they have any deep-seated</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.720" end="00:42:25.250" style="s2">interesting stuff in common or that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.580" end="00:42:28.070" style="s2">have unusual you know lifestyles or</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.250" end="00:42:29.720" style="s2">whatever the case may be so if two</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.070" end="00:42:31.100" style="s2">people all they have in common is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.720" end="00:42:32.600" style="s2">they&#39;re nice to each other and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.100" end="00:42:34.580" style="s2">attracted to each other they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.600" end="00:42:36.440" style="s2">infinitely replaceable by anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.580" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be very difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.440" end="00:42:40.040" style="s2">them to do hierarchical poly without</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:41.570" style="s2">somebody else you know coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.040" end="00:42:43.550" style="s2">taking people&#39;s places again and again</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.570" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">and again and that&#39;s what you see also</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.550" end="00:42:47.210" style="s2">in polyamorous communities a lot is this</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:48.860" style="s2">constant kind of switching of partners</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.210" end="00:42:50.660" style="s2">and the endless conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.860" end="00:42:52.380" style="s2">people have emotional conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.660" end="00:42:53.880" style="s2">I actually think that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.380" end="00:42:56.099" style="s2">like that I think that&#39;s why they do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.880" end="00:42:57.779" style="s2">otherwise or or they don&#39;t have anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.099" end="00:42:59.069" style="s2">else fulfilling in their lives so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.779" end="00:43:01.289" style="s2">something that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.069" end="00:43:03.420" style="s2">maximize another way that people can</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.289" end="00:43:04.920" style="s2">have unique things in common and you see</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.420" end="00:43:06.869" style="s2">this a lot it&#39;s somebody will be</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.920" end="00:43:08.160" style="s2">monogamous for a long time and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.869" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">they&#39;ll open up their relationship a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.160" end="00:43:11.400" style="s2">little bit and as Dan Savage says just</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:12.779" style="s2">because you open up your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.400" end="00:43:14.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you have to blow the door</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.779" end="00:43:15.960" style="s2">off its hinges right you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.369" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">relationship opened up a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.960" end="00:43:20.039" style="s2">there&#39;s this terrible bias unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.660" style="s2">in that you hear all the time about</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.039" end="00:43:23.430" style="s2">people who say we opened up our</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.660" end="00:43:25.470" style="s2">relationship everything went to shit and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.430" end="00:43:27.630" style="s2">now we&#39;re broken up you very rarely hear</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.470" end="00:43:29.759" style="s2">because so many people are on the down</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.630" end="00:43:31.470" style="s2">low or in the closet about having open</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.759" end="00:43:33.180" style="s2">relationships we decided to have an open</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.470" end="00:43:36.150" style="s2">relationship and everything worked out</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.180" end="00:43:37.230" style="s2">marvelously right and so yeah maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.150" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">the case that people open their</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.230" end="00:43:41.400" style="s2">relationships up and it&#39;s more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:43.049" style="s2">end badly but we wouldn&#39;t know because</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.400" end="00:43:45.359" style="s2">we have a completely biased sample we</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.049" end="00:43:46.680" style="s2">only hear about how open relationships</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.359" end="00:43:48.630" style="s2">screw things up because that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.680" end="00:43:54.150" style="s2">time we hear about people having opened</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.630" end="00:43:58.829" style="s2">up their relationship just like</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.150" end="00:44:02.009" style="s2">attention I think I think yeah we feel</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.829" end="00:44:03.630" style="s2">like it&#39;s important but also it is one</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.009" end="00:44:05.250" style="s2">way in which we use evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.630" end="00:44:07.619" style="s2">psychology in our day-to-day lives and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.250" end="00:44:10.799" style="s2">our knowledge about the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.619" end="00:44:14.579" style="s2">relationships I think it&#39;s important for</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.799" end="00:44:18.059" style="s2">people to have to be able to see couples</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.059" end="00:44:25.559" style="s2">sort of freaky California and New Age</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:28.430" style="s2">delusional like being able to do a open</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.559" end="00:44:31.019" style="s2">relationship and talk about it honestly</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.430" end="00:44:32.700" style="s2">it&#39;s pros and it&#39;s cons and why it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.019" end="00:44:35.339" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily work for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.700" end="00:44:36.089" style="s2">and not sort of proselytize it</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.339" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">recklessly</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.089" end="00:44:41.670" style="s2">I think that&#39;s really important because</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:43.980" style="s2">if folks like us are sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.670" end="00:44:46.500" style="s2">down-low and lie quietly doing open and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.980" end="00:44:49.980" style="s2">we&#39;re only letting the most extreme</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.500" end="00:44:52.260" style="s2">weird people show up on reality TV as</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.980" end="00:44:55.020" style="s2">like the exemplars apollyon</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.260" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">I think that&#39;s terrible right it would</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.020" end="00:44:59.250" style="s2">be like if the only examples of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:02.520" style="s2">monogamous marriage that you ever saw</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.250" end="00:45:06.839" style="s2">were just people fighting during divorce</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.520" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">court like that doesn&#39;t make monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.839" end="00:45:11.490" style="s2">look very good either</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:13.770" style="s2">you said proselytising then and I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.490" end="00:45:19.800" style="s2">that kind of links into what I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.770" end="00:45:21.720" style="s2">some people feel so triggered maybe by</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.800" end="00:45:23.609" style="s2">certain aspects of poly culture which</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.720" end="00:45:26.430" style="s2">kind of fear feels like people are sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.609" end="00:45:28.740" style="s2">of IVA evangelizing it and saying well</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.430" end="00:45:30.570" style="s2">it&#39;s the next evolutionary step there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.740" end="00:45:33.180" style="s2">this kind of it either implicit or</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.570" end="00:45:35.160" style="s2">explicit kind of sense of well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.180" end="00:45:37.740" style="s2">just not evolved enough if you were more</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.160" end="00:45:38.970" style="s2">evolved you would be poly and monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.740" end="00:45:41.970" style="s2">is something that we&#39;re going to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.970" end="00:45:43.589" style="s2">past you don&#39;t think what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.970" end="00:45:45.300" style="s2">that there is that sort of sense in some</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.589" end="00:45:48.770" style="s2">areas of the poly community oh yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.300" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">lot of them have have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.770" end="00:45:53.790" style="s2">progressive utopian cult that eventually</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:56.369" style="s2">like in a hundred years everyone will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.790" end="00:45:58.470" style="s2">enlightened and polyamorous now able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.369" end="00:45:59.190" style="s2">overcome their jealousy programming in</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.190" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">and and I think the percentage of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.720" end="00:46:08.190" style="s2">who are in successful poly and open</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.940" end="00:46:10.770" style="s2">relationships or swingers will increase</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.190" end="00:46:15.750" style="s2">it already is increasing especially</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.770" end="00:46:17.339" style="s2">among the other people but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.750" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">monogamous marriage is going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.339" end="00:46:23.790" style="s2">evaporate anytime soon it has many many</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:28.400" style="s2">benefits to individuals couples kids</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.790" end="00:46:30.780" style="s2">civilization etc my main concern is just</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.400" end="00:46:33.960" style="s2">create the broadest market that you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.780" end="00:46:36.450" style="s2">for for different mating systems be</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.250" end="00:46:45.960" style="s2">and then hopefully in a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.630" end="00:46:48.390" style="s2">generations will have a sort of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.960" end="00:46:50.579" style="s2">like these are the top three or four</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.390" end="00:46:53.369" style="s2">kinds of relationships that tend to work</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.579" end="00:46:54.660" style="s2">pretty well for most people and one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.369" end="00:46:56.820" style="s2">those might be monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.660" end="00:46:58.890" style="s2">marriage one of them probably will be</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.820" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">hierarchical Polly there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.890" end="00:47:02.760" style="s2">couple of others people in bet I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:05.310" style="s2">know I mean people have definitely said</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.760" end="00:47:06.570" style="s2">stuff about you know Twitter people</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.310" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">actually very really come after me on</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.570" end="00:47:10.170" style="s2">Twitter it&#39;s not an invitation by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:11.880" style="s2">way and they say it&#39;s kind of elitist</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.170" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">the way we say like oh you kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.880" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">to have very high emotional intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:19.190" style="s2">you have to be smart you have to be have</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:21.540" style="s2">a unique bond in order to be polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.190" end="00:47:24.030" style="s2">mostly I&#39;ve seen polyamorous people say</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.540" end="00:47:28.230" style="s2">that anybody can be polyamorous and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.030" end="00:47:30.210" style="s2">have followed some polyamorous groups</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.230" end="00:47:32.190" style="s2">and places like small cities in England</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.210" end="00:47:33.810" style="s2">to see all of the crazy drama that gets</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.190" end="00:47:36.150" style="s2">kicked up there because people are</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.810" end="00:47:37.800" style="s2">managing relationships without any kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.150" end="00:47:41.370" style="s2">of understanding of human nature I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.800" end="00:47:44.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s important I think to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.370" end="00:47:45.840" style="s2">it but I also think it&#39;s important for</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.490" end="00:47:48.810" style="s2">people to be able to evaluate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.840" end="00:47:50.280" style="s2">and for some people to say no I really</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.810" end="00:47:53.250" style="s2">want to be monogamous with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.280" end="00:47:55.770" style="s2">long-term but to consider actually that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.250" end="00:47:58.170" style="s2">both men and women have desire for</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.770" end="00:47:59.430" style="s2">sexual and romantic variety that wanting</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.170" end="00:48:00.750" style="s2">to have sex with somebody else doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.430" end="00:48:02.610" style="s2">necessarily mean that you&#39;ve fallen out</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.750" end="00:48:06.540" style="s2">of love with the person that you&#39;re with</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.610" end="00:48:08.310" style="s2">and also to examine how this this very</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.540" end="00:48:10.140" style="s2">isolated culture that we&#39;ve put together</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.310" end="00:48:12.570" style="s2">where people don&#39;t live in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.140" end="00:48:14.850" style="s2">communal way where they live really you</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.570" end="00:48:17.460" style="s2">know isolated from everyone else about</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.850" end="00:48:20.130" style="s2">how that&#39;s also contributing to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.460" end="00:48:22.050" style="s2">monogamous culture where people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.130" end="00:48:24.870" style="s2">really starving for even outside</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.050" end="00:48:27.690" style="s2">friendship and I think one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.870" end="00:48:29.820" style="s2">polyamory does is because you know when</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.690" end="00:48:31.800" style="s2">you have lovers or friends who are also</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.820" end="00:48:34.320" style="s2">sometimes lovers you actually just</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.800" end="00:48:38.220" style="s2">develop closer bonds with them and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.320" end="00:48:40.770" style="s2">helped me have a much more whatever I</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.220" end="00:48:42.330" style="s2">think clothes expanded network than</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.770" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">people I know who are monogamous and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.330" end="00:48:45.810" style="s2">that&#39;s nothing a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:47.370" style="s2">people people who go to church tend to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.810" end="00:48:49.650" style="s2">be happier than people who don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.370" end="00:48:50.970" style="s2">also people in unique sexual subcultures</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.650" end="00:48:53.130" style="s2">tend to be happier in their</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.970" end="00:48:55.410" style="s2">relationships because they&#39;re extended</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.130" end="00:48:57.390" style="s2">network has this this pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.410" end="00:49:00.270" style="s2">component which knits them together more</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.390" end="00:49:00.869" style="s2">tightly than other kinds of groups would</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.270" end="00:49:06.299" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.869" end="00:49:08.390" style="s2">together I saw Brett Weinstein tweet the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.299" end="00:49:10.950" style="s2">other day saying so he&#39;s a skeptic about</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.390" end="00:49:13.529" style="s2">polyamory but he said if anyone can pull</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.950" end="00:49:15.089" style="s2">this off then Jeffrey and Diana can pull</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.529" end="00:49:16.529" style="s2">it off I think someone else novella</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.089" end="00:49:21.329" style="s2">bellows but we&#39;ll do that you say that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.529" end="00:49:22.529" style="s2">too so that&#39;s kind so if you can&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.329" end="00:49:23.969" style="s2">I guess nobody can</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.529" end="00:49:27.210" style="s2">are you comfortable holding that much</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.969" end="00:49:29.099" style="s2">responsibility no I mean no because life</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.210" end="00:49:31.410" style="s2">is stochastic and like we could fuck it</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.099" end="00:49:34.979" style="s2">up and hopefully we won&#39;t yeah but we</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.410" end="00:49:36.989" style="s2">couldn&#39;t fuck it up and this is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.979" end="00:49:38.940" style="s2">so important to have a wider variety of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.989" end="00:49:41.369" style="s2">people kind of coming out and saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.940" end="00:49:44.999" style="s2">we&#39;re swingers were open or poly and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.369" end="00:49:48.869" style="s2">people who like actually have like paid</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.999" end="00:49:50.579" style="s2">jobs and not and who don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.869" end="00:49:52.469" style="s2">live in Southern California and who</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.579" end="00:49:55.079" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily just hang out with</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.469" end="00:49:56.940" style="s2">other Burning Man people to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.079" end="00:49:58.859" style="s2">normalize it right the way that gay and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.940" end="00:50:02.190" style="s2">lesbian culture got normalized in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.859" end="00:50:05.519" style="s2">90s with like sitcoms that showed oh you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.190" end="00:50:10.380" style="s2">can be gay and employed right and in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.519" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">committed relationship and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.380" end="00:50:16.109" style="s2">know it&#39;s very kind for for folks to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:19.499" style="s2">well if we two can&#39;t succeed nobody can</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.109" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s not like we have some weird</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.499" end="00:50:24.569" style="s2">poly superpower it&#39;s just that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">smart people who&#39;ve worked really hard</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.569" end="00:50:29.279" style="s2">to get in touch with our emotions who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:31.259" style="s2">learned all we can about poly culture</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.279" end="00:50:34.680" style="s2">who have the appropriate degree of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.259" end="00:50:38.489" style="s2">skepticism about it and to have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.680" end="00:50:40.710" style="s2">and abiding respect for tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.489" end="00:50:43.229" style="s2">monogamy and marriage and don&#39;t just</p>

<p begin="00:50:43.229" end="00:50:50.069" style="s2">like like polyamory to me like might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.249" end="00:50:52.589" style="s2">30% better than monogamous marriage but</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.069" end="00:50:56.579" style="s2">it&#39;s not like eight thousand percent</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.589" end="00:50:58.680" style="s2">better yeah and I do think that it you</p>
