<p begin="00:01:23.530" end="00:01:29.960" style="s2">now first of all professor Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.080" end="00:01:32.150" style="s2">welcome how are you good nice to be here</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.960" end="00:01:35.210" style="s2">great could you please tell us a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.150" end="00:01:37.460" style="s2">first of all about your background well</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.210" end="00:01:40.790" style="s2">I&#39;m a clinical psychologist trained at</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.460" end="00:01:44.270" style="s2">McGill University I&#39;ve been working as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.790" end="00:01:45.800" style="s2">professor since 1992 I taught at Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.270" end="00:01:48.860" style="s2">University in the psychology department</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.800" end="00:01:52.870" style="s2">for six years and then I moved to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.860" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">Toronto and I&#39;ve been here since 19 1998</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.870" end="00:02:00.110" style="s2">I also do consulting work for a variety</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:04.460" style="s2">of different companies now that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.110" end="00:02:08.119" style="s2">you&#39;re currently working on now probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.460" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">the most widely read book on psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.119" end="00:02:14.510" style="s2">for the novice reader was Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:16.820" style="s2">masterpiece man and his symbols are you</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.510" end="00:02:20.750" style="s2">approaching a general audience with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.820" end="00:02:23.660" style="s2">book or your book maps of meaning or is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.750" end="00:02:26.330" style="s2">this more suited to the student of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.660" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">psychology well I think it&#39;s suited for</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.330" end="00:02:32.630" style="s2">people who would like a book like man</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.790" end="00:02:34.310" style="s2">and his symbols and Jung&#39;s books even</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.630" end="00:02:37.250" style="s2">the ones that were written for a general</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.310" end="00:02:38.570" style="s2">audience were not particularly simple</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.250" end="00:02:41.000" style="s2">because they&#39;re so different in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.570" end="00:02:42.739" style="s2">conception but I would say maps of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.000" end="00:02:46.370" style="s2">meaning is aimed at the same audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.739" end="00:02:49.459" style="s2">that those books were aimed at now</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.370" end="00:02:52.940" style="s2">they&#39;re similar to two books by Eric</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.459" end="00:02:55.640" style="s2">Newman who was a very astute student of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.940" end="00:02:58.760" style="s2">Jung&#39;s and who took gills thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.640" end="00:03:01.459" style="s2">farther in some directions than Jung</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.760" end="00:03:04.670" style="s2">himself had so I guess I see my work in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.459" end="00:03:07.670" style="s2">part as an extension of Jung&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.670" end="00:03:10.670" style="s2">Newman&#39;s work partly into the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.670" end="00:03:12.830" style="s2">neuropsychology and of course you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.670" end="00:03:17.410" style="s2">say that you&#39;ve led on from the workers</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.830" end="00:03:19.930" style="s2">of luminaries such as look when we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.410" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">Stein with his book philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.930" end="00:03:25.810" style="s2">investigations in 1953 for instance</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:29.020" style="s2">where again he attempted to lay out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.810" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">apparent structure of the mind and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.020" end="00:03:32.440" style="s2">conditioning with cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">historical variables would that be true</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.440" end="00:03:36.550" style="s2">to say you&#39;ve moved on from that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.360" end="00:03:39.430" style="s2">expanded it even more one of it contains</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:43.570" style="s2">contributions was the idea that a word</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.430" end="00:03:45.670" style="s2">was more like a piece in a chess game</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.570" end="00:03:49.030" style="s2">than it was like a label for an object</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.670" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">and prefer Wittgenstein&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.030" end="00:03:54.330" style="s2">words were always to do things with</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:57.400" style="s2">rather than to label things with and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.330" end="00:04:00.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a conception that I share because</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.400" end="00:04:01.780" style="s2">most of our concepts scientists like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.070" end="00:04:03.910" style="s2">think that our concepts are very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.780" end="00:04:07.420" style="s2">like theories about objects but in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.910" end="00:04:09.640" style="s2">reality our concepts are much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.420" end="00:04:12.310" style="s2">action-oriented than that I mean we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.640" end="00:04:15.940" style="s2">for example that when you look at even a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.310" end="00:04:18.519" style="s2">simple object like a cup the brain areas</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.940" end="00:04:21.160" style="s2">that are involved in motor action are</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.519" end="00:04:23.290" style="s2">activated at the level of perception so</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.160" end="00:04:25.420" style="s2">for example when you look at a cup the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.290" end="00:04:28.140" style="s2">gripping action that your hand would</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.420" end="00:04:31.270" style="s2">make if you lifted up the cup is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.140" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">partially activated merely when your</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:37.090" style="s2">eyes settle on the cup itself so an</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:38.860" style="s2">Vidkun Stein was the first philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:40.390" style="s2">although Nietzsche knew this to some</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.860" end="00:04:42.130" style="s2">degree to that consent was the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.390" end="00:04:45.010" style="s2">philosopher to really point out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.130" end="00:04:49.270" style="s2">functional quality of our object</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.010" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">categories and my work overlaps with his</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.270" end="00:04:55.720" style="s2">ideas to some degree because uh one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:59.110" style="s2">my preconceptions is that mythological</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.720" end="00:05:01.660" style="s2">ideals ideas and concepts are functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.110" end="00:05:03.910" style="s2">they&#39;re to do things with their to act</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.660" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">about they&#39;re not to label they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.910" end="00:05:09.190" style="s2">descriptive like a scientific concept is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:11.380" style="s2">that&#39;s why religious mythology has to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.190" end="00:05:14.860" style="s2">with morality because morality is about</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.380" end="00:05:18.100" style="s2">action in psychology what role does the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.860" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">study of myth and symbols play and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.100" end="00:05:22.540" style="s2">is the relationship to human</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">consciousness in say the treatment of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.540" end="00:05:28.270" style="s2">mental illness for instance or what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:31.220" style="s2">class or classify in the Western concept</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.270" end="00:05:35.240" style="s2">as mental illness well let&#39;s let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.220" end="00:05:36.440" style="s2">the first question about dreams I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.240" end="00:05:38.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of debate in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.440" end="00:05:39.980" style="s2">scientific literature about the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.840" end="00:05:42.170" style="s2">of dreams</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.980" end="00:05:44.060" style="s2">and perhaps there&#39;s even debate about</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.170" end="00:05:48.140" style="s2">whether it&#39;s possible for dreams to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.060" end="00:05:51.610" style="s2">meaning I think partly the debate exists</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.140" end="00:05:54.980" style="s2">because to do dream analysis properly as</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.610" end="00:05:59.330" style="s2">Union particular point it out you need a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.980" end="00:06:01.580" style="s2">vast body of knowledge in the dream</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.330" end="00:06:05.390" style="s2">interpreter about comparative mythology</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.580" end="00:06:08.840" style="s2">and ritual and symbol and and art</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.390" end="00:06:11.960" style="s2">history and so forth because dreams of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.840" end="00:06:16.640" style="s2">course use images as their primary means</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.960" end="00:06:18.890" style="s2">of conceptualization now in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.640" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">understand what what dreams mean and how</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.890" end="00:06:24.650" style="s2">they can be useful in therapy apart from</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:27.290" style="s2">appreciating the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.650" end="00:06:29.210" style="s2">interpreter needs a broad body of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.290" end="00:06:31.580" style="s2">knowledge that scientists generally</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.210" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">don&#39;t develop it&#39;s also important to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.580" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">know what it is that scientists have</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:39.830" style="s2">discovered about dreams so for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:43.910" style="s2">we know that dreams occur during rapid</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.830" end="00:06:45.710" style="s2">eye movement sleep you cycle into rapid</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.910" end="00:06:49.430" style="s2">eye movement sleep about every 90</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.710" end="00:06:53.030" style="s2">minutes when you&#39;re asleep when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:55.610" style="s2">in rapid eye movement sleep your motor</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.030" end="00:06:57.410" style="s2">centers so your action centers are very</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.610" end="00:06:59.780" style="s2">much activated in your brain but your</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.410" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">body is paralyzed so that you can&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.780" end="00:07:05.630" style="s2">around your eyes are moving because of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:07.700" style="s2">course it doesn&#39;t really matter if your</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.630" end="00:07:09.410" style="s2">eyes move while you&#39;re asleep because</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.700" end="00:07:10.790" style="s2">they won&#39;t take you anywhere but if your</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.410" end="00:07:13.130" style="s2">legs were moving while you were asleep</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.790" end="00:07:16.120" style="s2">you run into walls while you were</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.130" end="00:07:21.110" style="s2">dreaming and scientists have actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.120" end="00:07:23.750" style="s2">managed to damage the motor inhibition</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.750" end="00:07:30.350" style="s2">around when they&#39;re dreaming anyways if</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.490" end="00:07:32.090" style="s2">you wake up when someone&#39;s dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:33.740" style="s2">their brain is about as active as it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.090" end="00:07:35.540" style="s2">when they&#39;re awake so there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:45.620" style="s2">about an 80% chance that they&#39;ll report</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.770" end="00:07:47.870" style="s2">the emotion of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.620" end="00:07:53.060" style="s2">dreams tend to focus on threat</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.870" end="00:07:55.790" style="s2">processing now a threat is anything that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.060" end="00:07:57.410" style="s2">might hurt you but it&#39;s more than that -</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.790" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">a threat is anything that doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.410" end="00:08:01.730" style="s2">into your current conceptual scheme you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:04.550" style="s2">imagine that you have a theory about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.730" end="00:08:06.710" style="s2">way the world is and then you act on</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.550" end="00:08:08.390" style="s2">that theory and sometimes things work</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:11.300" style="s2">out the way you&#39;d like them to work out</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.390" end="00:08:14.180" style="s2">but often they don&#39;t and every time</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.300" end="00:08:16.610" style="s2">things work out in a way that isn&#39;t how</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.180" end="00:08:19.310" style="s2">you would like or how you predicted that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.610" end="00:08:21.020" style="s2">indicates that there&#39;s some more about</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.310" end="00:08:25.400" style="s2">the world that you have to learn about</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.020" end="00:08:29.480" style="s2">and that fact first manifests itself in</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.400" end="00:08:33.650" style="s2">anxiety now the dream focuses on anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.480" end="00:08:35.930" style="s2">and then it loosens up it&#39;s the normal</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.650" end="00:08:40.670" style="s2">conceptual constraints that characterize</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.930" end="00:08:44.360" style="s2">waking thinking and it starts to play in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.670" end="00:08:46.220" style="s2">a sense or hypothesize about how your</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.360" end="00:08:48.920" style="s2">current categorical structure could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.220" end="00:08:50.230" style="s2">shifted around so that that threat could</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.920" end="00:08:53.750" style="s2">be accounted for</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.230" end="00:08:55.700" style="s2">okay now that means the dream is dealing</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.750" end="00:08:59.270" style="s2">with things that you need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.700" end="00:09:01.250" style="s2">but you don&#39;t yet understand so when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:02.780" style="s2">wake up and you remember the dream the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.250" end="00:09:04.100" style="s2">dream doesn&#39;t really make sense because</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.780" end="00:09:04.970" style="s2">it&#39;s about something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.100" end="00:09:08.650" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.970" end="00:09:10.820" style="s2">now it&#39;s your brains best guess at</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.650" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">configuring or understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.820" end="00:09:16.040" style="s2">unknowable but it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:18.710" style="s2">the first layer of a multi-layered</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.040" end="00:09:22.310" style="s2">process which eventually would culminate</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.710" end="00:09:24.380" style="s2">in fully developed thought maybe over</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.310" end="00:09:26.750" style="s2">months or maybe over years or maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.380" end="00:09:28.700" style="s2">would never manage it at all the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.750" end="00:09:30.440" style="s2">thing or the threat is just too great to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:32.930" style="s2">really come to any terms with it</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.440" end="00:09:35.240" style="s2">whatsoever okay now I imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.930" end="00:09:37.820" style="s2">you&#39;re dreaming about something and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.240" end="00:09:39.560" style="s2">produces enough emotion what the threat</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.820" end="00:09:41.720" style="s2">produces enough emotion not only to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.560" end="00:09:44.090" style="s2">produce a very vivid dream but to wake</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.720" end="00:09:46.310" style="s2">you up when you wake up you remember the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.090" end="00:09:49.070" style="s2">dream and then you will tell someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.310" end="00:09:50.960" style="s2">about it well the dream is about</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.070" end="00:09:53.510" style="s2">something you don&#39;t yet understand that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.960" end="00:09:54.830" style="s2">that&#39;s upsetting and if you tell a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.510" end="00:09:57.270" style="s2">of people about it they&#39;re going to give</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.830" end="00:09:58.860" style="s2">you all sorts of opinions on the dream</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.270" end="00:10:00.810" style="s2">that&#39;s a way that you can gather more</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.860" end="00:10:03.780" style="s2">information about the threat are we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.810" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2">talking about an extreme case which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.780" end="00:10:09.810" style="s2">known as a nightmare or perhaps simply a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.360" end="00:10:12.540" style="s2">dream which is faintly troubling all</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.810" end="00:10:14.250" style="s2">puzzling because it&#39;s so abstract could</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.540" end="00:10:15.780" style="s2">you differentiate between I think I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.250" end="00:10:18.270" style="s2">think it&#39;s clearer in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.780" end="00:10:19.950" style="s2">nightmares and often too because</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.270" end="00:10:22.710" style="s2">nightmares tend to have archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.950" end="00:10:24.450" style="s2">themes you know people for example are</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.710" end="00:10:27.090" style="s2">often threatened by monsters in</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.450" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">nightmares and a monster is a chimera</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.090" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">that&#39;s made up of the different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.240" end="00:10:35.160" style="s2">different parts of frightening things a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:38.370" style="s2">dragon is a chimera for example because</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.160" end="00:10:41.280" style="s2">it&#39;s made out of reptilian parts and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.370" end="00:10:45.960" style="s2">also includes the idea of fire and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.280" end="00:10:48.330" style="s2">transformation so a nightmare is a dream</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.960" end="00:10:50.910" style="s2">that tends to use archetypal imagery to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.330" end="00:10:55.140" style="s2">conceptualize a fairly powerful threat</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.910" end="00:10:57.540" style="s2">and if you recount a nightmare to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.140" end="00:10:59.490" style="s2">person with no specific training they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.540" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">going to have some opinion about it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.490" end="00:11:04.230" style="s2">their opinion might be useful in terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:05.840" style="s2">of information catherine but if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.230" end="00:11:07.710" style="s2">recount a dream to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.840" end="00:11:10.020" style="s2">psychologically trained and is also</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.710" end="00:11:12.150" style="s2">symbolically trained and who has you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.020" end="00:11:14.310" style="s2">know great great depth of knowledge with</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.150" end="00:11:16.220" style="s2">regards to the structure of religious</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.310" end="00:11:18.840" style="s2">thinking and and comparative literature</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.220" end="00:11:21.570" style="s2">the light that they&#39;re going to shed on</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.840" end="00:11:25.580" style="s2">your dream is much brighter and and more</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.570" end="00:11:27.960" style="s2">profound and sometimes a dream</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.580" end="00:11:30.990" style="s2">interpretation can offer the person</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.960" end="00:11:32.430" style="s2">who&#39;s had the dream a leap forward in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.990" end="00:11:34.740" style="s2">knowledge that might have taken them</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.430" end="00:11:37.110" style="s2">five or six years to conceptualize by</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.740" end="00:11:40.530" style="s2">themselves an insight you might say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.110" end="00:11:43.290" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t normally have had because</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.530" end="00:11:45.720" style="s2">the person who&#39;s the expert who&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.290" end="00:11:48.300" style="s2">the dream recounted to them knows and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.720" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">says ah yes I know of that place that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.300" end="00:11:53.220" style="s2">they say they&#39;ve been to that experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:11:56.520" style="s2">they&#39;ve had that symbol and it&#39;s meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.220" end="00:11:59.850" style="s2">and above all what it feels like because</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.520" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">surely it is some people say that me</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.850" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">included that one way to interpret a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">dream when you wake up is to just like</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:11.070" style="s2">you would taste a sip of wine just hold</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:14.460" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.070" end="00:12:15.240" style="s2">flavor and hold the feeling what does it</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.460" end="00:12:17.010" style="s2">feel like</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.240" end="00:12:18.930" style="s2">and what does fear what feels the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.010" end="00:12:20.130" style="s2">in your real life and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.930" end="00:12:24.780" style="s2">dream is trying to tell you with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.130" end="00:12:28.430" style="s2">collage of symbols and memories as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.780" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s drawn on in recent conscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.430" end="00:12:32.460" style="s2">experience to try and put it together</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:33.950" style="s2">hence the dream can be very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.460" end="00:12:36.630" style="s2">would you say that&#39;s the case sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.950" end="00:12:39.150" style="s2">well I think there&#39;s two things about</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.630" end="00:12:42.990" style="s2">about your comments that are are really</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.150" end="00:12:45.090" style="s2">worth highlighting the first is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.990" end="00:12:47.910" style="s2">category is that a dream uses are</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.090" end="00:12:50.610" style="s2">generally based on emotional similarity</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.910" end="00:12:53.970" style="s2">rather than logical similarity yes so a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.610" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">dream for example might represent fear</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.970" end="00:12:59.400" style="s2">or the fear of something unknown by</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:02.310" style="s2">using a juxtaposition of a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.400" end="00:13:04.020" style="s2">images of frightening things so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.310" end="00:13:06.360" style="s2">that in the dream world the basic rule</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.020" end="00:13:08.730" style="s2">is all things that produce the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.360" end="00:13:13.380" style="s2">emotion are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.730" end="00:13:15.780" style="s2">and so your description of a dream</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.380" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">interpretation process that relies on</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.780" end="00:13:21.450" style="s2">identifying similarities in emotional</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:24.840" style="s2">state gets right to the core of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.450" end="00:13:28.350" style="s2">dream thought works now secondarily I</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.840" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">also believe that if you are able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.350" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">help someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.190" end="00:13:36.300" style="s2">construct a dream interpretation that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.660" end="00:13:39.690" style="s2">fits they&#39;re also able to feel that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.300" end="00:13:41.720" style="s2">fits it clicks or it makes sense or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.690" end="00:13:44.520" style="s2">like the punchline of a joke in some way</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.720" end="00:13:47.730" style="s2">they can tell that the interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.520" end="00:13:50.460" style="s2">has put some missing pieces of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.730" end="00:13:52.170" style="s2">puzzle into place and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.460" end="00:13:54.270" style="s2">important to rely on that as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.170" end="00:13:57.690" style="s2">indicator of whether the interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.270" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">is actually derived from the dream or</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.690" end="00:14:02.640" style="s2">sort of just a theoretical imposition on</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:04.710" style="s2">its structure now we can go underneath</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.640" end="00:14:07.050" style="s2">that too and and I mentioned already</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.710" end="00:14:10.260" style="s2">that basic categories are more</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.050" end="00:14:12.690" style="s2">action-oriented than object-oriented so</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.260" end="00:14:15.240" style="s2">basic categories the basic categories of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.690" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2">the human mind are categories to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.240" end="00:14:20.330" style="s2">things with well by the same token there</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:23.790" style="s2">are also motivational and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.330" end="00:14:24.900" style="s2">categories so the primordial mind like</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.790" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">the animal mind</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.900" end="00:14:30.450" style="s2">thinks sort of axiomatically that all</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">things that produce the same emotion are</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.450" end="00:14:34.890" style="s2">the same thing so there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:36.870" style="s2">make you happy or there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.890" end="00:14:39.450" style="s2">make you sad or there&#39;s things that make</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.870" end="00:14:41.670" style="s2">you anxious and the fact that all those</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.450" end="00:14:45.660" style="s2">things share the capacity to evoke that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.670" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">emotion speaks of some ESET essential</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.660" end="00:14:50.910" style="s2">identity between them now the identity</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:53.700" style="s2">is in relationship to the experiencer</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.910" end="00:14:56.700" style="s2">and not necessarily with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.700" end="00:14:58.950" style="s2">similarity between the objects but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.700" end="00:15:02.190" style="s2">still how we naturally think and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.950" end="00:15:04.890" style="s2">certainly how mythology thinks and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.190" end="00:15:07.050" style="s2">how drama thinks and how religion thinks</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.890" end="00:15:08.640" style="s2">and we&#39;ve lost sight of that in part</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.050" end="00:15:10.710" style="s2">because we&#39;ve become scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.640" end="00:15:12.570" style="s2">trained to some degree and we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.710" end="00:15:16.200" style="s2">believe that the real categories of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.570" end="00:15:18.540" style="s2">world are objective and alright that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.200" end="00:15:20.190" style="s2">that just strikes me as it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.540" end="00:15:22.650" style="s2">there&#39;s something about it that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.190" end="00:15:25.140" style="s2">and it&#39;s wrong because we have to act</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.650" end="00:15:27.540" style="s2">sure there&#39;s something missing there</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.140" end="00:15:30.450" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ve lost it along the way going</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.540" end="00:15:33.660" style="s2">back to emotional reactions people call</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.450" end="00:15:38.010" style="s2">them knee-jerk response for instance if</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.660" end="00:15:40.339" style="s2">you take the base emotions she only one</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.010" end="00:15:43.110" style="s2">could go way way back to the dawn of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.339" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">beginnings when we came down from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.110" end="00:15:48.120" style="s2">trees and move through the forest out</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:51.800" style="s2">onto the plains under gatherers and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.120" end="00:15:54.690" style="s2">animals do share this with us because</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.800" end="00:15:58.589" style="s2">the everyday dog and cat does have</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.690" end="00:16:01.830" style="s2">emotions our emotions born out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.589" end="00:16:03.690" style="s2">originally just pure instinct is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.830" end="00:16:07.800" style="s2">where emotions came from do you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.690" end="00:16:11.160" style="s2">because instinct causes reaction you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.800" end="00:16:13.950" style="s2">have the old adage of fight or flight</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.160" end="00:16:16.700" style="s2">for instance depending on what you make</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.950" end="00:16:21.290" style="s2">a decision to do okay so let&#39;s make a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.700" end="00:16:25.260" style="s2">conceptual definition here so that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.290" end="00:16:29.670" style="s2">agree on the terminology let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.260" end="00:16:32.760" style="s2">motivations are states of being that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.670" end="00:16:35.339" style="s2">indicate a goal that are indicative of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.760" end="00:16:37.290" style="s2">goal so for example if you get hungry I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.339" end="00:16:38.490" style="s2">would say that&#39;s a motivational state</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.290" end="00:16:41.160" style="s2">rather than an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.490" end="00:16:43.470" style="s2">State and it&#39;s a motivational state that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.160" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">sets the acquisition and ingestion of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.470" end="00:16:48.060" style="s2">food as the goal all right and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:54.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a variety of motivational states</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.060" end="00:16:56.279" style="s2">hunger thirst sexual desire generation</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.779" end="00:16:59.970" style="s2">especially defensive aggression</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.279" end="00:17:03.630" style="s2">predatory aggression and the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.970" end="00:17:06.030" style="s2">eliminate essentially the desire to play</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.630" end="00:17:08.670" style="s2">those are all motivational states and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.030" end="00:17:10.380" style="s2">then there&#39;s emotional states and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.670" end="00:17:13.140" style="s2">primary emotional states are positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.380" end="00:17:15.300" style="s2">and negative and positive emotional</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.140" end="00:17:17.720" style="s2">states are experienced when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.300" end="00:17:21.540" style="s2">moving towards a desired goal and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.720" end="00:17:25.380" style="s2">negative emotional states occur when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.540" end="00:17:28.610" style="s2">goal becomes uncertain or the pursuit is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.380" end="00:17:31.559" style="s2">somehow frustrated or or interfered with</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.610" end="00:17:33.450" style="s2">okay now you asked about instincts well</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.559" end="00:17:36.809" style="s2">I would say both motivations and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.450" end="00:17:37.890" style="s2">emotions are instincts they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.809" end="00:17:40.650" style="s2">archaic</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.890" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">if you think about the positive and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.650" end="00:17:47.130" style="s2">negative emotions as being approach</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:49.559" style="s2">versus withdrawal animals going all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.130" end="00:17:52.770" style="s2">way back to single-celled organisms have</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.559" end="00:17:55.650" style="s2">approached versus withdrawal symptoms so</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.770" end="00:18:00.140" style="s2">they&#39;re unbelievably archaic they go way</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.650" end="00:18:05.429" style="s2">back before we split evolutionarily from</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.140" end="00:18:07.940" style="s2">our chimpanzee like ancestors so they</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.429" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">are instinct and they&#39;re very deep and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.940" end="00:18:14.970" style="s2">they the fact that those instincts exist</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:16.710" style="s2">has all sorts of strange and that their</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.970" end="00:18:19.620" style="s2">evolutionary based have all has all</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.710" end="00:18:22.260" style="s2">sorts of strange implications so for</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.620" end="00:18:23.910" style="s2">example you can understand the dog and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.260" end="00:18:25.740" style="s2">communicate with a dog because the dog</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.910" end="00:18:28.110" style="s2">shares motivational and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.740" end="00:18:30.270" style="s2">structure with you to great degree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.110" end="00:18:32.970" style="s2">a pack animal it knows about dominance</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.270" end="00:18:37.710" style="s2">it knows about dominance striving it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.970" end="00:18:40.110" style="s2">feels anxiety and pain and it knows how</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.710" end="00:18:41.850" style="s2">to play and it likes to play and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.110" end="00:18:43.410" style="s2">a lot about a human being and the dog</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.850" end="00:18:45.900" style="s2">they&#39;re the same which is why we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.410" end="00:18:49.260" style="s2">live together but you can go way down</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.900" end="00:18:51.410" style="s2">the evolutionary chain so say if you go</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.260" end="00:18:52.970" style="s2">all the way down to lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.410" end="00:18:55.910" style="s2">lobsters know about dominance</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.970" end="00:18:58.670" style="s2">hierarchies and they have approach and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.910" end="00:19:00.740" style="s2">withdrawal systems and the lobster</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.670" end="00:19:02.810" style="s2">nervous system which is very primitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.740" end="00:19:06.260" style="s2">compared to the human nervous system is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.810" end="00:19:09.650" style="s2">so similar to ours that you can give</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.260" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">lobsters antidepressants and it stops</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.650" end="00:19:14.120" style="s2">them from feeling hurt after they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:16.130" style="s2">been defeated in a physical dominance</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.120" end="00:19:18.890" style="s2">dispute is that right yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.130" end="00:19:22.250" style="s2">absolutely amazing so typically if two</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.890" end="00:19:26.300" style="s2">lobsters are in a dominus dispute and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.250" end="00:19:29.510" style="s2">one loses it will withdraw and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.300" end="00:19:31.810" style="s2">it&#39;ll it kind of folds its body up it it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.510" end="00:19:34.550" style="s2">goes into a depressed like Crouch</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.810" end="00:19:36.650" style="s2">whereas the winner will expand his body</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.550" end="00:19:38.870" style="s2">and look bigger okay and when the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.650" end="00:19:40.970" style="s2">lobster is defeated it won&#39;t fight with</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.870" end="00:19:42.830" style="s2">any other lobster for at least 20</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.970" end="00:19:44.740" style="s2">minutes even one of it had defeated</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.830" end="00:19:46.910" style="s2">before but if you give it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.740" end="00:19:50.180" style="s2">antidepressants in the aftermath of its</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.910" end="00:19:52.520" style="s2">defeat it doesn&#39;t contract plus it will</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.180" end="00:19:56.540" style="s2">fight right away it just well it just</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.520" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">shows you the idea of evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.540" end="00:20:01.220" style="s2">determined instincts in my opinion is</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:04.790" style="s2">not a theory at all it&#39;s an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.220" end="00:20:07.160" style="s2">self-evident fact and it manifests</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.790" end="00:20:10.870" style="s2">itself in all sorts of strange ways so</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.160" end="00:20:14.990" style="s2">for example we know with chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.870" end="00:20:20.740" style="s2">chimpanzees basically go to war there</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.990" end="00:20:23.060" style="s2">they&#39;re wired up to regard chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.740" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">conspecifics who aren&#39;t in their tribe</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.060" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">as something to react against with fear</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:36.470" style="s2">and hostility and if a wandering group</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:38.690" style="s2">of chimpanzees say numbering 3 or 4 at</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.470" end="00:20:41.330" style="s2">the periphery of their territory comes</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.690" end="00:20:43.790" style="s2">across an isolated individual or two</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.330" end="00:20:49.310" style="s2">from another group they&#39;ll tear them</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.790" end="00:20:52.100" style="s2">into shreds and that that primordial</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.310" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">response to the stranger sheds</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.100" end="00:20:58.580" style="s2">substantial light on how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.070" end="00:21:02.090" style="s2">human beings demonize and then persecute</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.580" end="00:21:04.550" style="s2">their so-called enemies so we still</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.090" end="00:21:05.180" style="s2">we&#39;ve still retained this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.550" end="00:21:08.060" style="s2">obtain</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.180" end="00:21:11.780" style="s2">to fire a target for our resentment our</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.060" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">our hatred and our fear as well and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.780" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">can be demonization as you say is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:20.150" style="s2">correct well part of it we could immune</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">can break it up into two two aspects I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.150" end="00:21:25.310" style="s2">think and this is something I go into</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:26.810" style="s2">great detail about in maps of meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.310" end="00:21:28.870" style="s2">some sense this is what the book is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.810" end="00:21:33.550" style="s2">about because I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.870" end="00:21:37.100" style="s2">territoriality and cruelty and now</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.550" end="00:21:40.790" style="s2">animals are territorial and if another</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.100" end="00:21:42.740" style="s2">animal of the same species trespasses on</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.790" end="00:21:44.660" style="s2">to a complex animals territory there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.740" end="00:21:47.090" style="s2">be a fight and I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.660" end="00:21:49.700" style="s2">understandable because animals need</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.090" end="00:21:52.340" style="s2">territory and human beings are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.700" end="00:21:54.710" style="s2">territorial we&#39;re territorial about our</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.340" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">actual physical space and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.710" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">territorial about our ideological or</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:02.150" style="s2">cultural space and it&#39;s because we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:04.370" style="s2">to inhabit a physical territory and we</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.320" end="00:22:22.420" style="s2">appropriately using analogs from animal</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.540" end="00:22:33.490" style="s2">well those emotions I think are much</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.870" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">more specifically human there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.490" end="00:22:40.430" style="s2">examples from 20th century history of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:43.130" style="s2">the persecution of enemies going far</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.330" end="00:22:53.180" style="s2">of that sort of behavior abound in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:57.460" style="s2">Holocaust literature where the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.180" end="00:23:00.680" style="s2">went out of their way not only to</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.680" end="00:23:06.050" style="s2">so forth but to torment them and torture</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.590" end="00:23:24.860" style="s2">dehumanized them to treat them as no</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:30.679" style="s2">they called them but not forgetting that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.860" end="00:23:33.080" style="s2">there were earlier examples before in</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.080" end="00:23:39.400" style="s2">sure and its scale and its</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.779" end="00:23:43.960" style="s2">cold-bloodedness but if we go back to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.400" end="00:23:46.700" style="s2">times of say one of the earlier ones</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.960" end="00:23:49.580" style="s2">tyrants that I thought were horrific was</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.830" end="00:24:02.779" style="s2">difference between that and say the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:04.520" style="s2">crimes of the narcy&#39;s well I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.779" end="00:24:06.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a particular difference between</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.520" end="00:24:08.659" style="s2">that and the crimes of the Nazis and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.590" end="00:24:10.730" style="s2">also think that kind of behavior is far</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.659" end="00:24:14.630" style="s2">more normative than anybody ever likes</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.730" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">to think I mean our in in in modern</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.630" end="00:24:20.600" style="s2">times the Holocaust is sort of become</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:24.230" style="s2">archetypal of totalitarian evil more</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.600" end="00:24:27.320" style="s2">than just brutality but my sense after</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.230" end="00:24:29.720" style="s2">having researched this for for a lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.320" end="00:24:31.789" style="s2">period of time is that the hope the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.720" end="00:24:34.990" style="s2">behavior that characterized people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.789" end="00:24:39.950" style="s2">were involved in the Holocaust was uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.990" end="00:24:44.630" style="s2">essentially normative and even in 20th</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.950" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">century history the numbers that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.630" end="00:24:53.270" style="s2">numbers involved in the Holocaust per se</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:55.580" style="s2">aren&#39;t of any order of magnitude they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.270" end="00:24:57.500" style="s2">they&#39;re not special they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.580" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">not immense by any stretch of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.500" end="00:25:01.789" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:03.350" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn estimated that Stalin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.789" end="00:25:05.419" style="s2">brutality killed something in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.350" end="00:25:08.570" style="s2">neighborhood of 60 million people shul</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.419" end="00:25:10.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s estimates from Mao that he</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.570" end="00:25:13.880" style="s2">killed a hundred million people hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.760" end="00:25:16.279" style="s2">in Cambodia we know that at least four</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.880" end="00:25:20.500" style="s2">million people died with the Khmer Rouge</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.279" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">yes so I mean like the Holocaust is is</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.500" end="00:25:27.590" style="s2">the the prime exemplar of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">behavior but it typifies the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.590" end="00:25:31.380" style="s2">century and as you already pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:33.630" style="s2">it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.380" end="00:25:36.450" style="s2">rose in the twentieth century it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.630" end="00:25:37.920" style="s2">of our it&#39;s part of our nature but what</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.450" end="00:25:41.790" style="s2">about the different what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.920" end="00:25:45.480" style="s2">difference between someone who would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.790" end="00:25:48.570" style="s2">a concentration guard concentration camp</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.480" end="00:25:52.500" style="s2">card who who would put these appalled</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.570" end="00:25:54.510" style="s2">victims into the gas chamber or the guy</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.500" end="00:25:56.520" style="s2">who pressed the release button on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.510" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">first atomic bomb from that aircraft</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.520" end="00:26:01.640" style="s2">that he knew would slaughter thousands</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:04.260" style="s2">or hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.640" end="00:26:06.930" style="s2">because both those two people believed</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.260" end="00:26:09.810" style="s2">in something is this where it really</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.930" end="00:26:14.130" style="s2">boils down to the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.810" end="00:26:16.650" style="s2">good and evil I think people use their</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.130" end="00:26:20.460" style="s2">their claim that they believe in</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.650" end="00:26:23.850" style="s2">something - look people will protect</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.460" end="00:26:25.860" style="s2">what they believe in using the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.850" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">mechanisms that they&#39;ll protect</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.860" end="00:26:32.070" style="s2">territory so for example if you own your</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:34.560" style="s2">house and someone walks into it at night</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.070" end="00:26:37.530" style="s2">under English common law you have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.560" end="00:26:40.380" style="s2">right to say leave and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.530" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">right to say leave I have a gun and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.380" end="00:26:45.390" style="s2">you have the right to say leave I have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:46.710" style="s2">gun and fire a warning shot and then if</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.390" end="00:26:48.870" style="s2">they don&#39;t leave you have the right to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.710" end="00:26:51.660" style="s2">shoot them and you can&#39;t be prosecuted</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.870" end="00:26:53.730" style="s2">for that okay and everyone would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.660" end="00:26:56.820" style="s2">well you are within your rights because</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.730" end="00:26:59.130" style="s2">you were protecting your territory okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.820" end="00:27:00.900" style="s2">so I think people have a right to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.130" end="00:27:02.300" style="s2">protect their territory and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.900" end="00:27:04.590" style="s2">right to protect their ideological</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.300" end="00:27:09.150" style="s2">territory and there is rules of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.590" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">engagement that could govern disputes of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.150" end="00:27:14.130" style="s2">that nature but when you&#39;re there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:16.200" style="s2">there&#39;s other sorts of acts and many of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.130" end="00:27:19.110" style="s2">those characterized behavior in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.200" end="00:27:20.760" style="s2">concentration camps in the Nazi era that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.110" end="00:27:23.070" style="s2">can&#39;t be explained by mere</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.760" end="00:27:25.560" style="s2">territoriality and that&#39;s when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.070" end="00:27:27.420" style="s2">necessary as far as I&#39;m concerned to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.560" end="00:27:29.550" style="s2">bring in conceptions derive from</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.420" end="00:27:34.110" style="s2">mythology like the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.550" end="00:27:37.530" style="s2">good and evil and I think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.110" end="00:27:40.740" style="s2">define evil and evil is an act that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.530" end="00:27:43.950" style="s2">designed to produce a negative outcome</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.740" end="00:27:45.780" style="s2">for everyone who&#39;s involved</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.950" end="00:27:47.490" style="s2">at that includes the victim and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.780" end="00:27:50.430" style="s2">perpetrator sure but where does evil</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.490" end="00:27:52.710" style="s2">come from in your concept of this well</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.430" end="00:27:55.230" style="s2">dissipation is external reason why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.710" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">very useful to look at mythology because</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.230" end="00:27:59.850" style="s2">if you look at the first few chapters in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.070" style="s2">Genesis is a very clear story so let me</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.850" end="00:28:04.830" style="s2">tell you one of the stories it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.070" end="00:28:08.250" style="s2">worth knowing okay so as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.830" end="00:28:11.970" style="s2">concerned when Adam and Eve eat the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.250" end="00:28:15.870" style="s2">fruit of the tree of the the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.970" end="00:28:17.430" style="s2">of good and evil their eyes open and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.870" end="00:28:19.920" style="s2">first thing that happens is that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.430" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">notice that they&#39;re naked okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.920" end="00:28:24.120" style="s2">does that mean it means they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.490" style="s2">illuminated with regards to their own</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.120" end="00:28:28.110" style="s2">vulnerable nature because to be naked</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.490" end="00:28:30.330" style="s2">and to know you&#39;re naked is to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.110" end="00:28:33.210" style="s2">exposed and vulnerable and to know it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.330" end="00:28:34.830" style="s2">and often people for example will dream</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.210" end="00:28:38.780" style="s2">that they have been stripped naked in</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.830" end="00:28:42.030" style="s2">front of a crowd it means their material</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.780" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">vulnerability is exposed for everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.030" end="00:28:48.210" style="s2">see okay the first thing Adam and Eve do</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.650" style="s2">once they discover that they&#39;re naked is</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.210" end="00:28:52.470" style="s2">to clothe themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.650" end="00:28:54.740" style="s2">cover themselves up and human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.470" end="00:28:57.720" style="s2">the only creatures that wear clothes and</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.740" end="00:29:01.170" style="s2">clothes separate our vulnerability from</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.720" end="00:29:03.180" style="s2">the natural and social worlds they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.170" end="00:29:06.150" style="s2">protective in reality and their</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.180" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2">protective symbolically all right the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.150" end="00:29:11.580" style="s2">next thing that happens is that God</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:14.520" style="s2">comes walking through the garden in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.580" end="00:29:18.260" style="s2">morning and he looks for Adam and Adam</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.520" end="00:29:21.270" style="s2">is hiding behind a bush and God says</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.260" end="00:29:25.110" style="s2">Adam where are you I&#39;m used to walking</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.270" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">with you and Adam says I&#39;m too afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.110" end="00:29:31.530" style="s2">come out because I found out that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:34.010" style="s2">naked and God says who told you that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.530" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">were naked and Adam blames the woman</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.010" end="00:29:38.510" style="s2">okay so then you think well why would</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">Adam hide from God</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.510" end="00:29:50.040" style="s2">all right so imagine God God symbolizes</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:52.200" style="s2">a transcendent totality and this story</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.040" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">indicates that at some point in human</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.200" end="00:29:57.299" style="s2">history there was an unbroken</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:59.820" style="s2">relationship between the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.299" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">tality and the individual but when the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.820" end="00:30:05.999" style="s2">individual became self-conscious that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:08.610" style="s2">totality was threatened so why does adam</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.999" end="00:30:13.350" style="s2">hide well he knows he&#39;s naked and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.610" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">vulnerable so he hides from he hides</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.350" end="00:30:19.110" style="s2">from the demands of of destiny he hides</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:22.110" style="s2">from what&#39;s best in himself because he</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.110" end="00:30:26.070" style="s2">looks at himself and thinks I&#39;m nothing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.110" end="00:30:30.830" style="s2">I&#39;m weak I&#39;m I can be easily hurt and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.070" end="00:30:33.090" style="s2">therefore when God calls I have to hide</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.830" end="00:30:34.440" style="s2">well the next thing that happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.090" end="00:30:38.789" style="s2">Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.440" end="00:30:42.989" style="s2">and God says well life is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.789" end="00:30:45.899" style="s2">difficult now okay that sets the issue</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.989" end="00:30:48.509" style="s2">up the next chapter starts with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.899" end="00:30:52.109" style="s2">birth of Cain and Abel now Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.509" end="00:30:55.289" style="s2">are the first two humans born in history</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.109" end="00:30:57.960" style="s2">right because everything that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.289" end="00:31:00.600" style="s2">the Garden of Eden is pre historical</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.960" end="00:31:02.929" style="s2">human history starts with the fall of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.600" end="00:31:06.690" style="s2">man the rise of self-consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.929" end="00:31:09.149" style="s2">Cain and Abel are the first two humans</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.690" end="00:31:11.929" style="s2">and they&#39;re symbolic of two attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.149" end="00:31:19.859" style="s2">towards the revelation of vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.929" end="00:31:22.259" style="s2">now Abel is a shepherd and Cain raises</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.859" end="00:31:26.340" style="s2">vegetables and they&#39;re both required to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.259" end="00:31:27.960" style="s2">make sacrifices to God okay now why</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.340" end="00:31:31.109" style="s2">would you make a sacrifice well it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.960" end="00:31:34.769" style="s2">archaic idea you burn something smoke</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.109" end="00:31:36.869" style="s2">rises up to heaven gods in heaven and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.769" end="00:31:40.590" style="s2">can judge the quality of your sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.869" end="00:31:42.450" style="s2">by evaluating the smoke we think well</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.590" end="00:31:44.909" style="s2">that&#39;s a very archaic idea and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.450" end="00:31:47.789" style="s2">could a modern person do with that well</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.909" end="00:31:50.489" style="s2">a modern person could give these archaic</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.789" end="00:31:54.210" style="s2">people some credit first so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.489" end="00:31:55.859" style="s2">why is God in heaven well it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.210" end="00:31:58.889" style="s2">when you look at the sky at night it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.859" end="00:32:03.269" style="s2">fills you with awe you see an unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.889" end="00:32:06.899" style="s2">expanse of being and that&#39;s the closest</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.269" end="00:32:09.820" style="s2">you get to directly experiencing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.899" end="00:32:12.250" style="s2">unnameable totality</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.820" end="00:32:14.380" style="s2">okay why should you make sacrifices to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.250" end="00:32:18.010" style="s2">God why would he be pleased with</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.380" end="00:32:20.110" style="s2">sacrifices well I would say you already</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.010" end="00:32:22.870" style="s2">know that because if I asked you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.110" end="00:32:25.810" style="s2">well what sacrifices have you made to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.870" end="00:32:28.690" style="s2">make things better in your life no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.810" end="00:32:30.520" style="s2">you could immediately tell me now our</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.690" end="00:32:31.750" style="s2">cake people had to act that out because</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.520" end="00:32:34.630" style="s2">they didn&#39;t really have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.750" end="00:32:36.700" style="s2">philosophical conceptions in verbalize</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.630" end="00:32:38.830" style="s2">herbal form but they still had an</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.700" end="00:32:41.530" style="s2">intuition that it was necessary to make</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.830" end="00:32:43.630" style="s2">the right sacrifice in order to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.530" end="00:32:47.770" style="s2">an appropriate relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.630" end="00:32:50.350" style="s2">totality of being okay so able make some</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.770" end="00:32:53.530" style="s2">sacrifices and can make some sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.350" end="00:32:56.110" style="s2">now Abel takes the best things he has</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.530" end="00:32:58.090" style="s2">and offers them to God so they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.110" end="00:33:00.430" style="s2">firstborn of his flock and the choicest</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.090" end="00:33:02.410" style="s2">cuts of meat when Abel&#39;s called on to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.430" end="00:33:05.470" style="s2">make a sacrifice he doesn&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.410" end="00:33:09.390" style="s2">anything back he puts himself on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.470" end="00:33:13.240" style="s2">line and he sacrifices courageously and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.390" end="00:33:16.690" style="s2">clearly and Cain by contrast he brings</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.240" end="00:33:20.790" style="s2">in some ratty little you know wrinkly</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:24.160" style="s2">old vegetables and sacrifices those so</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.790" end="00:33:26.620" style="s2">God smiles on Abel sacrifices and frowns</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.160" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">on Cain so what does that mean well</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.620" end="00:33:31.540" style="s2">Abel&#39;s making the right sacrifices so</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:34.300" style="s2">everyone likes him is this his</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.540" end="00:33:38.020" style="s2">Enterprises flourish he has good the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.300" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">intimate relationships he he produces a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.020" end="00:33:42.310" style="s2">thriving family because he makes the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:44.740" style="s2">right decisions and Cain on the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.310" end="00:33:46.780" style="s2">hand everything goes wrong for him so</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.740" end="00:33:49.030" style="s2">this makes a mat it says in the Old</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.780" end="00:33:49.780" style="s2">Testament his countenance falls what</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.030" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.780" end="00:33:56.020" style="s2">he gets bitter and resentful and angry</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:59.050" style="s2">and depressed he&#39;s mad about how things</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.020" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">are turning out so he goes and he has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.050" end="00:34:02.290" style="s2">little shot with God and he says look</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:04.780" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.290" end="00:34:06.910" style="s2">here I&#39;m working myself to the bone I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.780" end="00:34:09.940" style="s2">making sacrifices left right and center</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.910" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">and everything is not turning out for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.940" end="00:34:18.430" style="s2">like what gives and God says pay</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:20.590" style="s2">attention here it&#39;s your problem that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.430" end="00:34:23.710" style="s2">things aren&#39;t going well</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.590" end="00:34:26.410" style="s2">the the monster of sin crouches at your</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.710" end="00:34:28.840" style="s2">door and you welcome it in you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.410" end="00:34:30.760" style="s2">reject it you could do things right you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.840" end="00:34:34.690" style="s2">know exactly what the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.760" end="00:34:36.130" style="s2">is yet you refuse to do it so all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.690" end="00:34:38.410" style="s2">trouble you&#39;re having is your fault</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.130" end="00:34:40.330" style="s2">don&#39;t come along and blame me just get</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.410" end="00:34:43.210" style="s2">yourself put together properly and do</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.330" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">things right and so that&#39;s the end of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.210" end="00:34:47.290" style="s2">the conversation well that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:48.940" style="s2">Cain wants to hear he wants to hear that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.290" end="00:34:50.440" style="s2">the world&#39;s a miserable place and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.940" end="00:34:52.840" style="s2">the reason that he&#39;s failing is is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.440" end="00:34:54.010" style="s2">because of the structure of reality he</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.840" end="00:34:56.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to hear that it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.010" end="00:34:58.780" style="s2">problem so this just makes them</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.140" end="00:35:01.950" style="s2">absolutely boiling mat and the first</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.780" end="00:35:03.610" style="s2">thing he does is go and kill Abel well</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.950" end="00:35:07.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.610" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">territoriality and evil and he wants</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.090" end="00:35:12.520" style="s2">what Abel has he wants to be able but</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:14.770" style="s2">instead he destroys him out of spite and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.520" end="00:35:18.970" style="s2">resentment and revenge against the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.770" end="00:35:22.150" style="s2">nature of reality well then God gets</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.970" end="00:35:24.190" style="s2">wind of it marks Cain he says no one</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.150" end="00:35:26.230" style="s2">killed him and you might think well why</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.190" end="00:35:30.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s God who says an eye for an</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.230" end="00:35:32.410" style="s2">eye well the next little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.100" end="00:35:35.580" style="s2">story which is barely there anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.410" end="00:35:38.590" style="s2">it&#39;s so edited out explains exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.580" end="00:35:43.510" style="s2">Cain wanders away and he gets married</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.590" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">and he has a family but if you mess</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.510" end="00:35:48.070" style="s2">around with any of Cain&#39;s family if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:49.900" style="s2">annoy them or bother them or make them</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.070" end="00:35:52.870" style="s2">resentful or angry they don&#39;t just kill</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.900" end="00:35:55.240" style="s2">one person they kill seven and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.870" end="00:36:00.220" style="s2">those children have children and if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.240" end="00:36:04.600" style="s2">annoy them they kill 70 and at the end</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.220" end="00:36:07.330" style="s2">of that acceleration of revenge oriented</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.600" end="00:36:09.100" style="s2">killing God comes along and floods</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.330" end="00:36:12.250" style="s2">everything that&#39;s when this story of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.100" end="00:36:16.390" style="s2">Noah and the Ark kicks in and the story</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.250" end="00:36:18.910" style="s2">is very clear it says this if you act</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.390" end="00:36:20.860" style="s2">improperly and if you do the things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.910" end="00:36:23.230" style="s2">you know to be wrong if you don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.860" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">the right sacrifices your life will not</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.230" end="00:36:27.520" style="s2">turn out well you&#39;ll be punished all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:29.170" style="s2">time for your foolishness and your</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:33.110" style="s2">weakness and that will make you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.170" end="00:36:36.290" style="s2">resentful twisted bitter and murderous</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.110" end="00:36:39.620" style="s2">when you act on those motivations</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.290" end="00:36:43.820" style="s2">because of spite and resentment you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.620" end="00:36:48.380" style="s2">you&#39;ll initiate a cataclysm of revenge</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.820" end="00:36:49.790" style="s2">oriented killings and if no stop is put</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.380" end="00:36:53.500" style="s2">to them that will spread through the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.790" end="00:36:58.850" style="s2">entire society and invite the apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.500" end="00:37:03.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s the second third major story</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.850" end="00:37:06.080" style="s2">in Genesis do this actly right mmm</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.050" end="00:37:09.590" style="s2">listen some very very strong would you</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.330" end="00:37:43.700" style="s2">several thousand years it&#39;s undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:47.300" style="s2">part of a larger oral tradition it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.700" end="00:37:51.230" style="s2">edited by many many people and told and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.300" end="00:37:53.300" style="s2">retold and all that&#39;s left of that story</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.230" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">is what&#39;s intensely memorable because</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.300" end="00:37:57.700" style="s2">otherwise it wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:38:03.260" style="s2">forgotten and it just says something</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.700" end="00:38:07.340" style="s2">blatantly it says that you can accept</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.260" end="00:38:10.520" style="s2">your you can accept the need to make</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.420" end="00:38:19.400" style="s2">that and act improperly if you fight</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.750" end="00:38:20.990" style="s2">against that and act improperly then</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.400" end="00:38:23.210" style="s2">you&#39;re going to compromise your</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.990" end="00:38:26.900" style="s2">relationship with the totality of being</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.210" end="00:38:29.030" style="s2">and as soon as you do that you might as</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.190" end="00:40:53.359" style="s2">and another one that comes to mind is he</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.940" end="00:40:57.450" style="s2">who lives by the sword dies by the sword</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:41:00.450" style="s2">in the east they have their concept of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.450" end="00:41:02.339" style="s2">and tradition of karma yeah well karma</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.450" end="00:41:04.650" style="s2">karma is a karma is a really good</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.339" end="00:41:07.500" style="s2">example because the idea behind karma</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.650" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting I think from a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.500" end="00:41:13.559" style="s2">neuropsychological perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:15.780" style="s2">karma is predicated on the idea that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.559" end="00:41:18.660" style="s2">is fundamentally impossible for you to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.780" end="00:41:20.520" style="s2">get away with anything but and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.660" end="00:41:22.890" style="s2">an idea in Christianity that&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.520" end="00:41:25.170" style="s2">too it&#39;s a little more archaic and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.890" end="00:41:27.630" style="s2">dramatic than the idea of karma the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.170" end="00:41:29.640" style="s2">in Christianity is that all of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.630" end="00:41:32.250" style="s2">actions and motivations are in some</p>

<p begin="00:41:32.250" end="00:41:41.390" style="s2">brought to task for them but and modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.930" end="00:41:44.190" style="s2">people look at that especially when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.390" end="00:41:46.549" style="s2">represented metaphorically as say a wise</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.650" end="00:42:08.069" style="s2">you will eventually pay for it you might</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.069" end="00:42:14.309" style="s2">paying for because often the punishment</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.160" end="00:42:16.559" style="s2">and the crime are so distant in time</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.309" end="00:42:18.420" style="s2">from one another that the causal</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.559" end="00:42:20.790" style="s2">connection is virtually impossible to</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.790" end="00:42:26.760" style="s2">there now one of the things I attempted</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.599" end="00:42:29.099" style="s2">to lay out in maps of meaning in some</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.250" end="00:46:38.010" style="s2">you can also derive strength from that</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.719" end="00:47:03.829" style="s2">always in fact so fascinating the fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.699" end="00:47:05.659" style="s2">that something isn&#39;t known here means</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.829" end="00:47:08.359" style="s2">that I could go and discover that I</p>

<p begin="00:47:14.389" end="00:47:20.499" style="s2">mythology is the person who voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.669" end="00:47:23.179" style="s2">encounters the unknown and and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.499" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">unbelievably old concept it&#39;s the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.179" end="00:47:28.639" style="s2">concept we know that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:31.069" style="s2">created it stems all the way back to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.639" end="00:47:32.749" style="s2">ANU MELAS the Mesopotamian creation myth</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.069" end="00:47:36.259" style="s2">which is the oldest written document we</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.749" end="00:47:38.479" style="s2">have and it&#39;s the enumeration is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.259" end="00:47:42.079" style="s2">story on which the first story in</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.479" end="00:47:44.119" style="s2">Genesis is based now here here&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.079" end="00:47:46.429" style="s2">of thinking about things and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.119" end="00:47:49.880" style="s2">mythological way and it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.429" end="00:47:52.249" style="s2">useful so forget for a minute the idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.880" end="00:47:54.469" style="s2">that the world is made out of matter and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.249" end="00:47:56.299" style="s2">forget that it&#39;s made out of objects</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.469" end="00:48:00.559" style="s2">look at it from a different perspective</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.299" end="00:48:03.079" style="s2">we&#39;ll say the world of experience which</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.559" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">is the world you inhabit is made out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.079" end="00:48:09.259" style="s2">three things it&#39;s made out of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:10.579" style="s2">that no matter how much you know there</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.259" end="00:48:13.939" style="s2">are going to be phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.579" end="00:48:16.489" style="s2">occurrences that exceed your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.939" end="00:48:19.459" style="s2">for comprehension and that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.489" end="00:48:22.130" style="s2">going to be the case and so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.459" end="00:48:26.239" style="s2">to call that a category that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.130" end="00:48:27.529" style="s2">category of the unknown and then there</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.239" end="00:48:29.149" style="s2">are always going to be things that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.529" end="00:48:30.229" style="s2">know and understand and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.149" end="00:48:32.869" style="s2">your tradition we&#39;re going to call that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.229" end="00:48:35.539" style="s2">the known so wherever you go wherever</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.869" end="00:48:38.959" style="s2">you are there&#39;s a balance between the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.539" end="00:48:40.579" style="s2">known and the unknown and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.959" end="00:48:42.349" style="s2">thing is the fact of you there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.579" end="00:48:45.499" style="s2">conscious observer there and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.349" end="00:48:47.209" style="s2">conscious observer is the place where</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.499" end="00:48:50.749" style="s2">the known and the unknown interact</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.209" end="00:48:53.239" style="s2">that&#39;s the mythological actors the known</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.749" end="00:48:55.219" style="s2">that&#39;s the Great Father the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.239" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the great mother and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.219" end="00:49:02.689" style="s2">individual and the Daoists represent</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:05.029" style="s2">that as yin and yang or chaos versus</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.689" end="00:49:07.219" style="s2">order people think about that as</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.029" end="00:49:09.190" style="s2">masculine versus feminine that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.219" end="00:49:11.319" style="s2">a bad interpretation or</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.190" end="00:49:15.160" style="s2">insufficient interpretation of taoist</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.319" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">thought the taoist say experience is</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.160" end="00:49:21.730" style="s2">made of chaos and order and the proper</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:23.859" style="s2">place to stand is right between them and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.730" end="00:49:26.589" style="s2">you can tell when you&#39;re standing right</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.859" end="00:49:28.509" style="s2">between chaos and order because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.589" end="00:49:31.150" style="s2">when you feel that things are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.509" end="00:49:32.740" style="s2">and that means that meaning is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.150" end="00:49:36.490" style="s2">instinct that tells you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.740" end="00:49:37.900" style="s2">standing in the right place now people</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.490" end="00:49:39.130" style="s2">are vulnerable and they&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.900" end="00:49:41.710" style="s2">because of that and they can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.130" end="00:49:45.099" style="s2">challenged and hurt and they can be made</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.710" end="00:49:47.319" style="s2">angry and murderous but I would say well</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.099" end="00:49:50.619" style="s2">if you stand between chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.319" end="00:49:52.839" style="s2">properly your life can become so</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.619" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">meaningful that the meaning gives you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.839" end="00:49:58.089" style="s2">confidence and power and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:50:00.609" style="s2">overcome your sense of shameful</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.089" end="00:50:02.769" style="s2">vulnerability and I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.609" end="00:50:05.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what religious stories are</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.769" end="00:50:09.519" style="s2">telling you to do now we go back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.799" end="00:50:13.539" style="s2">Genesis in the beginning God makes order</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.519" end="00:50:15.339" style="s2">out of chaos and that story is based on</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.539" end="00:50:18.220" style="s2">an order architecture derived from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.339" end="00:50:21.519" style="s2">ANU male ish in the anu male ish a god</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.220" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">named Marduk cuts up the dragon of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.519" end="00:50:28.049" style="s2">and makes the world out of her pieces</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:33.400" style="s2">well the dragon of chaos recurs as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.049" end="00:50:38.859" style="s2">mythological motif frequently generally</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.400" end="00:50:44.410" style="s2">in the guise of Leviathan say and yahwah</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.859" end="00:50:47.430" style="s2">is envisioned as the deity that derives</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.410" end="00:50:49.690" style="s2">order habitable order from chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.430" end="00:50:52.269" style="s2">immediately after yahwah derives</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.690" end="00:50:54.460" style="s2">habitable order from chaos he announces</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.269" end="00:50:56.259" style="s2">he makes human beings and then he</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.460" end="00:50:59.670" style="s2">announces that they are made in his</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.259" end="00:51:02.589" style="s2">image male and female made in his image</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.670" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">what we think that means that God is</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.589" end="00:51:07.930" style="s2">like a human being but what it really</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:10.059" style="s2">means is that the human being is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.930" end="00:51:13.240" style="s2">God in that the human being has the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.059" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">capacity to make order out of chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.240" end="00:51:16.750" style="s2">when we say that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:20.200" style="s2">divine about a person that gives them</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.750" end="00:51:22.820" style="s2">intrinsic rights what we mean is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.200" end="00:51:26.550" style="s2">fact that each human being can make</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.820" end="00:51:28.890" style="s2">order out of chaos means that every</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.550" end="00:51:31.530" style="s2">single person is deserving of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.890" end="00:51:33.990" style="s2">kind of respect even if their murderous</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.810" end="00:51:42.540" style="s2">still they&#39;re still embodied with it the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.110" end="00:51:45.000" style="s2">kind of dignity that only identity with</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.540" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">God can provide and that identity is the</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:55.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just a metaphor mm-hmm what</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.250" end="00:51:57.300" style="s2">about the people who of the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.050" end="00:52:00.120" style="s2">criminals of whom which said they had no</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.300" end="00:52:01.860" style="s2">conscience or their conscience is dead</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.120" end="00:52:04.320" style="s2">what&#39;s happened with those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.860" end="00:52:06.840" style="s2">individuals is it so just very</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.320" end="00:52:09.480" style="s2">suppressed or has it really died</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.840" end="00:52:11.820" style="s2">something in them died a spark gone ELPS</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.480" end="00:52:13.410" style="s2">well you know that that&#39;s such that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.820" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">such a difficult question you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.410" end="00:52:19.380" style="s2">because we know for example that certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:22.650" style="s2">kinds of extreme brain damage can cause</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.380" end="00:52:26.700" style="s2">a kind of criminal behavior so for</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.650" end="00:52:30.180" style="s2">example if your prefrontal cortex is</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.870" end="00:52:55.710" style="s2">it&#39;s very it&#39;s a it&#39;s a situation that</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:03.900" style="s2">I would say what Solzhenitsyn said and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.290" end="00:53:06.780" style="s2">what he said was that in every person no</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.900" end="00:53:09.240" style="s2">matter how good there is a little corner</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.780" end="00:53:12.300" style="s2">of corruption and evil that still hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.240" end="00:53:13.890" style="s2">been overcome and then in every one no</p>

<p begin="00:53:13.890" end="00:53:18.390" style="s2">little bit of a little corner of good</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:21.180" style="s2">that&#39;s still a possibility that might be</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.390" end="00:53:24.630" style="s2">made to manifest itself and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.180" end="00:53:28.380" style="s2">exactly know how to reconcile those two</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.630" end="00:53:30.570" style="s2">different viewpoints you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.380" end="00:53:33.960" style="s2">think I think each of them are right</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.570" end="00:53:36.180" style="s2">even though their juxtaposition makes</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.960" end="00:53:39.720" style="s2">them makes a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.180" end="00:53:42.599" style="s2">now so looking at peridot it was like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.720" end="00:53:44.970" style="s2">read about Ted Bundy mmm you know about</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.599" end="00:53:48.690" style="s2">Ted Bundy goons and it was a law student</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.970" end="00:53:52.740" style="s2">in um in the u.s. very good-looking</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.690" end="00:53:54.900" style="s2">young man and he raped and murdered a a</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.740" end="00:53:59.190" style="s2">number of young women and one of his</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.900" end="00:54:02.660" style="s2">tricks was to put on a fake cast and to</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.660" end="00:54:08.339" style="s2">someone young and beautiful who is</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.099" end="00:54:11.869" style="s2">driving a vehicle to use their sympathy</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.339" end="00:54:16.200" style="s2">as a means of getting them compromised</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.869" end="00:54:19.619" style="s2">he was a terrible person but I read</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.200" end="00:54:22.170" style="s2">about his journey downhill you know and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.619" end="00:54:25.529" style="s2">he said he first started to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.170" end="00:54:27.329" style="s2">in violent pornography and that as far</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.529" end="00:54:29.789" style="s2">as he was concerned that was what opened</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.329" end="00:54:31.770" style="s2">the door and I think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.789" end="00:54:34.529" style="s2">metaphor I mean one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.770" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">talked about continually when he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.529" end="00:54:39.140" style="s2">attempting to explain what had happened</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:43.650" style="s2">in Nazi Germany was the fact that a</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.140" end="00:54:47.130" style="s2">person moving moving downhill to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.650" end="00:54:49.770" style="s2">horrific end point like a concentration</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.130" end="00:54:51.779" style="s2">camp guards say makes a little mistake</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.770" end="00:54:54.510" style="s2">knows it&#39;s a mistake makes a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.779" end="00:54:56.279" style="s2">mistake little compromise and that puts</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.510" end="00:54:59.039" style="s2">them in a position where another</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.279" end="00:55:00.270" style="s2">compromise is more likely and then that</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.039" end="00:55:04.380" style="s2">puts them in a position where another</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.270" end="00:55:08.309" style="s2">compromise is more likely and 300</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.380" end="00:55:11.789" style="s2">compromises later is there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.309" end="00:55:14.369" style="s2">book called ordinary man it&#39;s a study of</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.789" end="00:55:16.520" style="s2">a Police Battalion in Poland and these</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.369" end="00:55:20.910" style="s2">men started out as normal middle-aged</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.520" end="00:55:23.819" style="s2">policemen most of them adults before</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.910" end="00:55:26.339" style="s2">Hitler even came to power so not victims</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.819" end="00:55:29.099" style="s2">of Hitlerian propaganda in their</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.339" end="00:55:31.109" style="s2">maturing phase they went from perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.099" end="00:55:32.970" style="s2">ordinary policemen two men who were</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.109" end="00:55:34.619" style="s2">taking naked pregnant women out into</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.970" end="00:55:40.890" style="s2">fields and shooting them behind the head</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.619" end="00:55:44.820" style="s2">and the book details their descent into</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.890" end="00:55:47.550" style="s2">this hellish place step by step</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.820" end="00:55:49.950" style="s2">well I think that&#39;s how people descent</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.550" end="00:55:53.100" style="s2">you know it&#39;s step by step and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.950" end="00:55:57.510" style="s2">under most circumstances that every step</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.100" end="00:55:59.130" style="s2">is conscious even though the memory of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.510" end="00:56:02.700" style="s2">making this step might fade into</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.130" end="00:56:05.880" style="s2">unconsciousness and the full cataclysmic</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.700" end="00:56:09.140" style="s2">consequences of each moral error aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.880" end="00:56:12.060" style="s2">necessarily evident so what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.140" end="00:56:14.520" style="s2">the case of looking at the individual as</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.060" end="00:56:17.940" style="s2">opposed to the group consciousness very</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.520" end="00:56:20.340" style="s2">quickly when someone has what&#39;s known as</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.940" end="00:56:22.650" style="s2">a nervous breakdown is that when they</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.340" end="00:56:24.630" style="s2">just can&#39;t make order out of anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.650" end="00:56:28.680" style="s2">they just can&#39;t cope</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.630" end="00:56:30.180" style="s2">they just withdrawal sure that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.680" end="00:56:32.840" style="s2">what we could look at that neural</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.180" end="00:56:36.450" style="s2">psychologically or we could look at it</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.840" end="00:56:39.420" style="s2">descriptively so here&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.450" end="00:56:42.150" style="s2">neural psychologically there is a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.420" end="00:56:44.700" style="s2">brain organ called the hippocampus and</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.150" end="00:56:47.190" style="s2">the hippocampus helps you know where you</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.700" end="00:56:50.970" style="s2">are and what you&#39;re doing and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.190" end="00:56:53.130" style="s2">inhibits a whole array of more</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.970" end="00:56:55.580" style="s2">primordial emotional structures</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.130" end="00:56:58.230" style="s2">particularly the amygdala and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.580" end="00:57:01.260" style="s2">hypothalamus now the amygdala is</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.230" end="00:57:03.150" style="s2">responsible for anxiety and fear and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.260" end="00:57:06.090" style="s2">hypothalamus is responsible for all</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.150" end="00:57:08.310" style="s2">different kinds of motivation now as</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.090" end="00:57:10.320" style="s2">long as you know where you are and what</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.310" end="00:57:13.020" style="s2">you&#39;re doing which means that when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.320" end="00:57:15.000" style="s2">act the outcome you desire occurs</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.020" end="00:57:17.130" style="s2">because that sort of defines knowing</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.000" end="00:57:20.180" style="s2">where you are and what you&#39;re doing then</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.130" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">the amygdala and the hypothalamus remain</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.180" end="00:57:25.910" style="s2">inhibited now as soon as things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:29.130" style="s2">turning out the way you expect them to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.910" end="00:57:31.980" style="s2">then the amygdala is disinhibited and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.130" end="00:57:34.560" style="s2">is the hypothalamus and then the hypo</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.980" end="00:57:36.360" style="s2">then you get afraid and paralyzed and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.560" end="00:57:39.780" style="s2">the hypothalamus starts to produce a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.360" end="00:57:42.450" style="s2">stress hormone called cortisol now</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.780" end="00:57:44.820" style="s2">cortisol is in some ways a stimulant</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.450" end="00:57:47.690" style="s2">it&#39;ll stimulate exploratory behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.820" end="00:57:52.590" style="s2">in small doses it&#39;s pretty good for you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.690" end="00:57:55.050" style="s2">but in large doses it hyper activates</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.590" end="00:57:58.200" style="s2">your physiology shuts off your immune</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.050" end="00:58:01.950" style="s2">system it compromises your long-term car</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.200" end="00:58:05.550" style="s2">the bility and it&#39;s toxic it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.950" end="00:58:07.710" style="s2">destroy the hippocampus and as it</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.550" end="00:58:11.609" style="s2">destroys the hippocampus the ability of</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.710" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">the hippocampus to inhibit your negative</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.609" end="00:58:17.010" style="s2">emotional responses is increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:20.430" style="s2">compromised and that turns into a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.010" end="00:58:23.369" style="s2">and if the cycle gets instantiated with</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.430" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">enough intensity then the entire</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.369" end="00:58:28.470" style="s2">negative emotional system can get dis in</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:31.880" style="s2">evident and the knowledge structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.470" end="00:58:34.200" style="s2">start start to become demolished and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.880" end="00:58:35.690" style="s2">when people talk about a nervous</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.200" end="00:58:38.250" style="s2">breakdown which is usually a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.690" end="00:58:40.800" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder chronic</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.250" end="00:58:43.079" style="s2">repeating depression that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.800" end="00:58:46.500" style="s2">what they&#39;re talking about which is why</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.079" end="00:58:48.750" style="s2">if you have a conversation with someone</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.500" end="00:58:51.210" style="s2">who goes through regular bouts of</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.750" end="00:58:54.599" style="s2">depression their perception of reality</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.210" end="00:58:56.940" style="s2">is distorted they just see everything</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.599" end="00:59:00.089" style="s2">negative about anything you can think</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.940" end="00:59:02.099" style="s2">about yeah well and what happens is you</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.089" end="00:59:04.440" style="s2">may imagine imagine if you&#39;re doing some</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.099" end="00:59:10.710" style="s2">small tasks oh let&#39;s say you&#39;re cutting</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.440" end="00:59:15.810" style="s2">up broccoli for dinner and you you cut</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.710" end="00:59:17.220" style="s2">your finger and I say to you what is</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.810" end="00:59:22.589" style="s2">what is the fact that you cut your</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.220" end="00:59:24.270" style="s2">finger mean here&#39;s some possibilities it</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.589" end="00:59:27.540" style="s2">means you should be more careful when</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.270" end="00:59:31.890" style="s2">you&#39;re cutting broccoli it means that</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.540" end="00:59:33.859" style="s2">you&#39;re actually not very careful the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.890" end="00:59:36.630" style="s2">fact that you&#39;re not very careful about</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.859" end="00:59:38.460" style="s2">cutting broccoli indicates you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.630" end="00:59:41.849" style="s2">probably not as careful as you should be</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.460" end="00:59:43.560" style="s2">about most things you do the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.849" end="00:59:46.530" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is careful about most</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.560" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">things you do as you should be is an</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.530" end="00:59:50.490" style="s2">explanation for why all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:53.849" style="s2">have gone wrong in your life up to this</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.490" end="00:59:57.390" style="s2">point have actually gone wrong people</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.849" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">like you who have had lots of good of</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:06.150" style="s2">sufficiently careful tend to go downhill</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.630" end="01:00:09.240" style="s2">over time plus they&#39;re very not very</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.150" end="01:00:10.700" style="s2">good people maybe they shouldn&#39;t even be</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.240" end="01:00:13.140" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.700" end="01:00:15.930" style="s2">okay that&#39;s how a depressed person</p>

<p begin="01:01:09.630" end="01:01:17.490" style="s2">yes the mythological explanation yes now</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:21.090" style="s2">you were just at a major conference on</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.490" end="01:01:23.490" style="s2">consciousness in Arizona I gather now</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.090" end="01:01:26.070" style="s2">what new ideas did you see presented in</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.490" end="01:01:29.940" style="s2">this field that you found interesting at</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.070" end="01:01:32.340" style="s2">that conference well it&#39;s funny you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.940" end="01:01:34.410" style="s2">this conference I&#39;ve been to that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.340" end="01:01:36.510" style="s2">conference several times and I really</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.410" end="01:01:39.300" style="s2">think the last time I went I had I</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.510" end="01:01:41.670" style="s2">learned things that were more directly</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.300" end="01:01:44.250" style="s2">relevant so let me give you let me give</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.670" end="01:01:47.400" style="s2">an example of that instead it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.250" end="01:01:49.740" style="s2">researcher named Valen wieder who has</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.400" end="01:01:53.090" style="s2">been investigating the mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.740" end="01:01:55.290" style="s2">action of hallucinogenic drugs</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.090" end="01:01:57.420" style="s2">hallucinogenic drugs have been used as</p>

<p begin="01:01:57.420" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">produce mystical experiences of one form</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.270" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">or another and Voland wider actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:08.910" style="s2">provided an explanation of why that</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:14.250" style="s2">might be and that was very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.910" end="01:02:17.340" style="s2">to me so yours when your your senses are</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.250" end="01:02:21.180" style="s2">each somewhat independent systems but</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.340" end="01:02:24.300" style="s2">the the content of your sensory</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.180" end="01:02:28.680" style="s2">experience is unified in a brain area</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.300" end="01:02:30.750" style="s2">called the thalamus now so imagine your</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.680" end="01:02:33.690" style="s2">your sight and your vision and your</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.750" end="01:02:35.940" style="s2">touch and your sense of your body in</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.690" end="01:02:38.100" style="s2">space are all integrated in the thalamus</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.940" end="01:02:41.130" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of information coming</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.100" end="01:02:43.260" style="s2">in from all of your senses okay now</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.130" end="01:02:44.970" style="s2">imagine that your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.260" end="01:02:45.450" style="s2">which is a relatively new part of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.970" end="01:02:49.110" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.450" end="01:02:51.570" style="s2">it sets up a plan what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.110" end="01:02:54.630" style="s2">do next and it tells the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.570" end="01:02:58.800" style="s2">only let information relevant to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.630" end="01:03:00.510" style="s2">plan through into consciousness so for</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.800" end="01:03:01.770" style="s2">example if you walk into the kitchen and</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.510" end="01:03:04.380" style="s2">you&#39;re going to make yourself something</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.770" end="01:03:06.420" style="s2">to eat you&#39;re not going to notice the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.380" end="01:03:08.280" style="s2">floor and you&#39;re not going to notice the</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.420" end="01:03:10.530" style="s2">paint on the ceiling you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.280" end="01:03:12.690" style="s2">notice the refrigerator and the stove</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.530" end="01:03:16.080" style="s2">and the few implements that you need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.690" end="01:03:18.680" style="s2">undertake the task related to eating so</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.080" end="01:03:21.000" style="s2">the prefrontal cortex gates the Salamis</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.680" end="01:03:23.130" style="s2">now there&#39;s a million things you could</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.000" end="01:03:24.600" style="s2">pay attention to in the kitchen if the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.130" end="01:03:28.020" style="s2">kitchen is a very complex visual</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.600" end="01:03:31.620" style="s2">environment if you take a hallucinogenic</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.020" end="01:03:34.350" style="s2">drug it inhibits the prefrontal cortexes</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.620" end="01:03:36.990" style="s2">capacity to gate the thalamus and all</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.350" end="01:03:40.740" style="s2">sorts of sensory information flows</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.990" end="01:03:43.350" style="s2">through now most of the time when you</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.740" end="01:03:46.440" style="s2">look at the world you hardly see any of</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.350" end="01:03:48.870" style="s2">it you filter it out yes exactly your</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.440" end="01:03:50.700" style="s2">brain is exactly as Aldous Huxley</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.870" end="01:03:53.640" style="s2">proposed your brain is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.700" end="01:03:57.300" style="s2">sequence of extremely extremely complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.640" end="01:04:01.470" style="s2">filtering mechanisms and most of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.300" end="01:04:04.500" style="s2">out there is eliminated well following</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.470" end="01:04:07.920" style="s2">on volunter ground of mystical</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.500" end="01:04:11.900" style="s2">experience is the partial apprehension</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:17.460" style="s2">of the richness of potential experience</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.900" end="01:04:19.470" style="s2">beyond beyond what&#39;s expected so when</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.460" end="01:04:21.720" style="s2">you look at the world what you see is</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.470" end="01:04:24.360" style="s2">mostly relevant to your current plan and</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.720" end="01:04:28.500" style="s2">shape to a tremendous degree by your</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.360" end="01:04:30.750" style="s2">memory and if if those systems are</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.500" end="01:04:32.700" style="s2">inhibited or shut down in some way and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.750" end="01:04:35.190" style="s2">you have the opportunity to apprehend</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.700" end="01:04:37.150" style="s2">what&#39;s actually there what this</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.190" end="01:04:39.099" style="s2">sensation it produces</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.150" end="01:04:42.369" style="s2">which is the disinhibition of certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.099" end="01:04:47.410" style="s2">kinds of emotion is very much associated</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.369" end="01:04:49.690" style="s2">with what people describe as aw no I</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.410" end="01:04:52.329" style="s2">would say to here here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.690" end="01:04:56.260" style="s2">interesting in that regard you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.329" end="01:05:00.520" style="s2">people say people ask themselves for</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.260" end="01:05:03.460" style="s2">example do you believe in God and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.520" end="01:05:07.960" style="s2">would say that&#39;s actually a nonsensical</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.460" end="01:05:11.589" style="s2">question I would say whether or not you</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.960" end="01:05:15.069" style="s2">believe in God you&#39;re more or less stuck</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.589" end="01:05:17.170" style="s2">with him he&#39;s there whether you believe</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.069" end="01:05:19.569" style="s2">it or not and it has nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.170" end="01:05:22.930" style="s2">belief and I&#39;ll tell you why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.569" end="01:05:25.260" style="s2">actually straightforward okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.930" end="01:05:30.279" style="s2">go back to the ancient Israelis</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.260" end="01:05:32.109" style="s2">Israelites now they had some rules they</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.279" end="01:05:35.710" style="s2">believed that there was a unity behind</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.109" end="01:05:38.680" style="s2">everything and that unity was unnameable</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.710" end="01:05:43.390" style="s2">so it was against the rules to speak the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.680" end="01:05:45.250" style="s2">name of God why well because as soon as</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.390" end="01:05:47.140" style="s2">you speak the name of something you</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.250" end="01:05:50.410" style="s2">categorize it and it is its</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.140" end="01:05:52.750" style="s2">categorizable and understandable then</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.410" end="01:05:54.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not the totality it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.750" end="01:05:58.210" style="s2">you&#39;ve parceled off and made into a</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.700" end="01:06:01.510" style="s2">concept the totality of being is beyond</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.210" end="01:06:04.510" style="s2">all conceptualization okay so then you</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.510" end="01:06:07.210" style="s2">might ask yourself well is there a</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.510" end="01:06:09.299" style="s2">totality of being well the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.210" end="01:06:13.029" style="s2">that is well obviously because</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.299" end="01:06:16.270" style="s2">everything there is sums up to one</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.029" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">totality well what&#39;s the nature of that</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.270" end="01:06:22.470" style="s2">totality well it&#39;s unutterable you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:25.630" style="s2">say it&#39;s too complex it&#39;s too rich it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.470" end="01:06:29.619" style="s2">it&#39;s not within human ability to grasp</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.630" end="01:06:32.910" style="s2">is it there well it&#39;s there just like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.619" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">room contains the objects in the room</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.910" end="01:06:39.730" style="s2">it&#39;s there for sure okay so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:41.020" style="s2">totality that&#39;s unnameable the next</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.730" end="01:06:43.420" style="s2">question would be well do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.020" end="01:06:44.470" style="s2">relationship with it well the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.420" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">that is of course you have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.470" end="01:06:49.569" style="s2">relationship with it because every part</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:50.350" style="s2">has a relationship to the whole because</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.569" end="01:06:53.380" style="s2">you&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.350" end="01:06:57.400" style="s2">basically well and then you&#39;re here in</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.380" end="01:06:58.870" style="s2">Erie you&#39;re inside the totality now then</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.400" end="01:07:01.210" style="s2">you might ask but what&#39;s the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.870" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">your relationship with that totality and</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.210" end="01:07:06.640" style="s2">I would say well you tell me it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:10.270" style="s2">to know is your life rich and meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.640" end="01:07:12.400" style="s2">and worthy of sustaining and in your own</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.270" end="01:07:14.680" style="s2">from your own perspective do you believe</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.400" end="01:07:16.270" style="s2">that life is worthwhile you live it in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.680" end="01:07:18.730" style="s2">manner that makes it worthwhile</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.270" end="01:07:20.110" style="s2">and if answer that is yes then I would</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.730" end="01:07:22.810" style="s2">say well you have the proper</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.110" end="01:07:25.690" style="s2">relationship with the totality and if</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.810" end="01:07:27.520" style="s2">answer is no you doubt the value of life</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.690" end="01:07:30.220" style="s2">you&#39;re hostile and resentful you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.520" end="01:07:32.260" style="s2">bored you&#39;re afraid you&#39;re hurt</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.220" end="01:07:35.230" style="s2">well then there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.260" end="01:07:37.560" style="s2">your relationship with the totality well</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.230" end="01:07:41.890" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s so complicated about that</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.560" end="01:07:44.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s self-evident and</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.890" end="01:07:47.040" style="s2">it&#39;s stunning to me that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.050" end="01:07:49.990" style="s2">subject of so much constant dispute</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.040" end="01:07:51.880" style="s2">now you might object well you have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.990" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">relationship with the totality but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.880" end="01:07:57.400" style="s2">not a personal relationship which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:59.500" style="s2">what the ancient Israelites claimed and</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.400" end="01:08:01.000" style="s2">of course what the Protestant</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.500" end="01:08:04.180" style="s2">Protestants claimed even more</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.000" end="01:08:07.180" style="s2">dramatically and I would say well you</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.180" end="01:08:11.710" style="s2">could be right but let&#39;s consider it an</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.180" end="01:08:13.930" style="s2">experiment here&#39;s the experiment try to</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.710" end="01:08:15.640" style="s2">establish a personal relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.930" end="01:08:18.730" style="s2">this totality and here&#39;s here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.640" end="01:08:20.500" style="s2">criteria I will say that whenever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.730" end="01:08:23.320" style="s2">doing something that&#39;s intensely</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.500" end="01:08:25.450" style="s2">meaningful then you&#39;ve established a</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.320" end="01:08:28.300" style="s2">personal relationship with this totality</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.450" end="01:08:30.180" style="s2">and if all you ever did were things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.300" end="01:08:32.830" style="s2">were intensely personally meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.180" end="01:08:34.720" style="s2">while you&#39;d live an ideal life and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.830" end="01:08:37.470" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be afraid of death and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.720" end="01:08:40.180" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t become bitter and resentful and</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.470" end="01:08:41.650" style="s2">it&#39;s also doable I think with every</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.180" end="01:08:43.570" style="s2">choice you make you decide whether</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.650" end="01:08:46.180" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do that or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.570" end="01:08:48.460" style="s2">difficult to do meaningful things</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.180" end="01:08:51.790" style="s2">everybody doesn&#39;t always agree with them</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.460" end="01:08:56.700" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of idiosyncratic there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.790" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">necessary reason that you&#39;ll be rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.700" end="01:09:02.639" style="s2">by the culture with material success if</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:04.889" style="s2">you do meaningful things</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.639" end="01:09:07.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s a shot in the dark it&#39;s a leap</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.889" end="01:09:09.000" style="s2">of faith but it&#39;s right within your</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.080" end="01:09:11.279" style="s2">grasp you can you can do it just by</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.000" end="01:09:14.190" style="s2">deciding to well what I learned from</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.279" end="01:09:17.790" style="s2">writing maps of meaning was that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.190" end="01:09:19.969" style="s2">fate of the world literally depends on</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.790" end="01:09:22.469" style="s2">the choice that each individual makes</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.969" end="01:09:25.469" style="s2">with regards to their relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.469" end="01:09:28.350" style="s2">the totality of being and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.469" end="01:09:30.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that&#39;s the central</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.350" end="01:09:31.859" style="s2">message of profound religious systems</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.330" end="01:09:35.400" style="s2">says there&#39;s more to you than you think</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.859" end="01:09:37.799" style="s2">a lot more there&#39;s more to more for evil</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.400" end="01:09:40.380" style="s2">way more than you think and there&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.799" end="01:09:42.060" style="s2">more for good and whether you know it or</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.380" end="01:09:44.130" style="s2">not you&#39;re always choosing between those</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.060" end="01:09:46.350" style="s2">two and whether you know it or not the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.130" end="01:09:49.710" style="s2">fate of being itself rests on your</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.350" end="01:09:52.920" style="s2">choice well who the hell wants to</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.710" end="01:09:54.869" style="s2">believe that exactly we do wait it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.920" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">weighty well I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.869" end="01:09:59.219" style="s2">weighty or not when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.360" end="01:10:02.489" style="s2">investigate the reasons behind something</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.219" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">like the Holocaust things get weighty</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.489" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">very rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.840" end="01:10:11.010" style="s2">what about 9/11 the the shock of people</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:13.920" style="s2">seeing that unfold on their TV screens</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.010" end="01:10:17.540" style="s2">or people who were there now that was a</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:21.300" style="s2">group experience it wasn&#39;t an individual</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.540" end="01:10:28.290" style="s2">just purely individual experience how do</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.300" end="01:10:32.070" style="s2">you think we handled that well I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.290" end="01:10:35.310" style="s2">you can think of two recent events uh in</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.070" end="01:10:38.429" style="s2">an illuminating way 9/11 would be one</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.310" end="01:10:42.900" style="s2">and the flooding of New Orleans would be</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.429" end="01:10:45.060" style="s2">another so with regards to 9/11 the most</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.900" end="01:10:49.699" style="s2">interesting thing to note about people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.060" end="01:10:53.550" style="s2">responses to that catastrophe was their</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.699" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">unconscious need for repetition I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.550" end="01:10:59.360" style="s2">everyone I know watched the Trade Towers</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:11:05.100" style="s2">fall 50 times or a hundred times in</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.360" end="01:11:07.199" style="s2">shark unable not to watch and I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.100" end="01:11:09.300" style="s2">the reason that that&#39;s so illuminating</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.199" end="01:11:13.179" style="s2">is because it shows you how complicated</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.300" end="01:11:16.429" style="s2">it is to see what you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.179" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">so mythologically speaking the fall of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.429" end="01:11:21.139" style="s2">the towers was equivalent both to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:24.110" style="s2">death of the king and to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.139" end="01:11:27.199" style="s2">re-emergence of chaos and when the King</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.110" end="01:11:30.409" style="s2">dies and chaos Ria&#39;s it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.199" end="01:11:33.560" style="s2">to see what&#39;s there and I&#39;m not speaking</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.409" end="01:11:35.719" style="s2">metaphorically precisely people wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.560" end="01:11:39.460" style="s2">have had to watch the Towers fall over</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.719" end="01:11:43.250" style="s2">and over if they could see them fall and</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.460" end="01:11:46.969" style="s2">on a trivial level a building collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.250" end="01:11:50.150" style="s2">but what the events that characterized</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.969" end="01:11:53.719" style="s2">9/11 were far more than merely a</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.150" end="01:11:56.719" style="s2">building falling when the event happened</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.719" end="01:11:59.690" style="s2">no one knew what fell no one knew if the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:02.780" style="s2">financial system fell no one knew if the</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.690" end="01:12:07.280" style="s2">economic system fell no one knew if the</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.780" end="01:12:09.440" style="s2">world order had collapsed and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.280" end="01:12:12.409" style="s2">watching those buildings fall was trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.440" end="01:12:15.260" style="s2">to perceive all those others of levels</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.409" end="01:12:18.710" style="s2">of reality at the same time well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.260" end="01:12:22.250" style="s2">really really complicated well and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.710" end="01:12:24.380" style="s2">Bush offered people and easy-out and a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.250" end="01:12:27.440" style="s2">prepared way out he said well the people</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.380" end="01:12:29.810" style="s2">who did this were evil and perhaps they</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.440" end="01:12:33.830" style="s2">were the people who did this were evil</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.810" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">we&#39;re good there should be a war now as</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.830" end="01:12:38.510" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:41.449" style="s2">mythological explanation and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.510" end="01:12:44.210" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy for people to instantly</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.449" end="01:12:48.739" style="s2">put forth a mythological explanation</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.210" end="01:12:50.840" style="s2">when chaos makes itself manifest well of</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.739" end="01:12:54.500" style="s2">course the problem with our response to</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.840" end="01:13:01.370" style="s2">9/11 was that air almost every bit of it</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.500" end="01:13:06.860" style="s2">was a lie um we know that the American</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.370" end="01:13:10.100" style="s2">government utilized the events of 9/11</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.860" end="01:13:12.050" style="s2">to justify an invasion on Iraq that had</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.100" end="01:13:14.870" style="s2">been planned at least 10 years before</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.050" end="01:13:17.780" style="s2">the historical documentation of that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.870" end="01:13:19.699" style="s2">is available from the people who did the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.780" end="01:13:22.239" style="s2">planning they&#39;re still part of Bush&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.699" end="01:13:22.239" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.230" end="01:13:33.860" style="s2">so you asked about our response</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.070" end="01:13:36.410" style="s2">well you can&#39;t I mean I think when Bush</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.860" end="01:13:38.570" style="s2">first went into Iraq people had a</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.410" end="01:13:40.700" style="s2">legitimate debate about what should be</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.570" end="01:13:42.530" style="s2">done about tyrants like Saddam Hussein</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.700" end="01:13:47.120" style="s2">because he was obviously a horrible</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.530" end="01:13:52.880" style="s2">person and his sons were even worse but</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.120" end="01:13:55.220" style="s2">the idea that a catastrophe consisting</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.880" end="01:13:58.550" style="s2">of the re-emergence of chaos could be</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.220" end="01:13:59.870" style="s2">met by dissimulation and conscious lies</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.550" end="01:14:03.800" style="s2">and that that would work out</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.870" end="01:14:08.540" style="s2">successfully well that&#39;s I would say</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.800" end="01:14:11.240" style="s2">that&#39;s willfully blind corrupt and naive</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.540" end="01:14:13.280" style="s2">all at the same time and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.240" end="01:14:15.280" style="s2">characterized our response right wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.280" end="01:14:18.830" style="s2">that response plan by a group who</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.280" end="01:14:21.590" style="s2">disciples and followers of a philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.830" end="01:14:23.480" style="s2">called Strauss is that correct yes</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.590" end="01:14:26.450" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right and they had</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.480" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">put a manifesto together that are back</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.450" end="01:14:32.420" style="s2">in the mid 1990s I mean the hope had</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:36.290" style="s2">written Clinton you know are expressing</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.420" end="01:14:37.850" style="s2">their their need to invade Iraq which</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.290" end="01:14:39.980" style="s2">which I don&#39;t really think is the issue</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.850" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">like I said because Saddam Hussein was a</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.980" end="01:14:45.170" style="s2">terrible person and it isn&#39;t clear that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:47.740" style="s2">the international community exactly</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.170" end="01:14:53.210" style="s2">knows what to do with barbaric dictators</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.740" end="01:14:55.250" style="s2">the problem wasn&#39;t necessarily the idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.210" end="01:14:58.820" style="s2">that going after Saddam Hussein was</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.250" end="01:15:00.800" style="s2">justified the problem was that an event</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.820" end="01:15:05.270" style="s2">that had absolutely nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:07.820" style="s2">him was utilized in an absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.270" end="01:15:10.640" style="s2">deceitful manner by people who had a</p>

<p begin="01:17:13.970" end="01:17:19.010" style="s2">to Noah was the re-emergence of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.190" end="01:17:20.540" style="s2">because of a corrupt social order well</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.010" end="01:17:24.440" style="s2">the same thing happened in New Orleans</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.540" end="01:17:26.840" style="s2">on the one hand it was a storm so the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.440" end="01:17:28.490" style="s2">storm caused the flooding but on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.840" end="01:17:30.200" style="s2">other hand had the levees being four</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.490" end="01:17:32.960" style="s2">feet higher there wouldn&#39;t have been a</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.200" end="01:17:35.690" style="s2">catastrophe so the fact that there was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.960" end="01:17:39.650" style="s2">flooded New Orleans is as much evidence</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.690" end="01:17:43.700" style="s2">that order was insufficient to hold</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.650" end="01:17:46.040" style="s2">chaos back as it is evidence that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.700" end="01:17:48.699" style="s2">chaotic hand of God is perfectly capable</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.040" end="01:17:51.710" style="s2">of causing natural disasters</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.699" end="01:17:54.679" style="s2">there was too much disorder there on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.710" end="01:17:56.810" style="s2">side of order exactly they&#39;re too much</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.679" end="01:17:59.980" style="s2">and it was not just disorder but</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.810" end="01:18:02.989" style="s2">corruption right so it&#39;s archaic</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.980" end="01:18:05.929" style="s2">cultural systems they the levees they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.989" end="01:18:07.790" style="s2">too old and starting to deteriorate so</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.929" end="01:18:11.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a deteriorate of their own</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.790" end="01:18:12.650" style="s2">accord plus the deterioration is sped</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.060" end="01:18:14.060" style="s2">along by the fact that the people who</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.650" end="01:18:15.530" style="s2">are putative Lee in charge of them</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.060" end="01:18:18.290" style="s2">aren&#39;t taking the responsibilities</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.530" end="01:18:19.820" style="s2">seriously on a similar matter for sure</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.290" end="01:18:22.940" style="s2">on a similar basis it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.820" end="01:18:27.260" style="s2">flooding but it that reminds me in</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.940" end="01:18:29.780" style="s2">Australia on the in certain beaches that</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.260" end="01:18:33.500" style="s2">have been shark attacks where they have</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.780" end="01:18:35.780" style="s2">shark fences out in the in the sea which</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.500" end="01:18:38.090" style="s2">have not been repaired and there are</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.780" end="01:18:40.040" style="s2">holes in the fences and so sharks are</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.090" end="01:18:43.580" style="s2">getting through and attacking surfers is</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.040" end="01:18:45.679" style="s2">exactly the same the same right and</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.580" end="01:18:47.510" style="s2">that&#39;s in fact you know I would say the</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.679" end="01:18:50.860" style="s2">reason that example popped into your</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.510" end="01:18:53.000" style="s2">mind is because of the mythological</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.860" end="01:18:55.880" style="s2">equivalence you see because the</p>

<p begin="01:18:55.880" end="01:19:03.800" style="s2">devouring underwater creature is a prime</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.590" end="01:19:06.590" style="s2">mythological representation of chaos so</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.800" end="01:19:08.420" style="s2">for example time out in the ANU mulisch</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.590" end="01:19:11.480" style="s2">who&#39;s basically the model for the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.420" end="01:19:14.150" style="s2">leviathan is an underwater dragon an</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.480" end="01:19:16.909" style="s2">underwater devouring dragon and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.150" end="01:19:19.250" style="s2">this prime symbol of chaos and so I</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.909" end="01:19:21.290" style="s2">would say your example was brought to</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.250" end="01:19:23.420" style="s2">mind by the mythological equivalent</p>

<p begin="01:19:26.420" end="01:19:32.330" style="s2">been a great pleasure hearing you</p>

<p begin="01:19:34.159" end="01:19:39.110" style="s2">this book is available well I would say</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.710" end="01:19:43.130" style="s2">the simplest place to find it is at</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.110" end="01:19:46.640" style="s2">Amazon if you go to my website which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.130" end="01:19:49.520" style="s2">maps of meaning calm right there are</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.640" end="01:19:52.940" style="s2">lectures on the book televised by</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.520" end="01:19:55.909" style="s2">Canadian Public Television and links to</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.940" end="01:19:58.600" style="s2">places the book can be purchased so</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.909" end="01:20:00.319" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the simplest thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.600" end="01:20:02.449" style="s2">okay and</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.989" end="01:20:18.699" style="s2">now well I&#39;ve written recently a few</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.749" end="01:20:23.169" style="s2">papers on the nature of self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.699" end="01:20:26.149" style="s2">which is a very paradoxical concept</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.169" end="01:20:28.789" style="s2">self-deception implies that at least in</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.149" end="01:20:30.319" style="s2">its classical formulations that a person</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.789" end="01:20:32.859" style="s2">knows something and doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.319" end="01:20:35.899" style="s2">something at the same time which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.859" end="01:20:37.639" style="s2">problematic conceptually for a variety</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.899" end="01:20:42.079" style="s2">of reasons I&#39;ve been trying to crack</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.639" end="01:20:44.839" style="s2">that problem I&#39;ve also been attempting</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.079" end="01:20:47.749" style="s2">to recast our models of</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.839" end="01:20:50.469" style="s2">neuropsychological functioning</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.749" end="01:20:54.469" style="s2">starting from the presupposition that</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.469" end="01:20:57.159" style="s2">what the mind encounters is much more</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.469" end="01:21:00.439" style="s2">properly conceptualized as an</p>

<p begin="01:21:00.439" end="01:21:06.499" style="s2">than it is conceptualized as a place of</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.079" end="01:21:10.309" style="s2">material objects and that&#39;s following to</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.499" end="01:21:13.999" style="s2">some degree the ideas of the physicist</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.309" end="01:21:17.649" style="s2">wheeler who is a student of Niels Bohr I</p>

<p begin="01:21:38.389" end="01:21:44.749" style="s2">in quantum physics where the observer</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.030" end="01:21:47.299" style="s2">actually causes the event to happen well</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.749" end="01:21:51.709" style="s2">it does seem related to that in some</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.299" end="01:21:54.229" style="s2">manner and and I I believe that um that</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.709" end="01:21:56.809" style="s2">idea is linked to the notion I described</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.229" end="01:21:58.760" style="s2">earlier about the capacity of human</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.809" end="01:22:01.789" style="s2">consciousness to make order out of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.760" end="01:22:03.859" style="s2">like I personally believe and this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.789" end="01:22:07.519" style="s2">partly because of what I&#39;ve learned from</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.859" end="01:22:10.999" style="s2">reading religious mythology that human</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.519" end="01:22:14.060" style="s2">consciousness realizes the world in in</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.999" end="01:22:17.450" style="s2">some non metaphorical sense I cried I</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.060" end="01:22:20.630" style="s2">not a materialist and I truly believe</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.450" end="01:22:23.900" style="s2">that if human consciousness did not</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.630" end="01:22:27.860" style="s2">exist the idea that there would be</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.900" end="01:22:29.990" style="s2">existence is is in some manner wrong I</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.860" end="01:22:33.500" style="s2">think existence is dependent on</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.990" end="01:22:36.850" style="s2">consciousness and I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.500" end="01:22:40.340" style="s2">work out the implications of that idea</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.850" end="01:22:43.310" style="s2">in a scientifically rigorous manner and</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.340" end="01:22:44.630" style="s2">that constitutes partly what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.310" end="01:22:48.200" style="s2">writing about recently</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.630" end="01:22:52.520" style="s2">that sounds very very interesting and of</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.200" end="01:22:55.490" style="s2">course we all take for granted if you or</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.520" end="01:22:57.560" style="s2">I can sit here and talk about let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.490" end="01:23:02.390" style="s2">about for instance think of the first</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.560" end="01:23:05.150" style="s2">world war okay and we think that this</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.390" end="01:23:07.850" style="s2">happened that happened etc you can think</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.150" end="01:23:12.220" style="s2">about the Great Depression neither you</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.850" end="01:23:15.380" style="s2">nor I were alive at the time Yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.220" end="01:23:19.130" style="s2">but we take it for granted that it</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.380" end="01:23:22.670" style="s2">happened yeah now if you go from now</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.130" end="01:23:27.260" style="s2">today and you go forward a hundred years</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.670" end="01:23:31.220" style="s2">neither you nor I will be alive then but</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.260" end="01:23:33.590" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t worry us should it well I</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.220" end="01:23:36.290" style="s2">would say that the fact of our being</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.590" end="01:23:41.740" style="s2">would still be embedded in the matrix of</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.290" end="01:23:45.830" style="s2">reality right right we because the</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.740" end="01:23:48.470" style="s2">things fold up in a way the past folds</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.830" end="01:23:51.740" style="s2">up and is still present in the present</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.470" end="01:23:55.310" style="s2">and the future is not yet unfolded</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.740" end="01:24:00.890" style="s2">implicit in the present and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.310" end="01:24:02.720" style="s2">just as none of your deeds do you just</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.890" end="01:24:06.350" style="s2">as you cannot escape from the</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.720" end="01:24:10.340" style="s2">consequences of any of your deeds the</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.350" end="01:24:13.130" style="s2">record of your being and and the nature</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.340" end="01:24:17.540" style="s2">of that being is embedded in the fabric</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.130" end="01:24:21.080" style="s2">of reality permanently because possibly</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.540" end="01:24:23.990" style="s2">what we conceive as a timeline is a</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.080" end="01:24:26.460" style="s2">man-made abstraction maybe there is no</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.990" end="01:24:29.100" style="s2">such thing as time</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.460" end="01:24:30.690" style="s2">well there is for us and but what that</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.100" end="01:24:33.990" style="s2">means in some ultimate sense is</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.690" end="01:24:35.550" style="s2">obviously not our conceptually</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.990" end="01:24:38.450" style="s2">accessible to us</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.550" end="01:24:41.460" style="s2">I think that&#39;s part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.450" end="01:24:43.560" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to realize that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.460" end="01:24:47.900" style="s2">implications of your behavior and your</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.560" end="01:24:50.520" style="s2">conceptions reverberate far past you</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.900" end="01:24:53.190" style="s2">things are not necessarily precisely</p>
