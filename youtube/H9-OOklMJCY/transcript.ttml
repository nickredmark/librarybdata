<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">really I guess this sounds a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.210" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">too 1968 but I really got into it I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">it was really enriching and enrapturing</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">and I really appreciated that a lot so I</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">term for those of you who want to commit</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">to the wisdom Sangha you need to order</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">this book the wisdom of Hypatia by Brian</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:02:00.590" style="s2">McClennan okay and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:00.590" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.740" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">relatively inexpensively on Amazon so</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">please consider doing that as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:12.410" style="s2">you can because we&#39;re going to be moving</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:12.410" style="s2">towards that in the summer</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.600" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">okay so today is a dharma day and what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.690" end="00:02:20.970" style="s2">want to do is show you a Siddha practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:24.330" style="s2">but it&#39;s this particular type of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.970" end="00:02:26.520" style="s2">practice so I&#39;m also going to start</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.330" end="00:02:28.410" style="s2">teaching you some of the principles by</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.520" end="00:02:31.740" style="s2">which you construct an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.410" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">practices because I want it to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:37.490" style="s2">that I are not offering any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">exclusive ecology I&#39;m offering a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.490" end="00:02:44.430" style="s2">philosophically grounded pluralism which</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:46.350" style="s2">is there&#39;s shared principles that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.430" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">that are grounded both in the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.350" end="00:02:50.850" style="s2">cognitive science and convergence from</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">the wisdom traditions but each one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.850" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">those principles can be enacted by</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:57.570" style="s2">various families of practices and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:59.610" style="s2">want to put them together in a fashion</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.570" end="00:03:02.190" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;ll talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.610" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">you want various practices to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.190" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">complementary relationship they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">corresponding corresponding strengths</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">and weaknesses well it&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:14.100" style="s2">that design feature within this ecology</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">that I&#39;m showing you so far because we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.100" end="00:03:17.690" style="s2">have we have a complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:21.300" style="s2">relationship between meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.690" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">contemplation they have a compensate for</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.300" end="00:03:24.900" style="s2">each other they self correct for each</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">other so you want to be looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.900" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">relate and we have set in still</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:31.560" style="s2">practices and then moving practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:35.130" style="s2">right complementary relationships right</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.560" end="00:03:36.930" style="s2">so that enhances the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.130" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">whole ecology to be as self-correcting</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.930" end="00:03:42.800" style="s2">as possible we also have layering</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">practices where we take a practice and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.800" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">like we build a one-layer practices and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">then we exact it up into a higher order</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">of practice what&#39;s an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">Praja right we have we take meta and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:57.960" style="s2">past night and we integrate them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:04:00.180" style="s2">then they get exact it up into Praja and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.960" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">then you&#39;re linking practices practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.180" end="00:04:05.010" style="s2">that are designed to bridge and help you</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">to transition between practices and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.010" end="00:04:08.430" style="s2">smoothly let&#39;s take an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:11.580" style="s2">the clear example of that is Lexi o</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.430" end="00:04:14.490" style="s2">Divina which helps to transition and get</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.580" end="00:04:17.220" style="s2">via logos and the mindfulness practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.490" end="00:04:18.480" style="s2">is to talk to each other so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.220" end="00:04:21.030" style="s2">giving you another one of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.480" end="00:04:23.640" style="s2">practices that&#39;s both a linking and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.030" end="00:04:25.590" style="s2">bit of a layering practice so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.640" end="00:04:26.100" style="s2">designed to be it&#39;s a sitting practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.590" end="00:04:28.530" style="s2">but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.100" end="00:04:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s an moving practice so it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.530" end="00:04:32.700" style="s2">to bridge between you know the standing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.020" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">and we&#39;ll eventually do some meditative</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.700" end="00:04:39.450" style="s2">walking right moving practices and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">sitted practice okay so one more time</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.450" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">let&#39;s review some of the devant and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:45.000" style="s2">design principles and I say almost said</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">divine principles I wonder if that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.000" end="00:04:50.550" style="s2">union slip of some kind so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:52.380" style="s2">looking for relationships of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.550" end="00:04:55.230" style="s2">complementarity so you get dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.380" end="00:04:56.820" style="s2">self-correction you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.230" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">relationships layering so you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.820" end="00:05:02.010" style="s2">dynamical development and excitation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:04.740" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for relations of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.010" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">transition so that you get dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.740" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">progression between the practices okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:16.410" style="s2">so what is that practice well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:18.480" style="s2">form of Chi con but its influence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.410" end="00:05:21.720" style="s2">influenced significantly also by</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.480" end="00:05:24.060" style="s2">Kundalini and so you&#39;ll some of you who</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.720" end="00:05:27.150" style="s2">do chakra work as I&#39;ve mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.060" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t get too much out of the chakra</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.150" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">system and I&#39;ve practiced Kundalini bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:35.130" style="s2">I haven&#39;t had once in my life and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it means I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.130" end="00:05:39.240" style="s2">helpful to me that that&#39;s I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.590" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">to like set it up as and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.240" end="00:05:43.260" style="s2">experienced a sort of a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:45.350" style="s2">Kundalini experience so I have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.260" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">sense of what what&#39;s going on there but</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.350" end="00:05:49.650" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to put so much emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:53.400" style="s2">that I&#39;m going to put an emphasis more</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.650" end="00:05:56.010" style="s2">on how that gets integrated with the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.400" end="00:05:58.260" style="s2">Taoist practices because that will more</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.010" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">smoothly integrate with ecology</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.260" end="00:06:04.220" style="s2">practices so let me describe it to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:06.930" style="s2">and there&#39;s sort of two things to it too</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.220" end="00:06:09.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of a more of movement of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.930" end="00:06:11.580" style="s2">body and then movement of mind and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.330" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">the movement of mind won&#39;t be that form</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.580" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">to you so I&#39;m going to describe each one</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:18.120" style="s2">to you and I&#39;ll demonstrate a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:19.890" style="s2">please keep your eyes open and watch</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.120" end="00:06:22.920" style="s2">because then we&#39;ll do it together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.890" end="00:06:25.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll also talk you through it okay so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.920" end="00:06:27.630" style="s2">the first like this right so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.200" end="00:06:31.350" style="s2">we we&#39;ve we&#39;ve done you know we brought</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.630" end="00:06:33.270" style="s2">down the heavens and now we sit okay so</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.350" end="00:06:35.310" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna put our hands in front of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.270" end="00:06:37.940" style="s2">our face like this and we lift her and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.310" end="00:06:39.810" style="s2">you&#39;ll recognize you see how this links</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.940" end="00:06:43.290" style="s2">to what you&#39;ve already do</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.810" end="00:06:45.150" style="s2">so I do ah alright inhale and then I</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.380" end="00:10:13.240" style="s2">expand to the horizon and then as you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.790" end="00:10:15.640" style="s2">exhale you contract to the core and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.240" end="00:10:17.950" style="s2">in the pause between breaths you drop to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.640" end="00:10:22.920" style="s2">the centre of your skull your head</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.790" end="00:12:41.459" style="s2">activating fundamentally different areas</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.519" end="00:12:44.129" style="s2">sort of stratum of the brain and so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.459" end="00:12:46.589" style="s2">this these kinds of practices are sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.129" end="00:12:48.300" style="s2">of trying to point towards some really</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.589" end="00:12:49.860" style="s2">good cognitive sciences to support their</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.300" end="00:12:51.480" style="s2">functionality so we start with their</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.860" end="00:12:54.329" style="s2">hands in front like this we lift our</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.480" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">head up and we&#39;re doing it on again like</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.789" end="00:33:07.210" style="s2">the shakuhachi but time and financial</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.210" end="00:33:10.679" style="s2">a life of their own and went another way</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.499" end="00:33:16.330" style="s2">and I couldn&#39;t do it but most definitely</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.330" end="00:33:19.779" style="s2">is your recommendation we do this move</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.859" end="00:33:23.259" style="s2">it&#39;s moving see to practice before the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.779" end="00:33:25.359" style="s2">court for yes yes exactly exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.259" end="00:33:27.879" style="s2">thank you Kelly that&#39;s exactly so this</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.359" end="00:33:29.559" style="s2">is you know this is a linking practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.879" end="00:33:33.669" style="s2">it&#39;s designed to help you transition</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.559" end="00:33:36.369" style="s2">from the standing and moving Qigong into</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.669" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">sit into sit and then you can go into</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.369" end="00:33:42.519" style="s2">the court but you&#39;ll find especially the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">routing and the flowing right have been</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.519" end="00:33:47.379" style="s2">prepared there already through activated</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:50.109" style="s2">and partially actualized there in</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.379" end="00:33:53.139" style="s2">potentia actually right there actualized</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.109" end="00:33:54.969" style="s2">potential on the beginning to flow and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.139" end="00:33:57.249" style="s2">so you&#39;ll find that there&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.969" end="00:34:00.429" style="s2">there&#39;s layering as well so doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.249" end="00:34:03.429" style="s2">practice will layer into the core for in</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.429" end="00:34:05.589" style="s2">a powerful way remember when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.429" end="00:34:07.929" style="s2">doing that breathing pront all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.589" end="00:34:09.609" style="s2">breathing aspect although you&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.929" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">your breath and you&#39;re doing and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.609" end="00:34:12.609" style="s2">don&#39;t hyperventilate</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:14.139" style="s2">you don&#39;t hyperventilate so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.609" end="00:34:16.599" style="s2">getting lightheaded you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.139" end="00:34:18.609" style="s2">hyperventilating and you need to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.599" end="00:34:22.869" style="s2">sort of the intensity of the effort and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.609" end="00:34:24.700" style="s2">the extremes of the breathing okay I</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.869" end="00:34:28.510" style="s2">will review this like I&#39;ll talk you</p>
