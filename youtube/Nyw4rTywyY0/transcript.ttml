<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">insightful on a great many subjects but</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.950" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">we would like to see the questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.079" end="00:03:40.349" style="s2">relevant to tonight&#39;s topic so and with</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">that I think I&#39;ll just start a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.349" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">bit about myself before being elected</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:50.269" style="s2">before entering politics I like many</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:53.820" style="s2">other people was increasingly getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.269" end="00:03:56.130" style="s2">disappointed with the that the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.820" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">government was conducting itself would</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:04.050" style="s2">ever increasing government laws the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:08.520" style="s2">rules the regulations that in my view</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.050" end="00:04:11.700" style="s2">were unduly infringing on what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.520" end="00:04:16.680" style="s2">considered my own personal jurisdiction</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:20.489" style="s2">my own personal responsibility and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.680" end="00:04:23.990" style="s2">also how these increasing role of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.489" end="00:04:28.280" style="s2">government was shifting in altering</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.990" end="00:04:30.919" style="s2">society in ways that I felt</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:36.770" style="s2">uncomfortable with that I felt were</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.919" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">contrary to my beliefs in my values and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.770" end="00:04:45.090" style="s2">like most people I grumbled about it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:48.630" style="s2">grumbled and spoke with other people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.090" end="00:04:50.820" style="s2">grumbled about things but we didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.630" end="00:04:56.550" style="s2">very much about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.820" end="00:05:00.900" style="s2">we just bored green and Bohr and the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.550" end="00:05:06.510" style="s2">ever-increasing role of government but</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.900" end="00:05:11.130" style="s2">back in 2002 very fortunately I came</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.510" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">across a few other fellows who had very</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">much same attitudes and views as myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:24.300" style="s2">and in 2002 four of us four of us met</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">around a kitchen table at Merle and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.300" end="00:05:27.090" style="s2">Ruth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:30.660" style="s2">Beau&#39;s home owed on the concession for</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.090" end="00:05:34.410" style="s2">of Ramsey and we decided that it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.660" end="00:05:37.320" style="s2">time to act now none of us actually knew</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.410" end="00:05:41.580" style="s2">what that meant none of us had actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.320" end="00:05:45.450" style="s2">ever done anything about government but</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:47.310" style="s2">we knew that we needed to speak out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.450" end="00:05:50.039" style="s2">we knew that we needed to make a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.310" end="00:05:52.830" style="s2">difference so we formed formed a group</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.039" end="00:05:57.169" style="s2">and we called it the lanark landowners</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.830" end="00:06:00.390" style="s2">Association and I was asked to be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.169" end="00:06:05.060" style="s2">spokesperson and the president of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.390" end="00:06:05.060" style="s2">new Association of four people</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.150" end="00:06:13.690" style="s2">and then of course we said that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.650" end="00:06:17.230" style="s2">now what do we do well we decided to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.690" end="00:06:19.870" style="s2">hold a meeting not far from here indeed</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.230" end="00:06:22.030" style="s2">a lab over in Beckwith Township was our</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.870" end="00:06:25.900" style="s2">first meeting of the lanark land owners</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.030" end="00:06:29.230" style="s2">association we went around the area we</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.900" end="00:06:32.710" style="s2">put up posters on hydro poles and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.230" end="00:06:35.560" style="s2">telephone poles we put posters up in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.710" end="00:06:40.360" style="s2">general stores and the stores around the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.560" end="00:06:44.950" style="s2">area and and we also sent a few letters</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.360" end="00:06:50.050" style="s2">to the newspapers indicating what our</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.950" end="00:06:52.320" style="s2">concerns were and we wanted to see you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.050" end="00:06:56.020" style="s2">know because we really had no idea if</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.320" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">there was anybody else who thought like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.020" end="00:06:59.620" style="s2">we did we knew there was a four of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:04.270" style="s2">but we didn&#39;t know if there was any</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.620" end="00:07:08.500" style="s2">others so we held this meeting decided</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.270" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">to give it a go and surprisingly the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.500" end="00:07:15.730" style="s2">hall was packed index Township that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:20.890" style="s2">night and people came they shared their</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.730" end="00:07:24.670" style="s2">stories they shared that they had</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.890" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">similar thoughts similar beliefs similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.670" end="00:07:31.150" style="s2">values and at the end of that night our</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:34.600" style="s2">association of four people became an</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.150" end="00:07:37.420" style="s2">association of dining people and within</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.600" end="00:07:40.060" style="s2">the next five years the lanark land</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.420" end="00:07:43.630" style="s2">owners would grow to include chapters</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.630" end="00:07:51.670" style="s2">membership of 15,000 people people found</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.040" end="00:07:54.880" style="s2">a vehicle to speak out through that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.670" end="00:07:56.650" style="s2">association they found a vehicle to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.880" end="00:07:59.670" style="s2">become involved and to make a difference</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.380" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">buildings we had a cattle auction on</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.350" end="00:09:26.210" style="s2">Parliament Hill</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:28.130" style="s2">we held tractor rallies and closed down</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.130" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">province we were very fortunate that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.400" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">had a great many members with the great</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">many skills and also a lot of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:46.190" style="s2">and passion for our subjects in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:48.470" style="s2">demand for greater personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.190" end="00:09:53.590" style="s2">responsibility and less government</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.470" end="00:09:56.390" style="s2">involvement in our property I learned</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.590" end="00:09:59.390" style="s2">many valuable lessons through those</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.390" end="00:10:03.340" style="s2">years many which were quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.390" end="00:10:08.060" style="s2">contradictory to the conventional wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.340" end="00:10:10.850" style="s2">the first lesson I learned is that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.060" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">have a mistaken belief that political</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.850" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">leaders are leaders it became clear to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:22.070" style="s2">me that most politicians are followers</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:25.370" style="s2">not leaders</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.070" end="00:10:29.180" style="s2">and that people must demonstrate and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.370" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">show government and politicians alike</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.180" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">that in order to change a policy change</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:40.459" style="s2">an activity or an issue</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:44.810" style="s2">politicians require a demonstration of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.459" end="00:10:48.649" style="s2">public support political parties often</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.810" end="00:10:51.529" style="s2">use polling or focus groups to determine</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.649" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">where it&#39;s safe to go and when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.529" end="00:10:58.250" style="s2">speaking about politics and government</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:11:00.290" style="s2">I&#39;m leaning more to the provincial and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.250" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">federal side of politics as well I want</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.290" end="00:11:05.060" style="s2">to make that clear municipal politics is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.160" style="s2">very much of course it&#39;s not a party</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.060" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">oriented system at municipal level and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.160" end="00:11:14.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a great many differences at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">municipal level but political parties</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.529" end="00:11:23.000" style="s2">use that those focus groups and polling</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">to try to determine where it&#39;s safe for</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.000" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">them to go but in doing so it really dig</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:35.079" style="s2">eighths in diminishes that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:38.930" style="s2">principle of representative democracy</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.079" end="00:11:41.839" style="s2">elected people and parties speaking with</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.930" end="00:11:45.170" style="s2">and knowing the pulse of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.839" end="00:11:49.339" style="s2">communities their constituents their</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.170" end="00:11:52.910" style="s2">constituency but also in helping to lead</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.339" end="00:11:57.620" style="s2">and advocate for change for the better</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.910" end="00:12:00.850" style="s2">in short democracy does not mean the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.620" end="00:12:03.889" style="s2">government it does not mean politicians</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.850" end="00:12:07.279" style="s2">although they are both necessary</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.889" end="00:12:13.730" style="s2">ingredients representative democracy</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">means you and me it means us</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.730" end="00:12:21.259" style="s2">that&#39;s what representative democracy</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:25.189" style="s2">must have for it to function properly it</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.259" end="00:12:29.000" style="s2">does not include the words they or them</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.189" end="00:12:32.350" style="s2">it is you and I for a representative</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.000" end="00:12:35.889" style="s2">democracy to work</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.350" end="00:12:38.439" style="s2">another lesson and I often often during</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.889" end="00:12:41.049" style="s2">those days with the landowners I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.439" end="00:12:43.559" style="s2">be approached by people people would</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.049" end="00:12:46.179" style="s2">come up to me in many venues and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.559" end="00:12:49.239" style="s2">invariably they would say something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.179" end="00:12:52.989" style="s2">long this line someone ought to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.239" end="00:12:55.569" style="s2">something about this always they would</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.989" end="00:13:00.910" style="s2">come up to me say someone ought to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.569" end="00:13:03.160" style="s2">something and that went on for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.910" end="00:13:05.439" style="s2">period of time it took me a little while</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:09.970" style="s2">to catch on that when they were seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.439" end="00:13:15.899" style="s2">someone they meant me or when they said</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.970" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">someone it meant not them right and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.899" end="00:13:23.109" style="s2">I did learn that you know I&#39;d listen to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:25.419" style="s2">their suggestion and their idea and when</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.109" end="00:13:28.569" style="s2">they told me then someone ought to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.419" end="00:13:31.779" style="s2">something I would agree with them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.569" end="00:13:34.809" style="s2">say someone ought to and I know where</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.779" end="00:13:39.160" style="s2">you can find that someone and they would</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.809" end="00:13:43.119" style="s2">look at me with a questioning look and</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.160" end="00:13:46.119" style="s2">say well who and I would say look in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.119" end="00:13:47.649" style="s2">mirror and you will find that varying</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.119" end="00:13:51.129" style="s2">someone that you&#39;re looking for and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.649" end="00:13:54.009" style="s2">until you do look in the mirror you will</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.129" end="00:14:00.999" style="s2">never find that someone who ought to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.009" end="00:14:05.889" style="s2">something and that was a it actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.999" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">worked it actually got people it</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.889" end="00:14:12.069" style="s2">motivated people to actually think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:13.480" style="s2">what they were saying and think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.069" end="00:14:19.089" style="s2">what they were doing and what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.480" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">wanted to do I could go on and on about</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.089" end="00:14:29.619" style="s2">the lessons that I learned the rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:33.729" style="s2">actions and activities and the successes</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.619" end="00:14:36.189" style="s2">that we enjoyed with the landowners but</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.729" end="00:14:39.329" style="s2">tonight I know that it is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.189" end="00:14:43.029" style="s2">has a far broader far deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.329" end="00:14:45.420" style="s2">understanding in understanding of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.510" end="00:15:04.260" style="s2">to become influential tonight we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.050" end="00:15:06.750" style="s2">honored to have that individual here</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.260" end="00:15:09.050" style="s2">tonight he is a professor of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.750" end="00:15:12.930" style="s2">at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.050" end="00:15:16.280" style="s2">he is a clinical psychologist he is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.930" end="00:15:19.890" style="s2">bringing knowledge and insight of</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.830" end="00:15:30.770" style="s2">free University lectures and I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:35.700" style="s2">you I&#39;m not one to generally watch</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.700" end="00:15:46.380" style="s2">on psychology but I started watching his</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.520" end="00:15:49.860" style="s2">lectures on maps of meaning and I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.380" end="00:15:52.220" style="s2">astonished you know the first one was</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.860" end="00:15:55.320" style="s2">like two and a half hours in length and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.220" end="00:15:57.780" style="s2">I watched the first five of them and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.320" end="00:16:02.430" style="s2">think it was the first five of them was</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.780" end="00:16:04.200" style="s2">a part of it you know these have over 10</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.430" end="00:16:06.870" style="s2">hours I&#39;m not going to get into all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.200" end="00:16:09.840" style="s2">details over ten hours but these</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.870" end="00:16:16.230" style="s2">lectures was 10 hours of breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.840" end="00:16:20.370" style="s2">and dissecting and understanding a story</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.230" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">the story of Pinocchio now I found that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.370" end="00:16:24.200" style="s2">amazing that I that I could watch these</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.640" end="00:16:40.080" style="s2">interesting to me as a kid Val ah and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.080" end="00:16:44.690" style="s2">certainly would have taken me 10 hours</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.080" end="00:16:48.300" style="s2">to describe this story to anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.690" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">but anyway yeah so that&#39;s just inside if</p>

<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:39.530" style="s2">about tonight for a very long time but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.650" end="00:18:42.830" style="s2">I really only got the title for this</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.530" end="00:18:46.280" style="s2">talk firmly in place about half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.830" end="00:18:47.570" style="s2">ago and and one of the things I like to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.280" end="00:18:49.820" style="s2">do when I&#39;m speaking to people is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.570" end="00:18:51.110" style="s2">tell them what I&#39;m thinking about not</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.820" end="00:18:53.000" style="s2">what I&#39;ve already thought about you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.110" end="00:18:54.260" style="s2">and certainly not what I know but what</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.000" end="00:18:57.620" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.260" end="00:18:59.330" style="s2">figure out and so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.620" end="00:19:00.980" style="s2">that&#39;s happened to me over the last year</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.330" end="00:19:02.990" style="s2">somewhat surprisingly is that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.980" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">invited to speak in front of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.990" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">conservative groups and a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:11.390" style="s2">were conservative groups that were</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:13.060" style="s2">composed of young people and that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.390" end="00:19:16.970" style="s2">interesting you know because</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.060" end="00:19:18.710" style="s2">conservatism isn&#39;t something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.970" end="00:19:21.320" style="s2">necessarily all that easy to sell to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.710" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">young people because they tend not to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.320" end="00:19:25.820" style="s2">that conservative to begin with and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:27.470" style="s2">conservatism also tends to have quite a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.820" end="00:19:29.030" style="s2">lot to do with things that you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.470" end="00:19:30.620" style="s2">do instead of things that you might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.030" end="00:19:32.360" style="s2">allowed to do and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.620" end="00:19:34.070" style="s2">restrictive element of it that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.360" end="00:19:36.440" style="s2">perhaps less attractive to young people</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.070" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">than it might be people do tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.440" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">more conservative as they get older as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:43.970" style="s2">personality shift and so but what I saw</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:46.040" style="s2">was very interesting because I saw and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.970" end="00:19:49.010" style="s2">this was particularly true of young men</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.040" end="00:19:51.470" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t quite puzzled that out yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.010" end="00:19:53.960" style="s2">but you know I would talk about what was</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.470" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">going on in the universities and what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.960" end="00:19:58.970" style="s2">thought might constitute a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:20:00.410" style="s2">antidote to that and that was not only</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.970" end="00:20:04.010" style="s2">in the universities but also politically</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.410" end="00:20:06.560" style="s2">but and that was both the adoption of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.010" end="00:20:08.570" style="s2">responsibility instead of the incredible</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.560" end="00:20:12.020" style="s2">and constant stress that&#39;s being placed</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.570" end="00:20:13.970" style="s2">on rights and also the responsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.020" end="00:20:15.800" style="s2">the citizen to speak for</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.970" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">we&#39;re what he or she believed to be true</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.800" end="00:20:21.380" style="s2">or at least to not speak what they knew</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:23.990" style="s2">to be false which is at least a good</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.380" end="00:20:25.550" style="s2">place to start and one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.990" end="00:20:27.260" style="s2">found so remarkable was that this was</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.550" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">actually a saleable message to young</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.260" end="00:20:31.940" style="s2">people and that surprised me because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:33.830" style="s2">know you wouldn&#39;t necessarily think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.940" end="00:20:35.210" style="s2">you would turn a lot of lights on in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.830" end="00:20:37.790" style="s2">young audience by talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.210" end="00:20:40.760" style="s2">about truth and responsibility I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.790" end="00:20:42.500" style="s2">if you if you went to a marketing agency</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.760" end="00:20:44.090" style="s2">and told them that that was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.500" end="00:20:45.740" style="s2">your political message to young people</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.090" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">they would tell you to go back and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.740" end="00:20:49.310" style="s2">know flesh out another plan sketch out</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:51.590" style="s2">another plan</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.310" end="00:20:53.870" style="s2">but maybe young people have been talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.590" end="00:20:56.030" style="s2">to enough about rights for maybe about</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.870" end="00:20:58.130" style="s2">the next 15 decades that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.030" end="00:21:00.800" style="s2">think and so maybe there&#39;s a hunger</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.130" end="00:21:02.440" style="s2">arising among young people for something</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.800" end="00:21:04.520" style="s2">that has a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.440" end="00:21:07.160" style="s2">respectability let&#39;s say a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.520" end="00:21:11.630" style="s2">more depth than the constant emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.160" end="00:21:13.880" style="s2">on doing whatever you want whenever you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.630" end="00:21:15.110" style="s2">want let&#39;s let&#39;s put it that way the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.880" end="00:21:16.730" style="s2">thing about that in the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.110" end="00:21:18.770" style="s2">rights in general that the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.730" end="00:21:21.170" style="s2">rights is that rights don&#39;t really give</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.770" end="00:21:23.090" style="s2">you much direction right they they tell</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.170" end="00:21:24.380" style="s2">you what you are in principle allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.090" end="00:21:26.180" style="s2">do but they don&#39;t really tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.380" end="00:21:27.560" style="s2">you should do and it actually turns out</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.180" end="00:21:28.820" style="s2">that you need to know what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.560" end="00:21:30.920" style="s2">because you need to do something right</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.820" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">people are active and our lives don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.920" end="00:21:34.910" style="s2">have any meaning without something to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:36.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s something that you should do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.910" end="00:21:38.450" style="s2">can&#39;t just be something that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.380" end="00:21:40.160" style="s2">do that&#39;s too shallow there&#39;s no deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.450" end="00:21:41.990" style="s2">meaning there&#39;s no enduring there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.160" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">sustaining meaning in that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.990" end="00:21:46.220" style="s2">impulsiveness and and maybe that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.770" style="s2">in some sense maybe that&#39;s entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.220" end="00:21:50.360" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s impulsively</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.770" end="00:21:52.430" style="s2">exciting and fun and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.360" end="00:21:55.310" style="s2">there&#39;s some utility in that for life</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.430" end="00:21:57.140" style="s2">but life is a very difficult journey</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.310" end="00:22:00.170" style="s2">let&#39;s say it involves a lot of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.140" end="00:22:02.270" style="s2">and it involves a lot of heavy</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.170" end="00:22:04.700" style="s2">existential weight and you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.270" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">able to put something a value up against</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.700" end="00:22:09.470" style="s2">that so that you can withstand your life</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:10.850" style="s2">and you can stand up with some dignity</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.470" end="00:22:12.200" style="s2">and you can contribute to your community</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.850" end="00:22:14.810" style="s2">and you can feel that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.200" end="00:22:16.670" style="s2">worthwhile person you know in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.810" end="00:22:18.110" style="s2">all the things that are that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.670" end="00:22:19.880" style="s2">doing wrong and in spite of all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.110" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">problems that you have and so then</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.880" end="00:22:22.820" style="s2">people need to know what they should do</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.410" style="s2">and one of the things they should do is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.820" end="00:22:25.790" style="s2">take responsibility and another thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.410" end="00:22:27.830" style="s2">they should do is try to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.790" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">because those two things hell</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.830" end="00:22:32.840" style="s2">them live proper lives and then help</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:34.909" style="s2">society organize itself properly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.840" end="00:22:37.549" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s good that&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.909" end="00:22:39.860" style="s2">everyone so and so it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.549" end="00:22:41.990" style="s2">when you tell young people that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.860" end="00:22:43.190" style="s2">pretty damn happy about that and so one</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.990" end="00:22:46.730" style="s2">of the things I thought I would do</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.190" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">tonight is talk about what conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.730" end="00:22:52.340" style="s2">might have to offer to young people as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:53.539" style="s2">saleable message you know because my the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.340" end="00:22:58.610" style="s2">other thing I&#39;ve learned over the last</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.539" end="00:23:00.529" style="s2">year this was quite revealing let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.610" end="00:23:03.080" style="s2">it that way I&#39;ll start with a briefer</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.529" end="00:23:06.289" style="s2">story just as a little intro to this in</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.080" end="00:23:07.789" style="s2">the last three weeks some of you may</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.289" end="00:23:10.429" style="s2">know that there was quite a political</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.789" end="00:23:12.200" style="s2">storm that emerged particularly among</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.429" end="00:23:14.750" style="s2">journalists over the issue of cultural</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.750" end="00:23:19.000" style="s2">got in real trouble for transgressing</p>

<p begin="00:23:26.389" end="00:23:30.440" style="s2">with that but but the thing that was so</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.850" end="00:23:32.840" style="s2">interesting and I think I probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.440" end="00:23:34.309" style="s2">talked to ten of Canada&#39;s top 20</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.840" end="00:23:35.929" style="s2">journalists but that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.309" end="00:23:38.269" style="s2">reasonable estimate most of them in</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.269" end="00:23:42.740" style="s2">one of them told me that they were</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.750" end="00:23:48.260" style="s2">like this and these people you think</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.580" end="00:23:49.549" style="s2">well if anyone has power they have power</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.260" end="00:23:51.590" style="s2">it&#39;s like well they don&#39;t really have</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.590" end="00:23:54.889" style="s2">and that&#39;s not the same thing as power</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.970" end="00:23:56.570" style="s2">and they&#39;re bloody afraid of being hung</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.889" end="00:23:58.490" style="s2">out to dry if they say the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.570" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">you think about where our damn country</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.179" end="00:24:30.919" style="s2">and a tradition that&#39;s much longer than</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.640" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">that is not good right that&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.620" end="00:24:51.650" style="s2">diagnostic sign okay well I said that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:53.630" style="s2">story was a little intro to the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.650" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">story was going to tell you and then so</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.630" end="00:25:00.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve been fortunate enough over the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:02.420" style="s2">several months to meet not the majority</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.110" end="00:25:04.250" style="s2">of the people who ran for the leadership</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:06.680" style="s2">of the federal Conservative Party but</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.250" end="00:25:10.300" style="s2">most of them including the people the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.680" end="00:25:12.740" style="s2">person who Andrew who recently won and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.300" end="00:25:14.690" style="s2">they all told me the same thing which</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.740" end="00:25:16.040" style="s2">was also interesting was that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.690" end="00:25:17.750" style="s2">Conservatives were afraid to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.040" end="00:25:19.610" style="s2">conservative and for exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.750" end="00:25:23.150" style="s2">reason they were afraid that if they put</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.610" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">forward valid conservative perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.150" end="00:25:29.780" style="s2">that they would be isolated and mobbed</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:31.970" style="s2">and taken down and and that made them</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.780" end="00:25:34.100" style="s2">censor themselves and not be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.970" end="00:25:35.810" style="s2">speak up and I thought and I told each</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.100" end="00:25:37.730" style="s2">of them when we discussed this the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.810" end="00:25:39.740" style="s2">thing was if you guys are afraid to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.730" end="00:25:42.950" style="s2">you&#39;ve already lost you might as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.740" end="00:25:46.210" style="s2">just pack up and go home it&#39;s done now</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.950" end="00:25:49.290" style="s2">you know as a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.210" end="00:25:52.390" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.290" end="00:25:54.040" style="s2">so I got to say I&#39;m not making a case</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.390" end="00:25:56.530" style="s2">for conservatism I&#39;m not here to make a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.040" end="00:25:58.780" style="s2">political case right I&#39;m here to make a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.530" end="00:26:00.220" style="s2">philosophical and psychological case and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.780" end="00:26:02.350" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing all</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.220" end="00:26:03.700" style="s2">along it has political implications so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.350" end="00:26:05.320" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that you should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.700" end="00:26:06.940" style="s2">conservative or that conservative is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.320" end="00:26:08.860" style="s2">only way to be because I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.940" end="00:26:12.179" style="s2">believe that for a variety of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.860" end="00:26:14.710" style="s2">one of the reasons is that I know that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.179" end="00:26:16.900" style="s2">political belief is determined in large</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.710" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">part by temperament and personality and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.900" end="00:26:20.170" style="s2">that&#39;s very strongly biologically</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.490" end="00:26:22.450" style="s2">influenced and so conservatives tend to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.170" end="00:26:24.610" style="s2">be lower in openness which is a trait</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.450" end="00:26:26.110" style="s2">associated with creativity and higher in</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.610" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">conscientiousness which is a trait</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.110" end="00:26:29.470" style="s2">associated with industriousness and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:31.690" style="s2">orderliness they tend to make good</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.470" end="00:26:32.890" style="s2">managers and administrators and lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.690" end="00:26:35.530" style="s2">they tend to make good conservative</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.890" end="00:26:37.420" style="s2">business types that&#39;s that&#39;s their forte</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.530" end="00:26:40.210" style="s2">that&#39;s their niche and that&#39;s a valid</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.420" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">place to be in a valid thing to be and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.210" end="00:26:43.750" style="s2">you know conservatives aren&#39;t so good at</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:44.980" style="s2">being entrepreneurial and they&#39;re not so</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.750" end="00:26:47.140" style="s2">good at being artistic and creative</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.980" end="00:26:48.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not their niche that&#39;s more the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.140" end="00:26:50.679" style="s2">niche of the liberal end of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.760" end="00:26:52.090" style="s2">and as far as I&#39;m concerned for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.679" end="00:26:54.730" style="s2">political system to function properly</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.090" end="00:26:56.500" style="s2">you need proper representation for all</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.730" end="00:26:59.080" style="s2">the temperamental types and they need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.500" end="00:27:00.670" style="s2">be engaged in dialogue so but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.080" end="00:27:02.800" style="s2">is is that when the conservatives are</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.670" end="00:27:04.900" style="s2">saying well you know especially when</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.800" end="00:27:07.480" style="s2">they&#39;re perhaps thinking about leading</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.900" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">the damn party let&#39;s say that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.480" end="00:27:12.550" style="s2">worried about speaking their mind in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:14.050" style="s2">conservative manner that&#39;s just not a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.550" end="00:27:15.700" style="s2">good thing that means that something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.050" end="00:27:17.530" style="s2">gone wrong with our political system and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.700" end="00:27:18.910" style="s2">seriously wrong you know when the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.530" end="00:27:22.140" style="s2">thing that another thing that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.910" end="00:27:24.460" style="s2">noticed it thing you know when this off</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.140" end="00:27:25.990" style="s2">some of you may know and some of you may</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.460" end="00:27:29.890" style="s2">not know that I made a couple of videos</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.990" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">back September 27th I woke up one night</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.890" end="00:27:33.670" style="s2">because I couldn&#39;t sleep and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:34.870" style="s2">are usually going right if I can&#39;t sleep</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.670" end="00:27:36.309" style="s2">because I&#39;ve got something to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.870" end="00:27:37.840" style="s2">and but I&#39;ve been playing with YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.309" end="00:27:40.630" style="s2">videos I&#39;ve been putting my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.840" end="00:27:42.280" style="s2">online since 2013 and by last April they</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.630" end="00:27:44.380" style="s2">had about a million views and so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.280" end="00:27:46.630" style="s2">thought wow that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.380" end="00:27:48.460" style="s2">something man you know like you write a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.630" end="00:27:50.980" style="s2">book you sell a million copies you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.460" end="00:27:53.020" style="s2">one happy character and I thought I a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.980" end="00:27:55.090" style="s2">million views is a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.020" end="00:27:56.170" style="s2">views it really tuned me into the fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.090" end="00:27:57.640" style="s2">that YouTube was something completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.170" end="00:28:01.240" style="s2">other than what I thought it was but</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.640" end="00:28:02.260" style="s2">anyways that night I thought oh I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.240" end="00:28:04.420" style="s2">up and make a video and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.260" end="00:28:06.400" style="s2">that of writing it down and this was a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.420" end="00:28:09.550" style="s2">video about Bill c16 which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.400" end="00:28:11.800" style="s2">the Senate just passed right half the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.550" end="00:28:13.480" style="s2">conservatives voted for it despite the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.800" end="00:28:15.670" style="s2">fact that the Justice Minister was</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.480" end="00:28:17.740" style="s2">presented with an amendment that clearly</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.670" end="00:28:20.500" style="s2">indicated that bill c16 would not</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.740" end="00:28:23.560" style="s2">infringe upon free speech and refused to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.500" end="00:28:24.100" style="s2">consider the amendment so that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.560" end="00:28:25.750" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.100" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">there&#39;s compelled speech is now the law</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.750" end="00:28:29.590" style="s2">in Canada isn&#39;t yet but it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.750" style="s2">very soon and half the Conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.590" end="00:28:33.280" style="s2">voted for that damn bill and I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.750" end="00:28:35.590" style="s2">you two you know people have gone after</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.280" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">me for being you know anti-transgender</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.590" end="00:28:40.000" style="s2">and bigoted and phobic and all that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:42.130" style="s2">nonsense that the left tends to hurl at</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.000" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">people it&#39;s not the case I read that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.130" end="00:28:46.750" style="s2">damn legislation and I read the policies</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:48.760" style="s2">surrounding it and I know perfectly well</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.750" end="00:28:50.650" style="s2">that the way it&#39;s formulated right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.760" end="00:28:52.630" style="s2">it will do more harm to the people it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.650" end="00:28:54.700" style="s2">purports to protect than good that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.630" end="00:28:58.840" style="s2">take about 10 years to unfold but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.700" end="00:29:00.610" style="s2">so incoherent and that the principles</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.840" end="00:29:02.740" style="s2">upon which that legislation and its</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.610" end="00:29:05.020" style="s2">surrounding policies are based are so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.740" end="00:29:07.060" style="s2">paradoxical and contradictory that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.020" end="00:29:08.680" style="s2">will act themselves out because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.060" end="00:29:10.720" style="s2">what happens with paradoxical beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.680" end="00:29:14.860" style="s2">and tangle people up like them in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.720" end="00:29:16.870" style="s2">like tangle people up in them like mad</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.860" end="00:29:18.550" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see that happen over the next</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.870" end="00:29:20.800" style="s2">decade and it&#39;s partly because the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.550" end="00:29:23.140" style="s2">people who put bill six c16 forward</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.800" end="00:29:24.730" style="s2">especially with regards to its</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.730" end="00:29:28.630" style="s2">detailed out on the Ontario Human Rights</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.630" end="00:29:31.990" style="s2">about transgendered people as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.370" end="00:29:34.510" style="s2">concerned there there&#39;s another agenda</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.990" end="00:29:36.160" style="s2">at work that&#39;s driving their entire</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.510" end="00:29:38.050" style="s2">political force forward and the</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.050" end="00:29:42.010" style="s2">the month right they were poster boys</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.700" end="00:29:43.900" style="s2">for moving this postmodern agenda</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.010" end="00:29:45.400" style="s2">forward and so the fact that the</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.400" end="00:29:49.660" style="s2">good do the transgendered people any</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.660" end="00:29:56.490" style="s2">put the legislation forward so anyways I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.170" end="00:29:58.900" style="s2">made these videos and I put them on on</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.490" end="00:30:00.600" style="s2">YouTube and well to say they caused the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.900" end="00:30:02.740" style="s2">storm which is somewhat of an</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.600" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">understatement I mean it&#39;s just been I</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.740" end="00:30:07.330" style="s2">just I I don&#39;t even know what to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:10.840" style="s2">about it&#39;s completely and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.330" end="00:30:12.430" style="s2">surreal what&#39;s happened to me I as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.840" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">consequence of that I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.430" end="00:30:16.150" style="s2">how many people have watched those</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:19.060" style="s2">original videos like 350,000 and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.150" end="00:30:21.280" style="s2">think now about 50 million people have</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.060" end="00:30:22.750" style="s2">watched videos associated with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.280" end="00:30:24.970" style="s2">sequence of events that I&#39;m describing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.750" end="00:30:28.210" style="s2">which is just three hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.970" end="00:30:29.920" style="s2">thousand people watched the testimony</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.210" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">that I gave before the Senate on Bill</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.920" end="00:30:34.270" style="s2">c16 you bloody well know that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:35.830" style="s2">apocalypse is closed when three hundred</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.830" end="00:30:41.470" style="s2">world watch a Canadian Senate hearing</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.260" end="00:30:50.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like really bad really what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.470" end="00:30:51.790" style="s2">on man so anyways you know so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.260" end="00:30:55.210" style="s2">said well the journalists are nervous</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.790" end="00:30:58.360" style="s2">and that and and the Conservatives are</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.210" end="00:31:01.030" style="s2">nervous and and well then you know when</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.360" end="00:31:03.040" style="s2">I when I put myself out and made these</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.030" end="00:31:04.330" style="s2">videos which I really didn&#39;t expect to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.040" end="00:31:05.950" style="s2">attract much attention at all I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.330" end="00:31:07.270" style="s2">assumed that I was going to clarify what</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.950" end="00:31:08.770" style="s2">I was thinking a little bit and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.270" end="00:31:11.110" style="s2">and see what happened I kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.770" end="00:31:14.080" style="s2">curious person now that&#39;ll teach me but</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.110" end="00:31:16.420" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of a curious person and so um</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:17.830" style="s2">but then you know I also experienced</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.420" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">firsthand what happens when you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.830" end="00:31:22.180" style="s2">something like that now what I got</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:24.010" style="s2">nailed right I got especially for about</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.180" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">three months things were pretty up in</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.010" end="00:31:27.550" style="s2">the air at the University sent me two</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:29.380" style="s2">letters telling me that it ha it was so</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.550" end="00:31:30.970" style="s2">funny because I read made this video and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.380" end="00:31:32.710" style="s2">I said you know under this new</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.970" end="00:31:35.350" style="s2">legislation making this video</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.710" end="00:31:37.270" style="s2">criticizing this legislation is probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.350" end="00:31:39.730" style="s2">illegal and so then the independent</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.270" end="00:31:41.650" style="s2">people of course reacted to me as if I</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.730" end="00:31:43.420" style="s2">was scare mongering which by the way was</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.650" end="00:31:45.490" style="s2">the right response when you hear someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.420" end="00:31:47.950" style="s2">in a stable society stand up and say</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.490" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">excuse me there&#39;s a there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.950" end="00:31:51.160" style="s2">rotten at the base here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">affecting the manner in which the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.160" end="00:31:54.940" style="s2">legislation that our country is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">producing is is being rolled forth when</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.940" end="00:31:58.930" style="s2">they say that you should think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:00.400" style="s2">person is probably a charlatan and have</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.930" end="00:32:01.660" style="s2">something wrong with them we could look</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.400" end="00:32:03.100" style="s2">the culture works pretty good the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.660" end="00:32:04.900" style="s2">country&#39;s worked really well for a long</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.100" end="00:32:07.000" style="s2">period of time and so the logical</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.900" end="00:32:08.560" style="s2">initial response should be yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.000" end="00:32:09.790" style="s2">think there&#39;s a fundamental problem why</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.560" end="00:32:11.890" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we just assume that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.790" end="00:32:13.960" style="s2">fundamental problem with you and one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.890" end="00:32:15.780" style="s2">the ways that you you determine that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.960" end="00:32:17.740" style="s2">you throw things out the person</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.780" end="00:32:20.020" style="s2">metaphorically and see if any of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.740" end="00:32:22.600" style="s2">stick right so you know I was a bigot</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.020" end="00:32:24.070" style="s2">and a homophobe and a transphobic and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.600" end="00:32:25.570" style="s2">racist that one I don&#39;t know where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.070" end="00:32:29.230" style="s2">hell that one came from I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.570" end="00:32:29.980" style="s2">because I sized the two what would you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.230" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">call red</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.980" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">prehensile women who started black lives</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:35.770" style="s2">the black lives matter movement Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:37.540" style="s2">it isn&#39;t because they&#39;re black it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.770" end="00:32:39.730" style="s2">because they&#39;re reprehensible black or</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.540" end="00:32:41.320" style="s2">white man if you&#39;re reprehensible you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.730" end="00:32:46.350" style="s2">reprehensible that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.320" end="00:32:46.350" style="s2">definition of not being racist right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.780" end="00:32:57.880" style="s2">anyways so so so there were a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.020" end="00:32:59.799" style="s2">demonstrations and then the press jumped</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.880" end="00:33:02.260" style="s2">on me to some degree they didn&#39;t do too</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.799" end="00:33:03.700" style="s2">bad a job I didn&#39;t think and then the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.260" end="00:33:05.350" style="s2">university thankfully wrote two letters</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.700" end="00:33:07.570" style="s2">saying that what I was doing was</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.350" end="00:33:09.669" style="s2">probably illegal and that it violated</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.570" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">the the Ontario Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.669" end="00:33:13.540" style="s2">Commission&#39;s policies and probably the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.679" end="00:33:14.650" style="s2">university&#39;s policies as well as as far</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.540" end="00:33:16.600" style="s2">as they were concerned which really</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.650" end="00:33:18.250" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the case and the letters also</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.600" end="00:33:20.380" style="s2">contained a number of untruths which I</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.250" end="00:33:22.330" style="s2">detailed because I read them on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.380" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">too which is what actually quite helpful</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.330" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">and handy that you know if someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.660" end="00:33:30.010" style="s2">writes me a letter that purports to lay</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.570" style="s2">out a set of facts then I can just read</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.010" end="00:33:32.950" style="s2">it I don&#39;t even have to comment on it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.570" end="00:33:37.210" style="s2">can read it and let people make up their</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.950" end="00:33:40.929" style="s2">own minds which they did so so well and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.210" end="00:33:42.490" style="s2">so my job was in doubt in doubt but the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.929" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">fact that the university went after me</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.490" end="00:33:45.990" style="s2">actually turned out to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:48.010" style="s2">helpful right because I had said look</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.990" end="00:33:49.929" style="s2">under the provisions of this new</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.010" end="00:33:52.210" style="s2">legislation and legislation like this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.929" end="00:33:54.220" style="s2">that&#39;s already in place in Canada what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.210" end="00:33:56.140" style="s2">am doing criticizing this bill is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.220" end="00:33:57.880" style="s2">probably illegal and everyone said no</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.140" end="00:33:59.140" style="s2">you&#39;re crazy you know you&#39;re there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.880" end="00:34:01.240" style="s2">something wrong with you you&#39;re a you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.140" end="00:34:03.040" style="s2">a you&#39;re a scare monger and a rabble</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.240" end="00:34:04.780" style="s2">rouser and all of that and then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.040" end="00:34:07.870" style="s2">university wrote letters saying what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.780" end="00:34:09.790" style="s2">did violated you know the university</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.870" end="00:34:11.409" style="s2">policy and probably the Ontario Human</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.790" end="00:34:13.210" style="s2">Rights Commission&#39;s policies and the law</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.409" end="00:34:15.340" style="s2">and I thought great you had your lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.210" end="00:34:17.260" style="s2">take a look at it I couldn&#39;t ask for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.340" end="00:34:19.690" style="s2">more stronger statement a stronger</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.260" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">statement in support of what I had said</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.690" end="00:34:23.470" style="s2">especially because it certainly wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:24.850" style="s2">written in support of what I had said so</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.470" end="00:34:26.889" style="s2">and then the journalist started to pay</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.850" end="00:34:28.330" style="s2">attention to what I had actually looked</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.889" end="00:34:30.129" style="s2">at and they read it and they thought oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.330" end="00:34:31.840" style="s2">hey look at that that aren&#39;t that our</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.129" end="00:34:34.090" style="s2">entire human rights commission website</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.840" end="00:34:36.970" style="s2">policy mass is actually quite a nest of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.090" end="00:34:38.379" style="s2">spiders just like he said and so it</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.970" end="00:34:40.060" style="s2">turns out that there is something rotten</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.379" end="00:34:41.950" style="s2">in the state of Denmark and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.060" end="00:34:43.990" style="s2">not so good and so like this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.950" end="00:34:45.700" style="s2">country man that&#39;s why people want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.990" end="00:34:48.339" style="s2">here it&#39;s one of the best countries in</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.700" end="00:34:49.510" style="s2">the world maybe it&#39;s the best country in</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.339" end="00:34:51.310" style="s2">the world I mean we don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.510" end="00:34:53.379" style="s2">too high on our horse about that and God</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.310" end="00:34:55.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t we fortunate but it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.379" end="00:34:58.089" style="s2">good place you know but it&#39;s not what it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.960" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">used to be and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.089" end="00:35:02.619" style="s2">running it are not who you think they</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.920" end="00:35:06.070" style="s2">are so for example provincially let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.619" end="00:35:08.859" style="s2">take it the title that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.070" end="00:35:11.619" style="s2">follow Kathleen Wynne have is liberal</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.859" end="00:35:13.450" style="s2">they are not liberals they are radicals</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.619" end="00:35:15.070" style="s2">and they&#39;re radicals of a sort I used to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.450" end="00:35:17.670" style="s2">work for the NDP when I was a kid back</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.070" end="00:35:19.510" style="s2">in the 70s and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.670" end="00:35:21.010" style="s2">influential in Kathleen Wynne&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.510" end="00:35:22.420" style="s2">government and who are making the sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.010" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">of policies that I regard is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.420" end="00:35:26.940" style="s2">particularly reprehensible are the kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.460" end="00:35:29.650" style="s2">of radical leftists that the NDP</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.930" end="00:36:37.390" style="s2">look up like ten Women&#39;s Studies</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:38.619" style="s2">programs and read what they say you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.390" end="00:36:41.290" style="s2">don&#39;t have to listen to me you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.970" end="00:36:47.109" style="s2">and there the activism is devoted to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:48.510" style="s2">certain key set of ends and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.109" end="00:36:50.619" style="s2">for example here&#39;s a word to remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.510" end="00:36:52.780" style="s2">equity okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.619" end="00:36:54.550" style="s2">that&#39;s replaced equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.780" end="00:36:56.859" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.550" end="00:36:57.829" style="s2">that&#39;s a tough one to bring about you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.859" end="00:36:59.180" style="s2">know you need a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.829" end="00:37:00.799" style="s2">a bit of government intervention to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.180" end="00:37:02.839" style="s2">bring about equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.799" end="00:37:06.109" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a noble goal it&#39;s a tough one</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.839" end="00:37:07.910" style="s2">to attain but equity equity means</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.109" end="00:37:10.009" style="s2">equality of outcome and you see an</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.910" end="00:37:13.039" style="s2">equity everywhere and that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.009" end="00:37:16.069" style="s2">means and so the people who are pushing</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.039" end="00:37:19.479" style="s2">this radical agenda are pushing things</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.069" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">that are that are inimitable to our</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.479" end="00:37:24.619" style="s2">traditions and and practices of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:26.989" style="s2">governance you know the ontario social</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.619" end="00:37:29.299" style="s2">justice tribunals because we have social</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.989" end="00:37:31.459" style="s2">justice tribunals in ontario they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.299" end="00:37:34.459" style="s2">even deign now to hide the damn name the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.459" end="00:37:37.099" style="s2">social justice tribunals are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.459" end="00:37:39.289" style="s2">suspend standard jurisprudential</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.099" end="00:37:41.779" style="s2">practice in the pursuit of their aims it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.289" end="00:37:44.180" style="s2">says that right in their policies well</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.779" end="00:37:46.099" style="s2">you think about that really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.180" end="00:37:48.469" style="s2">written in your policies you can just</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.099" end="00:37:50.089" style="s2">dispense with classic jurisprudential</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.469" end="00:37:51.559" style="s2">tradition so what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.089" end="00:37:54.440" style="s2">it means you can do any damn thing you</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.559" end="00:37:57.019" style="s2">want and so those are the sorts of I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.440" end="00:37:58.999" style="s2">would say subversive and fifth column</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.019" end="00:38:01.369" style="s2">like organizations that are sprouting up</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.999" end="00:38:04.759" style="s2">in our society everywhere it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.369" end="00:38:06.109" style="s2">good thing and so look when someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.759" end="00:38:08.239" style="s2">stands up and says there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.109" end="00:38:10.940" style="s2">wrong the first thing you should ask is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.239" end="00:38:12.170" style="s2">what makes why should I assume that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.940" end="00:38:17.719" style="s2">know what the hell you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.170" end="00:38:19.339" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question well you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.719" end="00:38:20.690" style="s2">investigate it and you find out whether</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.339" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">or not the person does know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.690" end="00:38:24.859" style="s2">talking about and on the issue that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:26.900" style="s2">describing to you tonight as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.859" end="00:38:29.150" style="s2">can tell I know what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.900" end="00:38:31.789" style="s2">now people have been on my case about</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.150" end="00:38:34.039" style="s2">this in a very serious way for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.789" end="00:38:36.289" style="s2">long time and so far they haven&#39;t made</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.039" end="00:38:38.269" style="s2">any inroads into my arguments and most</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.289" end="00:38:39.769" style="s2">of the time they&#39;re too damn cowardly to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.269" end="00:38:41.449" style="s2">debate me which is also something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.769" end="00:38:43.759" style="s2">really interesting because I put out</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.449" end="00:38:45.739" style="s2">public calls constantly if you you want</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.759" end="00:38:47.660" style="s2">to debate about gender and sex you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.739" end="00:38:49.759" style="s2">bring it on because that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.660" end="00:38:52.069" style="s2">happens to be an area of expertise for</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.759" end="00:38:54.349" style="s2">me and I know the damn literature if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.069" end="00:38:55.999" style="s2">want to come out and make your case that</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.349" end="00:38:57.910" style="s2">all the differences between men and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.999" end="00:39:00.259" style="s2">women are socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.910" end="00:39:02.299" style="s2">culturally constructed or that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.259" end="00:39:04.459" style="s2">just or that they&#39;re just a personal</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.299" end="00:39:05.779" style="s2">whim which by the way is exactly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.459" end="00:39:07.999" style="s2">written into the policies surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.779" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">Bill c16 then you come out make that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.999" end="00:39:11.269" style="s2">case publicly and see how well it stands</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:13.039" style="s2">up and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.269" end="00:39:14.959" style="s2">know how well it will stand up because</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.039" end="00:39:17.899" style="s2">that kind of thinking was defeated in</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.959" end="00:39:20.119" style="s2">the scientific realm back in the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.899" end="00:39:23.029" style="s2">in the universities and what that meant</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.119" end="00:39:24.619" style="s2">was that the radicals who wanted to keep</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.619" end="00:39:28.999" style="s2">just circumvented the entire scientific</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.609" end="00:39:45.319" style="s2">now what they do instead is criticize</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.630" end="00:41:26.790" style="s2">couple of months ago I did this lecture</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.940" end="00:41:28.350" style="s2">and Vancouver called a left-wing case</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.790" end="00:41:30.150" style="s2">for free speech because you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.350" end="00:41:32.820" style="s2">make a left-wing case for free speech</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.150" end="00:41:34.590" style="s2">pretty easily right it&#39;s like obviously</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.820" end="00:41:36.450" style="s2">some people have more influence and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.590" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2">authority than others and just as</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.450" end="00:41:39.810" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s harder for the people</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:41.790" style="s2">with less influence and authority to</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.810" end="00:41:43.740" style="s2">make their case known so clearly they</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.790" end="00:41:45.300" style="s2">need to be able to make their case so</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.740" end="00:41:47.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the left-wing case for free</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.300" end="00:41:49.830" style="s2">speech fairly straightforward I thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.820" end="00:41:51.540" style="s2">it needed to be made because especially</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.830" end="00:41:53.550" style="s2">on the radical left people seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.540" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">forgotten that free speech was actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.550" end="00:41:59.460" style="s2">their most what welcome friend and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:01.140" style="s2">enabled them to do whatever good things</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.460" end="00:42:03.390" style="s2">they did managed to do over the last</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.140" end="00:42:05.550" style="s2">hundred years but I made a left wing</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.390" end="00:42:06.900" style="s2">case and so that was easy and reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.550" end="00:42:09.120" style="s2">entertaining and you can watch that on</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.900" end="00:42:11.100" style="s2">YouTube if you want and so tonight what</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.120" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">I thought I&#39;d do as a counterpart to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.100" end="00:42:15.990" style="s2">that is lay out what I believe might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:17.910" style="s2">some tenets for a viable 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.990" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">conservatism and these are ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.910" end="00:42:21.750" style="s2">I&#39;m playing with so I&#39;m going to I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:23.010" style="s2">down about 12 of them I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.750" end="00:42:24.869" style="s2">we&#39;ll get through all of them but we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.010" end="00:42:26.910" style="s2">we can start with a few and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.869" end="00:42:29.789" style="s2">this is what the Conservatives could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.910" end="00:42:31.559" style="s2">selling to the public now what seems to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.789" end="00:42:33.809" style="s2">me to be happening instead at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.559" end="00:42:42.990" style="s2">is as Kathleen Wynne flames out not</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.809" end="00:42:44.549" style="s2">nearly fast enough in my opinion the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.990" end="00:42:46.049" style="s2">attitude among conservatives that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.549" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">provincial party seems to be something</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.049" end="00:42:49.799" style="s2">well let&#39;s just go like go let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:51.509" style="s2">cluster in a corner and not do anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.799" end="00:42:52.950" style="s2">too stupid because maybe she&#39;ll burn</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.509" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">yourself out so badly that we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.950" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">win the next election and we won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">to you know do anything that will put us</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:43:00.779" style="s2">at risk and I&#39;m not being cynical about</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.430" style="s2">that I can understand the the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.779" end="00:43:04.619" style="s2">that policy although I think it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.430" end="00:43:06.210" style="s2">policy and I think it&#39;s a bad policy</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.619" end="00:43:08.430" style="s2">because there are some things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.210" end="00:43:09.900" style="s2">seriously need to be said about Kathleen</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.430" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">Wynne in her government I could tell you</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.900" end="00:43:14.309" style="s2">one noble aim for the provincial</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:17.220" style="s2">Conservatives for the next election</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.309" end="00:43:19.859" style="s2">would be to decimate the provincial</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.220" end="00:43:21.569" style="s2">liberals not one should be left what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.859" end="00:43:25.140" style="s2">what&#39;s her popularity at right now under</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.569" end="00:43:27.749" style="s2">10% if she had a shred of integrity she</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.140" end="00:43:29.880" style="s2">would have already resigned so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.749" end="00:43:32.489" style="s2">there is a goal for the Conservatives no</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.880" end="00:43:34.650" style="s2">liberal sitting after the 2018 election</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.489" end="00:43:36.869" style="s2">that would send a message to the social</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.650" end="00:43:38.609" style="s2">justice warrior types it would also send</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.869" end="00:43:40.710" style="s2">a message to the centrists who should</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.609" end="00:43:42.329" style="s2">actually be occupying the positions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.710" end="00:43:44.220" style="s2">power in the Liberal Party that if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.329" end="00:43:45.989" style="s2">allow yourself to be taken over by a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.220" end="00:43:48.509" style="s2">radical fringe you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.989" end="00:43:50.309" style="s2">decimated at the polls so you know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.509" end="00:43:52.589" style="s2">might be an exciting message to sell</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.309" end="00:43:54.779" style="s2">young people get out there knock on some</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.589" end="00:43:57.450" style="s2">doors see if you can take the social</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.779" end="00:43:59.579" style="s2">justice warriors out at the top before</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.450" end="00:44:01.589" style="s2">before they do more damage than they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.579" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">already done she&#39;s got another year to</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.589" end="00:44:04.829" style="s2">do plenty of damage and you can be sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.289" style="s2">that she&#39;s going to do plenty more</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.829" end="00:44:08.910" style="s2">damage in that here so okay what else</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.289" end="00:44:13.109" style="s2">here&#39;s some things you might think about</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.910" end="00:44:16.710" style="s2">if you&#39;re a conservative these things</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.109" end="00:44:18.269" style="s2">have become what would you say people</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.710" end="00:44:20.700" style="s2">are afraid to say them here&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.269" end="00:44:24.239" style="s2">one the fundamental assumptions of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.700" end="00:44:28.460" style="s2">Western civilization are valid how about</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.239" end="00:44:28.460" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">you think it&#39;s an accident</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.150" end="00:44:36.410" style="s2">oh here&#39;s how you find out okay which</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:40.370" style="s2">countries do people want to move away</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.410" end="00:44:43.580" style="s2">from hey not ours which countries do</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.370" end="00:44:46.010" style="s2">people want to move to ours guess what</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.580" end="00:44:47.360" style="s2">they work better and it&#39;s not because we</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.010" end="00:44:48.680" style="s2">went around the world stealing</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.360" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">everything we could get our hands on</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.680" end="00:44:53.240" style="s2">it&#39;s because we got certain fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:55.400" style="s2">assumptions right thank God for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.240" end="00:44:57.260" style="s2">after thousands and thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.400" end="00:44:58.970" style="s2">of trying and because of that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.260" end="00:45:01.430" style="s2">managed to establish a set of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.970" end="00:45:03.920" style="s2">civilizations that are shining lights in</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.430" end="00:45:05.690" style="s2">the world you know now you can be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.920" end="00:45:07.670" style="s2">damn filthy and still be a shining light</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.690" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">in this world right because if you look</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.670" end="00:45:11.000" style="s2">around the world that&#39;s the state of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:13.910" style="s2">governance in most places it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.000" end="00:45:16.700" style="s2">most pathological corrupt and vicious</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.910" end="00:45:18.080" style="s2">thugs rule and to stand out as an</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.700" end="00:45:19.910" style="s2">illuminated light against that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.080" end="00:45:21.950" style="s2">background is it so difficult but</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.910" end="00:45:24.380" style="s2">nonetheless you know we&#39;re as good as</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.950" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">it&#39;s got and unless we can come up with</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.380" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">something better we should be very</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:28.850" style="s2">careful about messing around with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:30.230" style="s2">so why don&#39;t we start with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.850" end="00:45:31.640" style="s2">assumption that we&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.230" end="00:45:33.500" style="s2">right one of the things we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.640" end="00:45:35.990" style="s2">right for example is that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.500" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">value the individual right the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.990" end="00:45:40.280" style="s2">individual has intrinsic value in</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:42.230" style="s2">Western societies do you know how long</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.280" end="00:45:44.600" style="s2">it took people to formulate that as an</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.230" end="00:45:47.540" style="s2">idea and how unlikely that idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.600" end="00:45:50.750" style="s2">poor you you know useless powerless you</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.540" end="00:45:52.760" style="s2">with all your damn fault you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.750" end="00:45:55.220" style="s2">worth something you&#39;re worth something</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.760" end="00:45:57.740" style="s2">to the point that the law has to respect</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.220" end="00:46:00.350" style="s2">you God we don&#39;t want to abandon that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.740" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">for some half-witted collectivism which</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.350" end="00:46:03.350" style="s2">we&#39;re doing as rapidly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:06.110" style="s2">because one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.350" end="00:46:07.640" style="s2">characterizes the radical left types is</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.110" end="00:46:09.560" style="s2">they don&#39;t give a damn about you as an</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.640" end="00:46:11.810" style="s2">individual or about individuals at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.560" end="00:46:13.970" style="s2">you&#39;re black or you&#39;re white or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.810" end="00:46:16.940" style="s2">Latino or you&#39;re transsexual you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.940" end="00:46:20.840" style="s2">you&#39;re a member of a group and the only</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:23.000" style="s2">thing that matters is the group well I</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.840" end="00:46:24.920" style="s2">can tell you if the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.000" end="00:46:27.260" style="s2">matters is the group you bloody well</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.920" end="00:46:29.420" style="s2">don&#39;t matter very much and then you got</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.260" end="00:46:31.250" style="s2">to ask yourself just exactly what sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.420" end="00:46:33.980" style="s2">of people are trying to set things up so</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.250" end="00:46:36.470" style="s2">it is that the individual doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.980" end="00:46:38.270" style="s2">very much well it&#39;s the sort of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.470" end="00:46:40.220" style="s2">to whom the individual doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.270" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">very much and I might suggest that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.220" end="00:46:42.979" style="s2">don&#39;t elect them</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.930" style="s2">and that when they attempt to take power</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.979" end="00:46:51.650" style="s2">that you do everything you can to stalk</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.930" end="00:46:54.769" style="s2">them okay so that&#39;s assumption number</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.650" end="00:46:58.190" style="s2">one the assumption number two peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.769" end="00:47:02.450" style="s2">social being is preferable to isolation</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.190" end="00:47:04.249" style="s2">and to war in consequence it justly and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.450" end="00:47:06.920" style="s2">rightly demand some sacrifice of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.249" end="00:47:08.839" style="s2">individual impulse an idiosyncrasy okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.920" end="00:47:10.549" style="s2">so you want to live alone in the bush</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.839" end="00:47:12.859" style="s2">you&#39;re going to starve to death and be</p>

<p begin="00:47:12.859" end="00:47:16.849" style="s2">solution okay so you have to cooperate</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.460" end="00:54:45.710" style="s2">some hierarchies of competence out there</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.230" end="00:54:48.410" style="s2">like a thousand of them go be a plumber</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.410" end="00:54:53.480" style="s2">one be I&#39;d a plumber once you know it</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.800" end="00:54:55.010" style="s2">was the night it was the night before we</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.480" end="00:54:57.050" style="s2">were putting drywall in our house we</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.010" end="00:54:59.270" style="s2">were redoing a house and he had put in</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.050" end="00:55:00.980" style="s2">all the plastic piping you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.270" end="00:55:02.360" style="s2">was going to test the joints these are</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.980" end="00:55:04.550" style="s2">supposed to be glued together with his</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.360" end="00:55:06.500" style="s2">pipe glue right and I said I told him I</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.550" end="00:55:07.700" style="s2">had to test the joints and he said well</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.500" end="00:55:09.470" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to test my joints they</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.700" end="00:55:11.720" style="s2">never leak and I thought yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.470" end="00:55:13.610" style="s2">okay how about if I test them so I went</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.720" end="00:55:15.500" style="s2">up on the third floor and filled the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.610" end="00:55:17.090" style="s2">pipes with water capping them in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.500" end="00:55:18.770" style="s2">basement like you&#39;re supposed to it like</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.090" end="00:55:20.540" style="s2">half an hour later had two inches of</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.770" end="00:55:22.460" style="s2">water in the basement there were thirty</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.540" end="00:55:24.380" style="s2">leaking joints that was the night before</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.460" end="00:55:27.170" style="s2">the drywallers were supposed to show up</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.380" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">so well so he wasn&#39;t particularly</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.170" end="00:55:29.390" style="s2">competent</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:31.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the point of that story but even</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.390" end="00:55:34.670" style="s2">more so he had put a bunch of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.370" end="00:55:35.810" style="s2">plastic pipe outside where the drywall</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.670" end="00:55:37.460" style="s2">would be so it would have been sticking</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.810" end="00:55:39.740" style="s2">through the wall so I spent a frenetic</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.460" end="00:55:42.110" style="s2">night you know sawing through plastic</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.740" end="00:55:44.150" style="s2">pipe and reglue in joints so that my</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.110" end="00:55:46.070" style="s2">well so that the dry rollers could come</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.150" end="00:55:47.840" style="s2">in what&#39;s the point if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.070" end="00:55:49.610" style="s2">be a plumber man be a good plumber</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.840" end="00:55:51.380" style="s2">because otherwise all you do is go out</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.610" end="00:55:53.330" style="s2">there and cause trouble we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.380" end="00:55:55.790" style="s2">people to cause more trouble we need</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.330" end="00:55:57.710" style="s2">people to solve problems you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.790" end="00:55:59.030" style="s2">you can be a tradesman and you can be to</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.710" end="00:56:02.530" style="s2">make a lot of money as a trades person</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.030" end="00:56:05.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a bloody reliable honorable</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.530" end="00:56:06.680" style="s2">forthright productive way of making a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.120" end="00:56:09.020" style="s2">living and there is a hell of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.680" end="00:56:11.510" style="s2">difference between a working man who</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.020" end="00:56:13.430" style="s2">knows what he&#39;s doing and one who</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.510" end="00:56:15.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t both in terms of skill and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.430" end="00:56:17.090" style="s2">ethics right and you work with someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.470" end="00:56:18.890" style="s2">who knows what they&#39;re doing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.090" end="00:56:20.300" style="s2">bloody pleasure they tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.890" end="00:56:22.220" style="s2">they&#39;re going to do they tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.300" end="00:56:24.260" style="s2">much it will cost they go and do it it</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.220" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">works and you pay them perfect</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.260" end="00:56:27.950" style="s2">everyone&#39;s happy and that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.540" end="00:56:29.810" style="s2">when you have genuine hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.950" end="00:56:32.660" style="s2">competence and so you till you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.810" end="00:56:35.120" style="s2">these panderers of egalitarian legality</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.660" end="00:56:36.830" style="s2">egalitarianism and equity and they fail</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.120" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">to recognize completely that there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.830" end="00:56:40.460" style="s2">differences in rank between people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.080" style="s2">not such a terrible thing man</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.460" end="00:56:44.270" style="s2">maybe you wouldn&#39;t be a great lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.080" end="00:56:45.560" style="s2">like it&#39;s certainly possible most people</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.270" end="00:56:47.330" style="s2">aren&#39;t but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.560" end="00:56:49.880" style="s2">something you could be great at there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.330" end="00:56:52.760" style="s2">lots of hierarchies to attempt to climb</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.880" end="00:56:54.560" style="s2">and if you fail in one go try in another</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.760" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">but the point is you&#39;re still trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.560" end="00:56:57.980" style="s2">aim for the top and what the hell are</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:00.140" style="s2">you going to do if you don&#39;t try to aim</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.980" end="00:57:02.690" style="s2">for the top you know flap about</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.140" end="00:57:04.580" style="s2">uselessly and whine about your life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.690" end="00:57:05.300" style="s2">not helpful it&#39;ll just make you</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.590" end="00:57:23.210" style="s2">and get to the top of whatever it is</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.060" end="00:57:41.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s painful to watch</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.920" end="00:57:43.160" style="s2">they&#39;re so relieved</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.450" end="00:57:46.220" style="s2">would find someone finally comes up and</p>

<p begin="00:57:53.570" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">they think really that&#39;s possible wow</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.270" end="00:58:00.320" style="s2">that would be that would be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:03.079" style="s2">that might make life or life worth</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.320" end="00:58:04.940" style="s2">living it&#39;s like yeah it might so why</p>

<p begin="00:58:04.940" end="00:58:08.060" style="s2">universities we&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.320" end="00:58:10.280" style="s2">teaching people they&#39;ve forgotten that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.060" end="00:58:12.740" style="s2">went to Harvard months ago months and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.280" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">half used to teach there and I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.740" end="00:58:16.130" style="s2">a bunch of students you know and I told</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:18.560" style="s2">them it&#39;s not easy to get into Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.130" end="00:58:20.630" style="s2">you know like you&#39;re a valedictorian if</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.560" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">you&#39;re at Harvard and not only are you a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.630" end="00:58:25.160" style="s2">valedictorian you&#39;re way better than</p>

<p begin="00:58:29.570" end="00:58:34.550" style="s2">like 5% and believe me not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.240" end="00:58:36.349" style="s2">applies so it&#39;s a very selective school</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.550" end="00:58:39.170" style="s2">and so why am I saying now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.349" end="00:58:41.690" style="s2">these are high quality kids so I told</p>

<p begin="00:59:00.140" end="00:59:04.460" style="s2">someone would have told us that when we</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.640" end="00:59:06.859" style="s2">were in our first year it&#39;s like Jesus</p>

<p begin="00:59:38.190" end="00:59:41.970" style="s2">man it&#39;s like a psychotherapeutic</p>

<p begin="00:59:48.540" end="00:59:54.420" style="s2">they don&#39;t know so Carl Jung&#39;s advice</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.670" end="00:59:57.060" style="s2">was look at the outcome and infer the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.420" end="00:59:59.640" style="s2">motivation okay so you produce a</p>

<p begin="01:00:07.589" end="01:00:12.300" style="s2">members of an oppressed group and</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.510" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">victims it&#39;s like well why would you why</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:18.119" style="s2">answer is well that&#39;s what the people</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.260" end="01:00:20.190" style="s2">who taught them wanted to turn them into</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.119" end="01:00:22.079" style="s2">and then you might think well did they</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.190" end="01:00:24.210" style="s2">do that because they cared for them it</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.079" end="01:00:26.609" style="s2">seems bloody unlikely to me you take</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.210" end="01:00:27.690" style="s2">this great raw material right we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.609" end="01:00:29.460" style="s2">taken a lot of work to make an</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.690" end="01:00:30.930" style="s2">institution like the University of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.460" end="01:00:32.849" style="s2">Toronto or like Harvard we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.930" end="01:00:34.800" style="s2">working on that for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.849" end="01:00:37.170" style="s2">and you invite people in you thank God</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.800" end="01:00:38.430" style="s2">we selected you so carefully because we</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.170" end="01:00:40.470" style="s2">think you could be a world beater and</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.430" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">then what we do is we don&#39;t teach you</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.470" end="01:00:43.170" style="s2">how to think we don&#39;t teach you how to</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:44.790" style="s2">speak we don&#39;t get you to read great</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.170" end="01:00:46.950" style="s2">books and we convince you that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.790" end="01:00:49.230" style="s2">victim and that your culture is corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.950" end="01:00:51.089" style="s2">it&#39;s like great well those people are no</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.230" end="01:00:52.560" style="s2">friends of those institutions I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.089" end="01:00:55.380" style="s2">you that and they&#39;re even less friends</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.560" end="01:00:58.829" style="s2">of those students so hierarchies arc of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.380" end="01:01:02.480" style="s2">competence are desirable and they should</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.829" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">be promoted so none of this idiot</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.480" end="01:01:06.990" style="s2">egalitarian equity it&#39;s not good for</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:08.670" style="s2">anyone first of all it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.990" end="01:01:11.550" style="s2">second it would be murderous to impose</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.670" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">but third even if it succeeded it would</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.550" end="01:01:16.530" style="s2">fail as fast as it succeeded that would</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:18.329" style="s2">be how fast it would fail why would you</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.530" end="01:01:20.970" style="s2">strive for anything if there was no up</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.329" end="01:01:23.310" style="s2">to strive for if everything is flat and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.970" end="01:01:25.710" style="s2">equal well when you&#39;re starving or dying</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.310" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">then everyone&#39;s equal and believe me the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.710" end="01:01:31.319" style="s2">egalitarian the ie egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:33.210" style="s2">totalitarians who dominated the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.319" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">century knew perfectly well how to make</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.210" end="01:01:37.950" style="s2">people equal and they made them equal in</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:39.599" style="s2">gulag work camps and in starvation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.950" end="01:01:44.180" style="s2">I&#39;m sure we could attain that if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.599" end="01:01:56.549" style="s2">wanted to so all right next borders are</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.180" end="01:01:58.680" style="s2">reasonable how about that the law is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.549" end="01:02:04.950" style="s2">border that stops someone from stealing</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.680" end="01:02:06.960" style="s2">your laptop and if it&#39;s an Apple laptop</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.950" end="01:02:09.269" style="s2">well it&#39;s the sort of laptop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.960" end="01:02:11.759" style="s2">social justice where you would carry and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.269" end="01:02:13.289" style="s2">then the social justice warrior is going</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.759" end="01:02:15.359" style="s2">to be very irritated if you happen to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.289" end="01:02:17.279" style="s2">purloin their laptop and then you might</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.359" end="01:02:20.249" style="s2">point out to them you know it&#39;s a border</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.279" end="01:02:22.140" style="s2">that protects you from having that thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.249" end="01:02:23.609" style="s2">taken and they say well the border</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.140" end="01:02:25.890" style="s2">should be open it&#39;s okay man no problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.609" end="01:02:27.509" style="s2">you hand over that laptop right now and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.890" end="01:02:28.950" style="s2">everything else you own - if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.509" end="01:02:30.210" style="s2">like borders and you can get rid of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.950" end="01:02:32.279" style="s2">damn walls in your house and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.210" end="01:02:33.869" style="s2">need doors on your bedroom either and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.279" end="01:02:36.239" style="s2">can keep an eye on you whenever we want</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.869" end="01:02:37.410" style="s2">and so much for borders one of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.239" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">things that really differs between</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.410" end="01:02:41.039" style="s2">liberals and conservatives between the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">left and the right is the right is in</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.039" end="01:02:44.880" style="s2">the right leg tight borders between</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:47.279" style="s2">things it&#39;s part of being conscientious</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:50.369" style="s2">at every level conceptually sexually</p>

<p begin="01:02:50.369" end="01:02:53.700" style="s2">right says look let&#39;s keep let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.109" end="01:02:56.519" style="s2">the borders between things pretty</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.700" end="01:02:58.109" style="s2">distinct and the left says yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.519" end="01:02:59.400" style="s2">not because some of those borders are in</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.109" end="01:03:01.019" style="s2">the wrong place and a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.400" end="01:03:03.390" style="s2">free flow of information wouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.019" end="01:03:05.249" style="s2">bad thing and the thing is they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.390" end="01:03:06.900" style="s2">but so are the conservatives and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.249" end="01:03:09.059" style="s2">why you have to talk it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.900" end="01:03:10.769" style="s2">we&#39;ve got some borders that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.059" end="01:03:12.239" style="s2">thing maybe some of them need to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.769" end="01:03:14.069" style="s2">moved around a little bit and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.239" end="01:03:15.749" style="s2">what the political dialogue is for but</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.069" end="01:03:18.029" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that borders</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.749" end="01:03:20.249" style="s2">themselves are a bad idea they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.029" end="01:03:22.229" style="s2">great idea because without borders</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.249" end="01:03:24.539" style="s2">everything mashes into the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.229" end="01:03:27.390" style="s2">untenable state of undifferentiated</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.539" end="01:03:28.680" style="s2">chaos and you can&#39;t live in that and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.390" end="01:03:31.200" style="s2">the people who are trying to tear down</p>

<p begin="01:03:34.950" end="01:03:39.509" style="s2">that or they&#39;re too foolish to know that</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:41.910" style="s2">their pursuits will produce that so</p>

<p begin="01:03:41.910" end="01:03:45.809" style="s2">that if you stand up and say yeah</p>

<p begin="01:03:55.230" end="01:04:00.750" style="s2">actually okay to be someone with some</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.000" end="01:04:02.190" style="s2">sense limits on immigration are also</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.750" end="01:04:04.200" style="s2">reasonable well we need to figure out</p>

<p begin="01:04:13.320" end="01:04:20.030" style="s2">don&#39;t do that is because a complex</p>

<p begin="01:05:01.530" end="01:05:06.540" style="s2">thinking about this a lot lately it</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.660" end="01:05:08.810" style="s2">should not be assumed that citizens of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.540" end="01:05:12.210" style="s2">societies that have not evolved</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.190" end="01:05:23.250" style="s2">there are a lot of countries in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.180" end="01:05:25.260" style="s2">world that are not governed well the</p>

<p begin="01:05:25.260" end="01:05:30.660" style="s2">not governed well forever and to me that</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.680" end="01:05:33.390" style="s2">means that there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.660" end="01:05:34.890" style="s2">the values that are held collectively by</p>

<p begin="01:05:34.890" end="01:05:39.690" style="s2">qualities well you shouldn&#39;t be naive</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:41.550" style="s2">and assume that merely because you move</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.690" end="01:05:44.010" style="s2">them to a new country they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.550" end="01:05:48.500" style="s2">let their innate Democratic longings</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.010" end="01:05:48.500" style="s2">flourish it doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.090" end="01:05:56.530" style="s2">so if you stand up and say look you know</p>

<p begin="01:06:45.280" end="01:06:50.260" style="s2">we figured that out in about 1965 now</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.370" end="01:06:52.660" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing it perfectly you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.260" end="01:06:54.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s not that much later than 1965</p>

<p begin="01:13:40.050" end="01:13:43.980" style="s2">pretty damn fast just so you know it so</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.270" end="01:13:46.409" style="s2">you have about a ten percent chance of</p>

<p begin="01:13:50.670" end="01:13:55.980" style="s2">that but it&#39;s fast it&#39;s the 1% is stable</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.360" end="01:13:58.170" style="s2">as a phenomena but it turns over very</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.980" end="01:14:00.330" style="s2">rapidly in terms of who occupies it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.170" end="01:14:02.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the same in every society the</p>

<p begin="01:16:48.910" end="01:16:52.630" style="s2">too so and that&#39;s why young people are</p>

<p begin="01:16:52.630" end="01:16:58.420" style="s2">about responsibilities here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.900" end="01:17:01.270" style="s2">one radical change should be viewed with</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.420" end="01:17:04.720" style="s2">suspicion particularly in a time of</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.270" end="01:17:06.310" style="s2">radical change okay there&#39;s never been a</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.720" end="01:17:07.750" style="s2">time in the history of the world where</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.310" end="01:17:10.000" style="s2">things are changing as fast as they are</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.750" end="01:17:12.070" style="s2">now and not only are they changing fast</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.000" end="01:17:14.790" style="s2">the rate at which they&#39;re changing is</p>

<p begin="01:17:20.830" end="01:17:25.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s not so bad to have some</p>

<p begin="01:17:25.180" end="01:17:29.230" style="s2">or digging their heels in and say look</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.830" end="01:17:31.720" style="s2">we got a lot to swallow already with a</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.230" end="01:17:33.400" style="s2">lot to chew on and digest let&#39;s not muck</p>

<p begin="01:17:33.400" end="01:17:37.840" style="s2">far what has worked it&#39;s not such a bad</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.180" end="01:17:40.660" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.840" end="01:17:42.790" style="s2">for people to have long term families</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.660" end="01:17:44.890" style="s2">right we could say let&#39;s try to support</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.790" end="01:17:46.990" style="s2">the family we could even say let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.890" end="01:17:50.080" style="s2">to support the traditional family why</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.990" end="01:17:52.060" style="s2">well maybe boys and girls need role</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.080" end="01:17:53.860" style="s2">models of each sex I know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.060" end="01:17:56.740" style="s2">terrible thing to say but it is possible</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.860" end="01:17:59.410" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly the case too that intact</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.740" end="01:18:01.960" style="s2">two-parent families have children that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.410" end="01:18:03.790" style="s2">thrive more than broken families and</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.960" end="01:18:05.470" style="s2">broken families are a catastrophe for</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.790" end="01:18:07.090" style="s2">everyone now you might say well I</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.470" end="01:18:08.920" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t stay with someone that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.090" end="01:18:10.810" style="s2">get along with and it&#39;s like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.920" end="01:18:12.130" style="s2">fair enough except that there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.810" end="01:18:13.450" style="s2">that you&#39;re ever going to find to stay</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.130" end="01:18:15.100" style="s2">with it you&#39;re going to get along with</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.450" end="01:18:17.500" style="s2">all of the time especially in your</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.100" end="01:18:18.460" style="s2">shoddy condition so you&#39;re lucky that</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.500" end="01:18:20.050" style="s2">anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.460" end="01:18:21.849" style="s2">you&#39;re lucky that anybody will put up</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.050" end="01:18:24.219" style="s2">with you for a week much less your whole</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.849" end="01:18:26.050" style="s2">life it&#39;s like the point of marriage is</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.219" end="01:18:27.940" style="s2">to tough it out and you don&#39;t tough it</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.050" end="01:18:29.679" style="s2">out for your happiness that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.940" end="01:18:31.869" style="s2">you&#39;re in there for you&#39;re tough it out</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.679" end="01:18:33.880" style="s2">so that you have someone to tie the rope</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.869" end="01:18:35.739" style="s2">of your life together with that you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.880" end="01:18:37.570" style="s2">a chance to tie the rope of your life</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.739" end="01:18:39.429" style="s2">together with the Rope of someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.570" end="01:18:41.290" style="s2">life and to make it strong and to make a</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.429" end="01:18:43.630" style="s2">place the children can have some</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.290" end="01:18:46.210" style="s2">security and some encouragement and</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.630" end="01:18:48.310" style="s2">thereby contribute to the future and pay</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.210" end="01:18:50.260" style="s2">for the miracles of your birth and your</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.310" end="01:18:52.599" style="s2">own raising that&#39;s why you get married</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.260" end="01:18:54.369" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason that conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.599" end="01:18:56.650" style="s2">can&#39;t stand up and say look we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.369" end="01:18:58.780" style="s2">willing to tolerate alternative family</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.650" end="01:19:00.670" style="s2">arrangements but when you start making</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.780" end="01:19:03.699" style="s2">the claim that the traditional family</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.670" end="01:19:05.380" style="s2">unit is just another construct and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.699" end="01:19:07.659" style="s2">it&#39;s not something fundamental to our</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.380" end="01:19:09.969" style="s2">polity it&#39;s like that&#39;s you&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.659" end="01:19:11.860" style="s2">your damn argument too far first of all</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.969" end="01:19:13.540" style="s2">you have no evidence whatsoever for that</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.860" end="01:19:15.460" style="s2">claim and there&#39;s plenty of counter</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.540" end="01:19:17.830" style="s2">evidence so you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.460" end="01:19:19.090" style="s2">the post modernists basically say is you</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.830" end="01:19:20.590" style="s2">know every time you stand up for</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.090" end="01:19:23.290" style="s2">something you&#39;re also standing against</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.590" end="01:19:24.580" style="s2">something it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.290" end="01:19:26.949" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.580" end="01:19:28.900" style="s2">stand up for things and I think if what</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.949" end="01:19:30.849" style="s2">if there is something that conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.900" end="01:19:33.550" style="s2">could agree on that we could stand up</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.849" end="01:19:34.719" style="s2">for it&#39;s the nuclear family now exactly</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.550" end="01:19:37.570" style="s2">how that&#39;s going to play out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.719" end="01:19:40.150" style="s2">exactly know but it&#39;s nothing to discuss</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.570" end="01:19:41.530" style="s2">anything to be ashamed of to say well it</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.150" end="01:19:42.940" style="s2">kind of looks like that structures</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.530" end="01:19:45.429" style="s2">worked quite well for the entire</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.940" end="01:19:48.449" style="s2">duration of mankind and so maybe we mess</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.429" end="01:19:48.449" style="s2">with it at our peril</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.070" end="01:19:58.270" style="s2">here&#39;s another one the government local</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.230" end="01:20:01.690" style="s2">and distant should lead people to their</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.270" end="01:20:04.390" style="s2">own devices as much as possible why well</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.690" end="01:20:05.980" style="s2">part of its just humility it&#39;s like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.390" end="01:20:07.630" style="s2">rather that there was a million of you</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.980" end="01:20:09.880" style="s2">out there making your own stupid</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.630" end="01:20:13.210" style="s2">mistakes so that maybe a thousand of you</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.880" end="01:20:15.580" style="s2">can get it right then for one of you to</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.210" end="01:20:17.680" style="s2">impose their view on everyone and risk</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.580" end="01:20:19.390" style="s2">getting it catastrophic ly wrong for</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.680" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">everyone at the same time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.390" end="01:20:22.840" style="s2">really the alternative like if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.040" end="01:20:24.310" style="s2">social scientist like I mean an actual</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.840" end="01:20:25.960" style="s2">scientist I don&#39;t mean a bloody</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.310" end="01:20:28.150" style="s2">ideologue one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.960" end="01:20:29.590" style="s2">learn very rapidly is you know you do a</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.150" end="01:20:30.820" style="s2">simple experiment you think you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.590" end="01:20:32.740" style="s2">to predict some element of human</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.820" end="01:20:34.120" style="s2">behavior so here&#39;s my hypothesis I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.740" end="01:20:35.920" style="s2">going to put people in this experimental</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.120" end="01:20:37.600" style="s2">situation and this is what they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.920" end="01:20:39.640" style="s2">to do and then you run the experiment</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.600" end="01:20:41.590" style="s2">and they don&#39;t do that they do something</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.640" end="01:20:43.030" style="s2">completely different you find out that</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.590" end="01:20:45.370" style="s2">even though what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.030" end="01:20:46.330" style="s2">really simple you have a clue what</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.370" end="01:20:48.340" style="s2">they&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.330" end="01:20:50.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s just a tiny little controlled</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.340" end="01:20:55.660" style="s2">experiment about one little tiny thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.380" end="01:20:57.670" style="s2">and you&#39;re wrong it&#39;s like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.660" end="01:21:01.570" style="s2">great advantages to conservative</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.670" end="01:21:03.900" style="s2">philosophy is that its humble its humble</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.570" end="01:21:05.830" style="s2">from from the perspective of social</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.900" end="01:21:07.540" style="s2">experimentation it&#39;s like it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.830" end="01:21:09.340" style="s2">everything&#39;s great and we should just</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.540" end="01:21:12.220" style="s2">continue going the way we&#39;re going it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.340" end="01:21:15.550" style="s2">like well everything isn&#39;t as broken as</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.220" end="01:21:17.320" style="s2">it might be and I&#39;m kind of stupid and</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.550" end="01:21:19.480" style="s2">blind and all I have is a bat and</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.320" end="01:21:21.550" style="s2">probably hitting it isn&#39;t going to make</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.480" end="01:21:26.410" style="s2">it any better all do is shatter it and</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.550" end="01:21:29.710" style="s2">so the conservative says it&#39;s working be</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.410" end="01:21:31.180" style="s2">quiet sneak away maybe it&#39;ll quit keep</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.710" end="01:21:32.860" style="s2">working and that&#39;s a perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.180" end="01:21:34.780" style="s2">reasonable perspective now obviously</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.860" end="01:21:36.700" style="s2">sometimes things have to change but the</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.780" end="01:21:38.890" style="s2">conservative can come up and say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.700" end="01:21:40.780" style="s2">be thinking that you have so much</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.890" end="01:21:42.490" style="s2">evidence that what you&#39;re doing is right</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.780" end="01:21:44.110" style="s2">or that it will have the outcome that</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.490" end="01:21:45.730" style="s2">you expect it I&#39;ll tell you a quick</p>

<p begin="01:21:56.740" end="01:22:00.580" style="s2">tough person she did a study in a place</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.170" end="01:22:02.950" style="s2">called Somerville in the United States</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.580" end="01:22:04.660" style="s2">and Massachusetts in the 1930s Fame</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.950" end="01:22:06.520" style="s2">study and so here is the deal they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.660" end="01:22:07.900" style="s2">identified a bunch of inner-city kids in</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.520" end="01:22:09.220" style="s2">rough neighborhoods and felt you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.900" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">that they were more likely to be on a</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.220" end="01:22:13.510" style="s2">criminal track criminal antisocial</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:15.700" style="s2">undereducated alcohol you know the whole</p>

<p begin="01:22:15.700" end="01:22:19.270" style="s2">phenomena thing was going on and so they</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.740" end="01:22:21.940" style="s2">thought well let&#39;s do an intervention</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.270" end="01:22:24.580" style="s2">let&#39;s set up programs to help these kids</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.940" end="01:22:28.080" style="s2">and see if we can you see if we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.580" end="01:22:31.510" style="s2">change their developmental pathways so</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.080" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">they designed to find study bound I have</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.510" end="01:22:37.210" style="s2">the kids I&#39;ll get the details wrong but</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:38.830" style="s2">I got the I got the story right um they</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.210" end="01:22:40.720" style="s2">had the kids they made them more</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.830" end="01:22:42.400" style="s2">literate they educated the more they had</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.720" end="01:22:45.400" style="s2">their parents take training courses they</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.400" end="01:22:46.930" style="s2">did social skills training like they did</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.400" end="01:22:49.570" style="s2">all sorts of things to try to make the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.930" end="01:22:51.430" style="s2">kids lives turn out better and to top it</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.570" end="01:22:53.530" style="s2">all off because the kids were stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.430" end="01:22:55.090" style="s2">the inner city they took them all out to</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.530" end="01:22:57.100" style="s2">summer camp for a couple of weeks a year</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.090" end="01:22:58.600" style="s2">and so they could get away from the city</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.100" end="01:23:00.730" style="s2">and you know enjoy the countryside and</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.600" end="01:23:03.130" style="s2">have a little bit of a vacation a little</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.730" end="01:23:04.720" style="s2">taste of a higher quality life yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.130" end="01:23:06.310" style="s2">great everyone&#39;s thrilled with the dam</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.720" end="01:23:08.320" style="s2">program the kids are having a great time</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.310" end="01:23:09.610" style="s2">at camp the counselors are thrilled the</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.320" end="01:23:11.920" style="s2">psychologists they think they&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.610" end="01:23:14.020" style="s2">wonderful job with great it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.920" end="01:23:17.740" style="s2">beautifully except then they did the</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.020" end="01:23:19.000" style="s2">data analysis guess what happened the</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.740" end="01:23:20.530" style="s2">kids in the canoe in their treatment</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.000" end="01:23:21.550" style="s2">group there was a control group right</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.530" end="01:23:23.260" style="s2">that didn&#39;t get all this special</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.550" end="01:23:25.060" style="s2">treatment randomly assigned it was a</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.260" end="01:23:26.680" style="s2">very nice experiment the kids in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.060" end="01:23:32.250" style="s2">treatment group did worse on virtually</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.680" end="01:23:34.750" style="s2">everything that was measured worse why</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.250" end="01:23:36.160" style="s2">don&#39;t put antisocial kids together in</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.750" end="01:23:39.490" style="s2">the same camp for two weeks during the</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.160" end="01:23:41.290" style="s2">year right right because what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.490" end="01:23:43.300" style="s2">that the bad kids teach the slightly</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.290" end="01:23:46.060" style="s2">less bad kids to be worse it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.300" end="01:23:47.830" style="s2">well-documented phenomena that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.060" end="01:23:50.050" style="s2">what happens in prisons happens in</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.830" end="01:23:51.520" style="s2">prisons what we do with criminals is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.050" end="01:23:53.080" style="s2">worst thing you could possibly do to</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.520" end="01:23:54.940" style="s2">criminals if you don&#39;t want them to</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.080" end="01:23:56.410" style="s2">continue to be criminals except for the</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.940" end="01:23:58.180" style="s2">fact that you keep them in there till</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.410" end="01:23:59.350" style="s2">they&#39;re old enough generally speaking so</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.180" end="01:24:01.000" style="s2">they&#39;re less likely to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.350" end="01:24:02.950" style="s2">criminal activity but what was learned</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.000" end="01:24:04.600" style="s2">from the Somerville study was don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.950" end="01:24:06.040" style="s2">so sure your good intentions are going</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.600" end="01:24:07.960" style="s2">to produce the results that you intend</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.040" end="01:24:09.160" style="s2">because they probably won&#39;t and they</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.960" end="01:24:10.990" style="s2">probably won&#39;t for reasons that you</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.160" end="01:24:14.680" style="s2">never even imagined and the other one</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.990" end="01:24:16.630" style="s2">was don&#39;t group bad kids with good kids</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.680" end="01:24:16.909" style="s2">on the assumption that the good kids</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.630" end="01:24:19.159" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.909" end="01:24:21.079" style="s2">make the bad kids better because that</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.159" end="01:24:23.599" style="s2">isn&#39;t what happens what happens is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.079" end="01:24:25.639" style="s2">reverse if you put two or three bad kids</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.599" end="01:24:27.469" style="s2">with a bunch of good kids then the good</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.639" end="01:24:29.689" style="s2">kids get worse the bad kids don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.469" end="01:24:30.979" style="s2">better very well-documented social</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.689" end="01:24:32.300" style="s2">science finding well the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.979" end="01:24:34.099" style="s2">telling you the Somerville story is</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.300" end="01:24:36.769" style="s2">because God who could argue with that</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.099" end="01:24:38.719" style="s2">study right it&#39;s like these kids were</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.769" end="01:24:40.099" style="s2">poor they were struggling it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.719" end="01:24:41.719" style="s2">want to you want to lift them up you</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.099" end="01:24:44.380" style="s2">want to make their life better you do</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.719" end="01:24:46.699" style="s2">this wonderful expensive well-motivated</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.380" end="01:24:48.050" style="s2">experiment and then you run the damn</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.699" end="01:24:49.459" style="s2">data analysis and you find out that</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.050" end="01:24:51.619" style="s2">there was one thing wrong with your</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.459" end="01:24:53.360" style="s2">social intervention philosophy that you</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.619" end="01:24:55.999" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand and you actually made</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.360" end="01:24:57.979" style="s2">it worse well that&#39;s a and so Joel Joel</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.999" end="01:24:59.479" style="s2">McCord she spent much of the rest of her</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.979" end="01:25:01.550" style="s2">life going around telling social</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.479" end="01:25:03.619" style="s2">scientists when you run a social</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.550" end="01:25:05.239" style="s2">experiment politicians the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.619" end="01:25:06.679" style="s2">when do you run a social experiment</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.239" end="01:25:08.959" style="s2">especially on a large number of people</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.679" end="01:25:11.630" style="s2">especially without their consent then</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.959" end="01:25:13.699" style="s2">gather the data and do the follow-up</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.630" end="01:25:15.800" style="s2">study because it&#39;s highly probable that</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.699" end="01:25:17.719" style="s2">you&#39;ll find that what you did didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.800" end="01:25:19.249" style="s2">work or maybe it even worked backwards</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.719" end="01:25:21.110" style="s2">and you&#39;ll never know that unless you do</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.249" end="01:25:23.269" style="s2">the study and so what people took away</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.110" end="01:25:24.979" style="s2">from that the social interventionist</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.269" end="01:25:27.349" style="s2">types took away from that was whatever</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.979" end="01:25:31.219" style="s2">you do with your social intervention</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.349" end="01:25:34.369" style="s2">policy don&#39;t run the study right right</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.219" end="01:25:36.199" style="s2">that was the wrong lesson by the way ok</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.369" end="01:25:38.269" style="s2">and this is what I would close with for</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.199" end="01:25:42.139" style="s2">the conservatives this is a nice one I</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.269" end="01:25:44.239" style="s2">really like this we hear a lot about the</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.139" end="01:25:46.189" style="s2">sins of the West and their manifold</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.239" end="01:25:48.019" style="s2">because people are corrupt and our</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.189" end="01:25:49.369" style="s2">societies are corrupt but you have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.019" end="01:25:50.570" style="s2">think about it in terms of relative</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.369" end="01:25:54.289" style="s2">corruption rather than absolute</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.570" end="01:25:56.389" style="s2">corruption it&#39;s like well you know your</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.289" end="01:25:58.669" style="s2">family is not perfect but there are</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.389" end="01:26:00.409" style="s2">worse families compared to the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.669" end="01:26:01.909" style="s2">family your family isn&#39;t looking so good</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.409" end="01:26:04.010" style="s2">but compared to other families maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.909" end="01:26:05.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not looking so bad at all ok so how</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.010" end="01:26:08.209" style="s2">do we judge our political system well we</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.959" end="01:26:10.900" style="s2">don&#39;t judge it by the dreamlike</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.209" end="01:26:13.489" style="s2">ill-informed ideologically motivated</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.900" end="01:26:15.380" style="s2">pathological utopia&#39;s of the radical</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.489" end="01:26:17.389" style="s2">left or the radical right for that</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.380" end="01:26:19.639" style="s2">matter we saw what happened in the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.389" end="01:26:21.650" style="s2">century when you do that that is a very</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.639" end="01:26:23.239" style="s2">very bad idea and you know there were</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.650" end="01:26:25.550" style="s2">tens of millions of people that died in</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.239" end="01:26:28.039" style="s2">the 20th century demonstrating just how</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.550" end="01:26:30.590" style="s2">bad an idea was that was and you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.039" end="01:26:32.000" style="s2">we would have learned that but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.590" end="01:26:33.770" style="s2">what you do instead is you take a look</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.000" end="01:26:36.530" style="s2">at your country and you think okay how</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.770" end="01:26:39.650" style="s2">is it doing compared to other countries</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.530" end="01:26:40.810" style="s2">other actual real countries and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.650" end="01:26:42.920" style="s2">you look at a variety of different</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.810" end="01:26:44.630" style="s2">indicators because that&#39;s what you do if</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.920" end="01:26:47.000" style="s2">you&#39;re careful and if it happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.630" end="01:26:50.540" style="s2">hovering up near the top then you think</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.000" end="01:26:52.909" style="s2">well might be just the grace of God</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.540" end="01:26:55.250" style="s2">might be just good fortune but it is</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.909" end="01:26:56.780" style="s2">possible that we&#39;ve got something right</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.250" end="01:26:58.790" style="s2">and that we shouldn&#39;t muck around with</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.780" end="01:27:01.280" style="s2">it too much and then we should have some</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.790" end="01:27:02.989" style="s2">gratitude for it instead of assuming</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.280" end="01:27:04.880" style="s2">that the proper comparison is whatever</p>

<p begin="01:28:29.869" end="01:28:33.290" style="s2">and the reason for that is your</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.130" end="01:28:35.270" style="s2">misogynistic bigoted and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.290" end="01:28:37.670" style="s2">believe that and I can&#39;t measure it by</p>

<p begin="01:28:58.370" end="01:29:02.750" style="s2">I would say to people who want to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.620" end="01:29:04.460" style="s2">conservative first of all you have every</p>

<p begin="01:29:07.730" end="01:29:13.960" style="s2">time to get the hell organized and push</p>

<p begin="01:31:03.300" end="01:31:07.110" style="s2">more opinions of mine so you can take</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.820" end="01:31:09.150" style="s2">them or leave them as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.110" end="01:31:11.070" style="s2">concerned but these 12 points that I</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.150" end="01:31:12.630" style="s2">made as far as I can tell you know those</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.070" end="01:31:14.760" style="s2">are reasons to be conservative and</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.630" end="01:31:16.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not reasons to be ashamed of it</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.760" end="01:31:18.870" style="s2">and if you&#39;re afraid of speaking your</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.440" end="01:31:21.120" style="s2">mind as a conservative well stumble a</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.870" end="01:31:22.380" style="s2">bit make a few mistakes man you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.120" end="01:31:24.270" style="s2">to make some mistakes you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.380" end="01:31:25.620" style="s2">you know not as articulate as you might</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.270" end="01:31:27.630" style="s2">be and believe me there&#39;s lots of things</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.620" end="01:31:29.670" style="s2">you need to know but if you start saying</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.630" end="01:31:31.050" style="s2">what you think carefully people will</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.670" end="01:31:33.030" style="s2">correct you and you&#39;ll get better at it</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.050" end="01:31:35.730" style="s2">and you better start doing it because</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.030" end="01:31:37.530" style="s2">the situation that we&#39;re in I think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:31:37.530" end="01:31:43.710" style="s2">to me so anyways that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.760" end="01:31:45.950" style="s2">say about that so thank you for the</p>

<p begin="01:31:53.350" end="01:31:59.380" style="s2">Lucky&#39;s going to open up for questions</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.900" end="01:32:01.810" style="s2">and hopefully some answers as well so if</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.380" end="01:32:03.880" style="s2">anybody has anything we only have one</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.810" end="01:32:08.140" style="s2">microphone so you&#39;ll have to stand up</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.880" end="01:32:42.520" style="s2">you I would like you to speak loudly and</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.140" end="01:32:45.820" style="s2">clearly so we can all hear and sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.520" end="01:32:48.489" style="s2">sure ask an easy question so the</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.820" end="01:32:50.710" style="s2">question essentially was what my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.489" end="01:32:53.080" style="s2">was about the separation of church and</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.710" end="01:32:56.080" style="s2">state the nature of the separation of</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.080" end="01:32:58.120" style="s2">church and state given the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.080" end="01:33:01.180" style="s2">that our society is grounded in a</p>

<p begin="01:33:01.180" end="01:33:05.230" style="s2">say that has a something like a</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.070" end="01:33:07.300" style="s2">theological a predicated philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.230" end="01:33:10.840" style="s2">basis it&#39;s something like that the first</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.300" end="01:33:12.910" style="s2">thing I would say is if you if that is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.840" end="01:33:15.520" style="s2">very hard question to answer and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.910" end="01:33:17.500" style="s2">doing this series in Toronto right now</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.520" end="01:33:19.210" style="s2">on on it&#39;s called the psychological</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.500" end="01:33:22.060" style="s2">significance of the biblical stories and</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.210" end="01:33:23.950" style="s2">it&#39;s an answer to that question but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.060" end="01:33:25.060" style="s2">long it&#39;s like 40 hours you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.950" end="01:33:27.730" style="s2">and it&#39;s like the maps of meaning</p>

<p begin="01:33:27.730" end="01:33:32.110" style="s2">to before it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.290" end="01:33:34.690" style="s2">complicated and I mean I think the right</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.110" end="01:33:37.150" style="s2">approach to that is to say something</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.690" end="01:33:38.770" style="s2">like that something like there are</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.150" end="01:33:40.510" style="s2">things that are Caesar&#39;s and there are</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.770" end="01:33:42.280" style="s2">things that are gods and you should keep</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.510" end="01:33:44.440" style="s2">those things apart that&#39;s worked in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.280" end="01:33:46.239" style="s2">West now the problem without our answer</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.440" end="01:33:48.040" style="s2">is it doesn&#39;t precisely describe the</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.239" end="01:33:49.600" style="s2">proper interrelationship between the two</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.040" end="01:33:51.489" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.600" end="01:33:53.410" style="s2">political issue I think that the way</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.489" end="01:33:55.420" style="s2">that that&#39;s properly bridged is through</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.410" end="01:33:58.150" style="s2">the ethic of the individual it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.420" end="01:33:59.860" style="s2">your religious belief should be of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.150" end="01:34:03.010" style="s2">sort that guides you to be an honest</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.860" end="01:34:06.130" style="s2">decent productive respectable person</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.010" end="01:34:07.000" style="s2">who&#39;s aiming at the good and then if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.130" end="01:34:08.290" style="s2">do that then the</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.000" end="01:34:10.810" style="s2">political issues will take care of</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.290" end="01:34:13.000" style="s2">themselves not magically but because</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.810" end="01:34:14.890" style="s2">we&#39;ll organize ourselves politically as</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.000" end="01:34:17.380" style="s2">that sort of people and do the right</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.890" end="01:34:18.970" style="s2">things and so I think the connection</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.380" end="01:34:20.560" style="s2">between the church and the state is</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.970" end="01:34:22.210" style="s2">through the individual that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.560" end="01:34:23.590" style="s2">should work and I think that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.210" end="01:34:24.730" style="s2">kind of worked in the West you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.590" end="01:34:27.070" style="s2">getting that church-state separation</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.730" end="01:34:28.570" style="s2">thing right that&#39;s really difficult it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.070" end="01:34:30.610" style="s2">not good when they collapse into one</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.570" end="01:34:33.190" style="s2">another because you instantly get the</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.610" end="01:34:37.320" style="s2">rise of like totalitarian theocracies we</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.190" end="01:34:40.090" style="s2">all know how much fun they are so yep</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.320" end="01:34:41.740" style="s2">everything I&#39;ll just listen that what</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.090" end="01:34:43.840" style="s2">you understand what we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.740" end="01:34:45.400" style="s2">just make this work if you do we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.840" end="01:34:47.830" style="s2">a question once you come up to the front</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.400" end="01:34:50.320" style="s2">I&#39;ll hand over the microphone to you and</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.830" end="01:34:52.990" style="s2">then you can everybody can hear the</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.320" end="01:34:59.230" style="s2">question clearly and then we&#39;ll pass the</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.990" end="01:35:04.240" style="s2">microphone back hi I&#39;m Brian Doyle a</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.230" end="01:35:10.690" style="s2">little loose key so people I warned you</p>

<p begin="01:35:10.690" end="01:35:15.940" style="s2">expectations thank you very much less</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.700" end="01:35:19.120" style="s2">people right the only thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.940" end="01:35:23.500" style="s2">appointed is I don&#39;t see much diversity</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.120" end="01:35:26.770" style="s2">in the crowd and I have a black Somali</p>

<p begin="01:35:38.500" end="01:35:45.250" style="s2">probably one thing that&#39;s missing here</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.690" end="01:35:47.140" style="s2">tonight yeah well looked at that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.250" end="01:35:50.530" style="s2">something else I&#39;d like to suggest to</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.140" end="01:35:52.690" style="s2">conservatives now you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.530" end="01:35:54.190" style="s2">interacted with very diverse range of</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.690" end="01:35:55.810" style="s2">people partly because I&#39;m a clinical</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.190" end="01:35:57.370" style="s2">psychologist and I&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.810" end="01:36:02.410" style="s2">different things with different people</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.370" end="01:36:04.000" style="s2">in my life and so I can speak about this</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.410" end="01:36:06.910" style="s2">particular issue with a modicum of</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.000" end="01:36:09.100" style="s2">authority see in Canada what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.910" end="01:36:11.560" style="s2">is that we left the minority immigrants</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.100" end="01:36:13.150" style="s2">to the Liberals that was a bad idea now</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.560" end="01:36:14.230" style="s2">the reason for that is because the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.150" end="01:36:16.090" style="s2">Liberals have a more liberal immigration</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.230" end="01:36:20.290" style="s2">policy and a lot of them are like really</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.090" end="01:36:20.560" style="s2">really what would you say grateful to</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.290" end="01:36:23.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.560" end="01:36:25.570" style="s2">often to Trudeau personally I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.200" end="01:36:27.250" style="s2">older Trudeau personally because he</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.570" end="01:36:28.600" style="s2">opened the door and let them in and and</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.250" end="01:36:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to shake that but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.600" end="01:36:31.810" style="s2">something that&#39;s very cool for</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.920" end="01:36:33.790" style="s2">conservatives to know you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.810" end="01:36:35.890" style="s2">conservative man you should go talk to</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.790" end="01:36:37.360" style="s2">immigrants they&#39;re so conservative they</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.890" end="01:36:39.430" style="s2">make you look like social justice</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.360" end="01:36:41.890" style="s2">warriors right so there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.430" end="01:36:44.380" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s a real conversation</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.890" end="01:36:47.050" style="s2">to be had with immigrants and minorities</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.380" end="01:36:52.690" style="s2">in Canada is better story especially the</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.050" end="01:36:53.680" style="s2">immigrant minorities and that is look we</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.690" end="01:36:55.360" style="s2">would have been a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.680" end="01:36:56.710" style="s2">restrictive in the past about our</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.360" end="01:36:59.950" style="s2">immigration policies and I can</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.710" end="01:37:02.350" style="s2">understand why that might mark us out as</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.950" end="01:37:04.870" style="s2">enemies to you but one of the things you</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.350" end="01:37:08.170" style="s2">have to understand is that the bedrock</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.870" end="01:37:09.940" style="s2">values that I have are much closer to</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.170" end="01:37:11.860" style="s2">the bedrock values than you that you</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.940" end="01:37:15.070" style="s2">have then the people that you&#39;re voting</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.860" end="01:37:16.900" style="s2">for and you know the minority immigrants</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.070" end="01:37:18.370" style="s2">in Ontario in particular a certain</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.900" end="01:37:20.110" style="s2">figure this out especially with regards</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.370" end="01:37:22.420" style="s2">to Kathleen Wynne&#39;s education policies</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.110" end="01:37:24.190" style="s2">because they notice the tilt of those</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.420" end="01:37:25.720" style="s2">policies and they notice that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.190" end="01:37:28.750" style="s2">not in keeping with their often</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.720" end="01:37:29.800" style="s2">extremely conservative traditions and so</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.750" end="01:37:32.590" style="s2">I would say the right thing for</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.800" end="01:37:34.360" style="s2">conservatives to do is like start</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.590" end="01:37:35.920" style="s2">telling the minority immigrants that</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.360" end="01:37:38.560" style="s2">you&#39;re actually their friends</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.920" end="01:37:40.990" style="s2">now that means to establish an</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.560" end="01:37:42.640" style="s2">intelligent immigration policy and</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.990" end="01:37:44.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a very difficult thing to do and</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.640" end="01:37:46.540" style="s2">to begin a real dialogue about that with</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.470" end="01:37:48.520" style="s2">immigrant communities you know who are</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.540" end="01:37:50.920" style="s2">often by the way very interested in</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.520" end="01:37:52.960" style="s2">protecting what they found here and not</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.920" end="01:37:54.970" style="s2">having it disrupted in any particularly</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.960" end="01:37:57.550" style="s2">terrible way I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.970" end="01:37:58.870" style="s2">know radicals everywhere but most of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.550" end="01:38:00.340" style="s2">immigrants who come here they&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.870" end="01:38:01.900" style="s2">damn I&#39;m happy to be here so the</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.340" end="01:38:04.360" style="s2">Conservatives should be out there</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.900" end="01:38:05.770" style="s2">extending a real hand especially I would</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.360" end="01:38:08.170" style="s2">say especially to the moderate Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.770" end="01:38:09.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a big mistake not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.170" end="01:38:12.160" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of moderate Muslims they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.610" end="01:38:13.900" style="s2">people who they&#39;re not enchanted by the</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.160" end="01:38:15.640" style="s2">theocratic totalitarians and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.900" end="01:38:17.860" style="s2">looking for a way to develop a bridge</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.640" end="01:38:19.540" style="s2">between Islam in the West that&#39;s no easy</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.860" end="01:38:21.760" style="s2">thing I&#39;m not even sure it can be done</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.540" end="01:38:23.650" style="s2">but there are people of goodwill in our</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.760" end="01:38:25.270" style="s2">country who would like to have that</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.650" end="01:38:28.120" style="s2">happen and the Conservatives could be</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.270" end="01:38:30.550" style="s2">talking to them and and and extending a</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.120" end="01:38:33.250" style="s2">hand it&#39;s going to help on the on the</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.550" end="01:38:34.389" style="s2">what on the on the voting front as well</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.250" end="01:38:36.100" style="s2">there&#39;s no loss</p>

<p begin="01:38:41.710" end="01:38:45.489" style="s2">they&#39;ll wake up they&#39;ll see it and then</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.110" end="01:38:47.850" style="s2">they&#39;ll say well you know maybe we have</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.489" end="01:38:49.929" style="s2">more in common with the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.850" end="01:38:51.880" style="s2">conservatives in Canada than we thought</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.929" end="01:38:57.040" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be a difficult message to</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.880" end="01:38:58.869" style="s2">get to get out there so yeah I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="01:38:58.869" end="01:39:05.280" style="s2">Brian forgit for a moment and I think</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.900" end="01:39:07.960" style="s2">it&#39;s important to recognize the</p>

<p begin="01:39:50.380" end="01:39:58.960" style="s2">place it&#39;s going to be a very different</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.989" end="01:40:03.190" style="s2">image than walking through Toronto or or</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.960" end="01:40:05.139" style="s2">Ottawa so that&#39;s it I&#39;m very pleased to</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.190" end="01:40:07.929" style="s2">see the number of people that we have</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.139" end="01:40:11.800" style="s2">out here the diversity of age in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.929" end="01:40:15.369" style="s2">diversity of people but but we just</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.800" end="01:40:20.190" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of immigrants in rural</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.369" end="01:40:20.190" style="s2">Ontario so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.110" end="01:40:36.670" style="s2">so I&#39;ve come to policy but the actual</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.120" end="01:40:38.890" style="s2">concrete issues that people may or may</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.670" end="01:40:40.840" style="s2">not differ on I want to tell you dodging</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.890" end="01:40:42.760" style="s2">like the root cause is strictly per</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.840" end="01:40:44.710" style="s2">month psychological perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.760" end="01:40:47.290" style="s2">everyone derive a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.710" end="01:42:12.100" style="s2">predominantly done like early amid 26</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.290" end="01:42:13.330" style="s2">mar 2014 12 to actually engage in</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.100" end="01:42:15.790" style="s2">dialogue with other people because</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.330" end="01:42:18.190" style="s2">they&#39;ll expose you to their set of facts</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.790" end="01:42:19.480" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that facts don&#39;t exist or</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.190" end="01:42:21.880" style="s2">that they&#39;re relativistic or anything</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.480" end="01:42:23.470" style="s2">like that one of the things we found out</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.880" end="01:42:25.000" style="s2">about the politically correct types is</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.470" end="01:42:26.410" style="s2">that they&#39;re high in a trait called</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.000" end="01:42:28.180" style="s2">agreeableness now you might think</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.410" end="01:42:30.610" style="s2">relation I wasn&#39;t what I would have</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.180" end="01:42:33.730" style="s2">guessed but but agreeableness is a</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.610" end="01:42:35.260" style="s2">maternal trait and women are higher in</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.730" end="01:42:36.790" style="s2">agreeableness than man that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.260" end="01:42:39.310" style="s2">cross-cultural now difference really</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.790" end="01:42:40.989" style="s2">seems to start manifesting itself</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.310" end="01:42:42.610" style="s2">primarily at puberty and so</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.989" end="01:42:44.350" style="s2">agreeableness is likely the trait that</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.610" end="01:42:46.239" style="s2">stops you from throwing your baby out</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.350" end="01:42:47.650" style="s2">the window at 3 in the morning when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.239" end="01:42:49.090" style="s2">beaten when it&#39;s had colic for three</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.650" end="01:42:50.230" style="s2">hours and you haven&#39;t had any sleep and</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.090" end="01:42:52.420" style="s2">you&#39;re not in very good shape and you</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.230" end="01:42:55.150" style="s2">just got laid off it&#39;s like it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.420" end="01:42:57.070" style="s2">very tight bonding mechanism and so what</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.150" end="01:42:59.440" style="s2">happens it&#39;s primarily driven by what</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.070" end="01:43:01.900" style="s2">you might describe as compassion now</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.440" end="01:43:03.580" style="s2">compassion is great for dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.900" end="01:43:05.860" style="s2">infants and maybe it&#39;s great for dealing</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.580" end="01:43:07.600" style="s2">with hurt people and really elderly</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.860" end="01:43:09.190" style="s2">people you know it&#39;s good for taking</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.600" end="01:43:12.100" style="s2">care of people who can&#39;t take care of</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.190" end="01:43:14.050" style="s2">themselves but it&#39;s not a great doctrine</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.100" end="01:43:15.910" style="s2">to be building a political system on and</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.050" end="01:43:17.380" style="s2">so one of the things that happens with</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.910" end="01:43:19.690" style="s2">the more politically correct types by</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.380" end="01:43:22.060" style="s2">temperament is that they&#39;re they suffer</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.690" end="01:43:23.770" style="s2">from an excess of impulsive compassion</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.060" end="01:43:25.570" style="s2">and they assume that if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.770" end="01:43:27.750" style="s2">equitable distribution of anything that</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.570" end="01:43:29.680" style="s2">the people who are at the bottom are all</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.750" end="01:43:31.690" style="s2">victims who should be treated like</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.680" end="01:43:34.090" style="s2">infants and that everyone at the top is</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.690" end="01:43:37.260" style="s2">a vicious snake like predator and and</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.090" end="01:43:41.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s hardwired in some sense now</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.260" end="01:43:44.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a very popular story yeah of course</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.860" end="01:43:47.020" style="s2">of course it&#39;s it and it&#39;s an easy story</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.680" end="01:43:48.580" style="s2">to sell and there&#39;s some truth in it but</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.020" end="01:43:50.860" style="s2">some truth isn&#39;t the same as all the</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.580" end="01:43:53.350" style="s2">truth and so what you see at least in</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.860" end="01:43:55.690" style="s2">part is undifferentiated empathy and</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.350" end="01:43:57.520" style="s2">that is not that&#39;s not a virtue it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.690" end="01:43:59.440" style="s2">a virtue you have to think you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.520" end="01:44:00.930" style="s2">just feel you have to think you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.440" end="01:44:03.760" style="s2">even when you&#39;re taking care of kids</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.930" end="01:44:06.070" style="s2">part of what you&#39;re doing is being</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.760" end="01:44:07.750" style="s2">compassionate but if you&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.070" end="01:44:09.460" style="s2">compassionate towards your kids then you</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.750" end="01:44:11.530" style="s2">do everything for them and if you do</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.460" end="01:44:13.989" style="s2">everything everything for them then they</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.530" end="01:44:15.550" style="s2">grow up useless and they never leave and</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.989" end="01:44:18.550" style="s2">they hate you and they hate everything</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.550" end="01:44:20.410" style="s2">else - it&#39;s a bad idea and so you use</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.550" end="01:44:21.700" style="s2">compassion judiciously you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.410" end="01:44:24.010" style="s2">a rule if you&#39;re working in a place like</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.700" end="01:44:26.410" style="s2">a nursing home and the rule is too harsh</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.010" end="01:44:27.610" style="s2">rule do not do anything for the people</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.410" end="01:44:29.890" style="s2">that you&#39;re taking care of that they can</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.610" end="01:44:31.480" style="s2">do for themselves and so if they have to</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.890" end="01:44:33.160" style="s2">struggle to feed themselves</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.480" end="01:44:35.410" style="s2">you don&#39;t bloody well intervene and feed</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.160" end="01:44:36.969" style="s2">them you let them maintain their damn</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.410" end="01:44:39.160" style="s2">independence and you have to be a</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.969" end="01:44:40.750" style="s2">hard-hearted bastard to do that you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.160" end="01:44:42.850" style="s2">to watch someone struggle like that but</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.750" end="01:44:44.530" style="s2">you&#39;re furthering their long medium to</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.850" end="01:44:45.610" style="s2">long term independence and development</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.530" end="01:44:47.230" style="s2">and you do the same thing with your</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.610" end="01:44:49.390" style="s2">children treating your children like</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.230" end="01:44:51.489" style="s2">they&#39;re endless permanent victims is a</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.390" end="01:44:53.170" style="s2">very bad idea and I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.489" end="01:44:54.789" style="s2">what that&#39;s part of what&#39;s also being</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.170" end="01:44:56.800" style="s2">taught we also know that</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.789" end="01:44:58.690" style="s2">the kids who are more likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.800" end="01:45:00.159" style="s2">rabidly politically correct one of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.690" end="01:45:01.719" style="s2">reasons that they&#39;re more likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.159" end="01:45:04.030" style="s2">that way is because they were taught to</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.719" end="01:45:07.869" style="s2">be that way we found that even exposure</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.030" end="01:45:10.480" style="s2">to a single lecture a single lecture</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.869" end="01:45:13.179" style="s2">that was associated with the politically</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.480" end="01:45:15.489" style="s2">correct dogmatic structure was enough to</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.179" end="01:45:17.530" style="s2">tilt people in that direction so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.489" end="01:45:19.449" style="s2">a temperamental proclivity and then</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.530" end="01:45:21.699" style="s2">there&#39;s failure of Education to address</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.449" end="01:45:24.039" style="s2">that and then there&#39;s the exacerbation</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.699" end="01:45:26.829" style="s2">and exaggeration by the by the people</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.039" end="01:45:28.869" style="s2">who are trying to produce like activists</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.829" end="01:45:30.699" style="s2">by proxy you know one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.869" end="01:45:32.559" style="s2">appalling things I saw for example at</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.699" end="01:45:35.139" style="s2">McMaster when I went to McMaster and got</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.559" end="01:45:37.030" style="s2">you know yelled down by profanity</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.139" end="01:45:38.800" style="s2">shouting people who had the bloody gall</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.030" end="01:45:40.840" style="s2">to hide behind a banner that had a</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.800" end="01:45:42.789" style="s2">hammer and sickle on it for God&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.840" end="01:45:44.199" style="s2">you know if the Nazis would have been</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.789" end="01:45:45.880" style="s2">out there with their swastika there</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.199" end="01:45:47.050" style="s2">would have been hell to pay but because</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.880" end="01:45:49.210" style="s2">it was the hammer and sickle it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.050" end="01:45:51.400" style="s2">it&#39;s okay there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.210" end="01:45:53.260" style="s2">being a communist it&#39;s like sorry about</p>

<p begin="01:45:53.260" end="01:45:58.170" style="s2">folks so they&#39;re out there you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.090" end="01:46:00.639" style="s2">hiding behind this behind this banner</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.170" end="01:46:01.780" style="s2">none of the none of the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.639" end="01:46:04.000" style="s2">teaching them we&#39;re out there they</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.780" end="01:46:04.989" style="s2">bailed out of the damn discussion right</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.000" end="01:46:06.610" style="s2">because there were four people who were</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.989" end="01:46:08.409" style="s2">supposed to talk with me there they all</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.610" end="01:46:09.820" style="s2">vanished they&#39;d leave these student</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.409" end="01:46:11.920" style="s2">proxies to go out there and do their</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.820" end="01:46:14.559" style="s2">dirty work it&#39;s really it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.920" end="01:46:16.449" style="s2">contemptible so you can lay a fair bit</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.559" end="01:46:18.309" style="s2">of the blame at the feet of the people</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.449" end="01:46:20.469" style="s2">who are supposed to be educating them</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.309" end="01:46:24.360" style="s2">but that are instead indoctrinated them</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.469" end="01:46:24.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s what it looks like to me</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.989" end="01:46:33.510" style="s2">I just have a question regarding the</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.960" end="01:46:36.989" style="s2">extreme left using the blank which we</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.510" end="01:46:39.210" style="s2">oftentimes focus in on the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.989" end="01:46:42.330" style="s2">they try to restrict our use of language</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.210" end="01:46:45.719" style="s2">but I also see nowadays there&#39;s a focus</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.330" end="01:46:48.960" style="s2">on redefining any terms would put like</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.719" end="01:46:53.010" style="s2">for locals inside trying to redefine key</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.960" end="01:46:55.770" style="s2">terms of language and by way of example</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.010" end="01:46:57.870" style="s2">I would say genocide the term which is</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.770" end="01:47:03.350" style="s2">you know full of historical significance</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.870" end="01:47:03.350" style="s2">very powerful time out and raw</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.909" end="01:47:22.689" style="s2">thank you very much sorry I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.889" end="01:47:24.399" style="s2">ignoring you I had just made a whole</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.689" end="01:47:26.349" style="s2">lexicon of politically correct words</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.399" end="01:47:28.119" style="s2">today in the car and I wanted to read it</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.349" end="01:47:31.179" style="s2">but unfortunately I can&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.119" end="01:47:34.539" style="s2">so yeah not only do they redefine but</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.179" end="01:47:36.219" style="s2">they also produce new words neologisms</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.539" end="01:47:38.139" style="s2">constantly and one of the things I want</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.219" end="01:47:39.819" style="s2">to do is I&#39;m going to make a video I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.139" end="01:47:41.829" style="s2">going to collect all these words I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.819" end="01:47:43.239" style="s2">going to do it properly I&#39;m going to go</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.829" end="01:47:44.589" style="s2">through a very large corpus of</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.239" end="01:47:46.569" style="s2">postmodern work I&#39;m going to pull out</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.589" end="01:47:48.519" style="s2">the buzzwords I&#39;m going to rank order</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.569" end="01:47:50.019" style="s2">them in terms of their frequency and</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.519" end="01:47:52.599" style="s2">then I&#39;m going to make a video for</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.019" end="01:47:54.099" style="s2">parents and for freshmen and with a</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.599" end="01:47:56.439" style="s2">checklist it says you go through the</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.099" end="01:47:58.089" style="s2">courses and if there&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.439" end="01:47:59.529" style="s2">words you check them off this list and</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.089" end="01:48:01.929" style="s2">if there&#39;s more than you know if you if</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.529" end="01:48:04.599" style="s2">the course score is more than five out</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.929" end="01:48:06.010" style="s2">of whatever on this list and don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.599" end="01:48:11.739" style="s2">that course unless you want to join the</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.010" end="01:48:13.899" style="s2">cult and so yeah really because he I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.739" end="01:48:15.699" style="s2">thought about this you know because one</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.899" end="01:48:17.469" style="s2">of the things I proposed it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.699" end="01:48:18.609" style="s2">radical solution I probably proposed it</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.469" end="01:48:20.019" style="s2">when I was a little more angry than I</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.609" end="01:48:21.249" style="s2">should have been I thought one of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.019" end="01:48:22.749" style="s2">things the provincial government should</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.249" end="01:48:24.969" style="s2">do is cut the funding to higher</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.749" end="01:48:26.439" style="s2">education by 25% and let&#39;s let the</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.969" end="01:48:28.269" style="s2">goddamn intellectuals fight among</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.439" end="01:48:30.339" style="s2">themselves until they straighten out the</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.269" end="01:48:31.839" style="s2">university hierarchies and decide which</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.339" end="01:48:33.549" style="s2">disciplines are valid and which aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.839" end="01:48:35.019" style="s2">now there&#39;s a problem with that well</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.549" end="01:48:36.489" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem a couple of problems</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.019" end="01:48:37.989" style="s2">with that is that first of all it would</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.489" end="01:48:39.849" style="s2">wreak havoc with the universities and</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.989" end="01:48:40.329" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not it that&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.849" end="01:48:42.879" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.329" end="01:48:44.319" style="s2">the second is you got to watch it when</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.879" end="01:48:46.479" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to control the free</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.319" end="01:48:48.399" style="s2">exchange of academic ideas by top-down</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.479" end="01:48:50.499" style="s2">Fiat right because it&#39;s another one of</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.399" end="01:48:52.569" style="s2">those radical social experiments that</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.499" end="01:48:54.189" style="s2">might go wrong and probably will because</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.569" end="01:48:55.689" style="s2">it might be you that decides what</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.189" end="01:48:57.189" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be taught in universities now</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.689" end="01:48:59.649" style="s2">but god only knows who it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.189" end="01:49:01.599" style="s2">in three or four years right so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.649" end="01:49:02.889" style="s2">a problem but I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.599" end="01:49:04.899" style="s2">that should be done is that people</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.889" end="01:49:06.879" style="s2">should be educated so that they can</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.899" end="01:49:08.589" style="s2">determine which of these courses are</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.879" end="01:49:10.539" style="s2">like that in which professors and then</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.589" end="01:49:11.889" style="s2">just stop attending the classes now</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.539" end="01:49:13.299" style="s2">that&#39;s happening anyways by the way</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.889" end="01:49:15.819" style="s2">because the enrollment the humanities</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.299" end="01:49:17.079" style="s2">has plummeted since the 1960s and the</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.819" end="01:49:18.639" style="s2">reason and the humanities are at the</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.079" end="01:49:20.109" style="s2">core of the university make no mistake</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.639" end="01:49:22.539" style="s2">about it if the humanities goes the</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.109" end="01:49:25.389" style="s2">universities are done but so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.539" end="01:49:27.250" style="s2">already destroying their own market</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.389" end="01:49:28.420" style="s2">viability even though they keep bring</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.250" end="01:49:30.220" style="s2">more and more people into the</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.420" end="01:49:32.230" style="s2">universities and colleges but I think</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.220" end="01:49:35.020" style="s2">that needs to be accelerated what what</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.230" end="01:49:36.910" style="s2">has to happen is that the the the</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.020" end="01:49:39.670" style="s2">postmodernist radical types need to be</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.910" end="01:49:42.430" style="s2">cut off at the source students need to</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.670" end="01:49:44.170" style="s2">stop going to their classes and so that</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.430" end="01:49:46.390" style="s2">means that high school students and</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.170" end="01:49:49.810" style="s2">freshmen and the parents of those people</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.390" end="01:49:52.930" style="s2">need to know what to look out for and so</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.810" end="01:49:54.940" style="s2">yes I&#39;m very cognizant of their use of</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.930" end="01:49:58.480" style="s2">language it&#39;s also why I oppose bill C</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.940" end="01:50:00.640" style="s2">16 it&#39;s like I&#39;m not going to say words</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.480" end="01:50:02.260" style="s2">that other people demand that I say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.640" end="01:50:03.580" style="s2">not going to do that and the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.260" end="01:50:06.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to do that is because</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.580" end="01:50:11.500" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anything more important to</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.010" end="01:50:14.170" style="s2">me then the the fact that I have than</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.500" end="01:50:16.570" style="s2">the fact that I know haven&#39;t got that</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.170" end="01:50:19.960" style="s2">right there&#39;s nothing more important to</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.570" end="01:50:21.970" style="s2">me than the responsibility I have to</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.960" end="01:50:26.230" style="s2">utter the words that I believe to be</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.970" end="01:50:29.050" style="s2">true I&#39;m not using someone else&#39;s words</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.230" end="01:50:32.500" style="s2">and Bill c16 by the way which your</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.050" end="01:50:34.930" style="s2">Senate so so delightfully passed today</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.500" end="01:50:39.310" style="s2">makes compelled speech part of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.930" end="01:50:42.400" style="s2">Canadian legal system so a threshold has</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.310" end="01:50:44.950" style="s2">been crossed and you know it&#39;s to help</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.400" end="01:50:47.410" style="s2">the transgendered people it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.950" end="01:50:52.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not that&#39;s not why it happened so</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.410" end="01:50:54.460" style="s2">you don&#39;t see the language game to your</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.150" end="01:50:56.890" style="s2">political enemies you do not allow them</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.460" end="01:51:00.700" style="s2">to force you to use their terminology as</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.890" end="01:51:02.680" style="s2">soon as they do that you lose so and</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.700" end="01:51:04.480" style="s2">that was what bill C 16 was about for me</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.680" end="01:51:06.670" style="s2">and there was something cool about that</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.480" end="01:51:10.510" style="s2">too it was very surprising you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.670" end="01:51:11.500" style="s2">because what should have what should</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.510" end="01:51:13.150" style="s2">have happened was that no one paid any</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.500" end="01:51:14.530" style="s2">damn attention to the videos I made at</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.150" end="01:51:15.850" style="s2">all that&#39;s what should have happened or</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.530" end="01:51:17.620" style="s2">the next thing that should have happened</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.850" end="01:51:19.210" style="s2">is you know there was 15 minutes flurry</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.620" end="01:51:20.890" style="s2">about it then everybody went back to the</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.210" end="01:51:23.350" style="s2">business that didn&#39;t happen either</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.890" end="01:51:25.180" style="s2">what happened was an inordinate amount</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.350" end="01:51:26.680" style="s2">of attention congregated around this</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.180" end="01:51:30.570" style="s2">issue and I&#39;ve been trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.680" end="01:51:33.760" style="s2">why ever since it&#39;s like wow you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.570" end="01:51:35.200" style="s2">something&#39;s something&#39;s rotten in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.760" end="01:51:37.420" style="s2">state of Denmark there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.200" end="01:51:39.580" style="s2">strange going on here and it certainly</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.420" end="01:51:41.020" style="s2">wasn&#39;t because what I was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.580" end="01:51:43.360" style="s2">was about</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.020" end="01:51:45.580" style="s2">issues because it important or</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.360" end="01:51:47.500" style="s2">unimportant as they may be at best</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.580" end="01:51:49.450" style="s2">they&#39;re a side issue right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.500" end="01:51:51.970" style="s2">this isn&#39;t something that affects enough</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.450" end="01:51:53.560" style="s2">people to be of any requisite</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.970" end="01:51:55.690" style="s2">seriousness so why all the attention</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.560" end="01:51:57.640" style="s2">well it&#39;s because there&#39;s something real</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.690" end="01:51:59.920" style="s2">going on underneath it and a lot of that</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.640" end="01:52:02.470" style="s2">is a it&#39;s a fight over language that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.920" end="01:52:04.300" style="s2">why Derrida you know Jacques Derrida he</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.470" end="01:52:06.610" style="s2">criticized Western culture he&#39;s the head</p>

<p begin="01:52:20.320" end="01:52:23.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t that you disagree it&#39;s that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:55:22.749" end="01:55:26.929" style="s2">my suspicions are it&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.099" end="01:55:29.360" style="s2">problem that has to be solved at a micro</p>

<p begin="01:55:31.969" end="01:55:36.409" style="s2">anything other than that I understand</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.030" end="01:55:38.119" style="s2">why you&#39;d find that frustrating</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.409" end="01:55:39.079" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought similar things about the</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.119" end="01:55:42.199" style="s2">way the federal government is</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.079" end="01:55:43.789" style="s2">constituted on the other hand we managed</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.199" end="01:55:45.469" style="s2">to keep the country together and there</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.789" end="01:55:51.679" style="s2">is a sacrifice to be made for that</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.469" end="01:55:53.389" style="s2">so apart from saying you know I get the</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.679" end="01:55:57.999" style="s2">problem like I don&#39;t have anything to</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.389" end="01:55:57.999" style="s2">offer on that so yep</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.330" end="01:56:03.330" style="s2">so I&#39;m actually only going to take one</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.650" end="01:56:04.620" style="s2">more question because I&#39;m tired enough</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.330" end="01:56:06.480" style="s2">so that I&#39;m probably going to say</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.620" end="01:56:08.310" style="s2">something stupid and since this is taped</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.480" end="01:56:10.650" style="s2">well you know you got to watch that</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.310" end="01:56:12.180" style="s2">because you don&#39;t want to say any more</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.650" end="01:56:17.940" style="s2">stupid things than necessary</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.180" end="01:56:19.770" style="s2">no I a little uncomfortable talking to</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.940" end="01:56:22.050" style="s2">you because some what you said really</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.770" end="01:56:23.370" style="s2">made me a little uncomfortable but I</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.050" end="01:56:25.580" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we have to do we have</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.370" end="01:56:27.930" style="s2">to be uncomfortable some of the time</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.580" end="01:56:30.240" style="s2">when you talked about don&#39;t send your</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.930" end="01:56:32.610" style="s2">kids to take humanity I kind of went</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.240" end="01:56:36.030" style="s2">what are you talking about that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.610" end="01:56:39.420" style="s2">I think what you&#39;re saying is the way</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.030" end="01:56:41.700" style="s2">that&#39;s structured now it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.420" end="01:56:44.610" style="s2">dangerous so I guess my question is</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.700" end="01:56:51.330" style="s2">where do we go to get the critical</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.610" end="01:56:54.480" style="s2">thinking skills that we need how do we</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.330" end="01:56:56.160" style="s2">develop them you said the you want high</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.480" end="01:56:57.480" style="s2">school students and parents to be aware</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.160" end="01:56:58.500" style="s2">what the problems are</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.480" end="01:57:00.750" style="s2">where are they going to get these</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.500" end="01:57:01.800" style="s2">critical thinking skills and develop a</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.750" end="01:57:04.620" style="s2">certain resilience</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.800" end="01:57:06.900" style="s2">that&#39;s chanting that world around them</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.620" end="01:57:08.520" style="s2">so where would you direct this ago yeah</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.900" end="01:57:09.630" style="s2">well the first thing I should say is</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.520" end="01:57:11.610" style="s2">like I&#39;m a great admirer of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.630" end="01:57:14.610" style="s2">humanities like and of the universities</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.610" end="01:57:17.100" style="s2">I mean the humanities you learn to be a</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.610" end="01:57:18.750" style="s2">citizen through the humanities the</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.100" end="01:57:21.090" style="s2">humanities are at the core of Western</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.750" end="01:57:23.340" style="s2">culture if they go we&#39;re in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.090" end="01:57:25.530" style="s2">so the problem is is that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.340" end="01:57:27.000" style="s2">manifesting itself as the humanities in</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.530" end="01:57:28.950" style="s2">the Universities is no longer the</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.000" end="01:57:31.320" style="s2">humanities it&#39;s something almost</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.950" end="01:57:34.680" style="s2">virtually the opposite of that and so</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.320" end="01:57:36.420" style="s2">and so when I tell people not to go to</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.680" end="01:57:38.340" style="s2">humanities courses in the Universities</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.420" end="01:57:40.830" style="s2">it&#39;s with a very heavy heart believe me</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.340" end="01:57:43.740" style="s2">you know now the question is where do</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.830" end="01:57:46.680" style="s2">you go instead well that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.740" end="01:57:47.640" style="s2">question you can always read you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.680" end="01:57:49.500" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.640" end="01:57:51.570" style="s2">about Amazon is all the great books are</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.500" end="01:57:54.180" style="s2">free they&#39;re literally free you can go</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.570" end="01:57:56.730" style="s2">download them on your Kindle for nothing</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.180" end="01:57:58.020" style="s2">the copyright has expired and people</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.730" end="01:57:59.700" style="s2">have been putting electronic versions</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.020" end="01:58:01.560" style="s2">online so the great books of the Western</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.700" end="01:58:03.090" style="s2">world and even many of the great books</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.560" end="01:58:05.580" style="s2">of the 20th century are now available</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.090" end="01:58:08.190" style="s2">completely for free well so you can read</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.580" end="01:58:09.870" style="s2">them there&#39;s lots of information to be</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.190" end="01:58:11.580" style="s2">garnered now on YouTube and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.870" end="01:58:13.170" style="s2">really going to explode over the next 10</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.580" end="01:58:14.730" style="s2">years and I mean one of the things I</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.170" end="01:58:16.590" style="s2">want to work on probably over the next</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.730" end="01:58:18.390" style="s2">ten years is to set up a humanities</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.590" end="01:58:20.280" style="s2">University online and what I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.390" end="01:58:22.830" style="s2">to work I already have some programs</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.280" end="01:58:24.570" style="s2">online they&#39;re called self authoring</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.830" end="01:58:27.240" style="s2">programs and they help people write and</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.570" end="01:58:29.550" style="s2">partly we designed them to help people</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.240" end="01:58:30.990" style="s2">learn to write as well as to help them</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.550" end="01:58:32.490" style="s2">write about themselves so the self</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.990" end="01:58:34.260" style="s2">authoring programs help people write an</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.490" end="01:58:36.330" style="s2">autobiography and analyze their</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.260" end="01:58:38.490" style="s2">personality faults and virtues and lay</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.330" end="01:58:40.830" style="s2">out a future for themselves and when</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.490" end="01:58:42.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve had students do that do the Future</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.830" end="01:58:46.710" style="s2">authoring program it&#39;s so cool what</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.360" end="01:58:48.090" style="s2">happened was that there the probability</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.710" end="01:58:50.100" style="s2">that they would stay in school went up</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.090" end="01:58:52.350" style="s2">by about thirty percent but something</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.100" end="01:58:55.620" style="s2">even cooler happened it worked best for</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.350" end="01:58:57.270" style="s2">the worst-performing students so we did</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.620" end="01:58:59.970" style="s2">a lot of it in Holland at a business</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.270" end="01:59:01.890" style="s2">school called Erasmus there&#39;s a School</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.970" end="01:59:03.900" style="s2">of Management Waterman Rotterdam School</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.890" end="01:59:05.970" style="s2">of Management at Erasmus University and</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.900" end="01:59:07.050" style="s2">we run several thinking about 10,000</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.970" end="01:59:09.060" style="s2">people through the future authoring</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.050" end="01:59:10.740" style="s2">program now and what happened if you</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.060" end="01:59:12.780" style="s2">looked at the academic performance of</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.740" end="01:59:15.540" style="s2">the students the Dutch women the native</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.780" end="01:59:18.480" style="s2">Dutch women were at the pinnacle and</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.540" end="01:59:20.250" style="s2">then it was the Dutch men below them now</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.480" end="01:59:21.210" style="s2">the women were in a minority and they</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.250" end="01:59:22.920" style="s2">were probably a little more highly</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.210" end="01:59:24.540" style="s2">selected right so maybe not accounted</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.920" end="01:59:26.340" style="s2">for the performance gap and then</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.540" end="01:59:28.440" style="s2">underneath that there was female</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.340" end="01:59:29.970" style="s2">non-western ethnic minority immigrants</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.440" end="01:59:32.130" style="s2">and then below that were male</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.970" end="01:59:33.900" style="s2">non-western ethnic minority immigrants</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.130" end="01:59:36.120" style="s2">and there was a massive gap between the</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.900" end="01:59:38.010" style="s2">Dutch women and the male non-western</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.120" end="01:59:40.260" style="s2">minority immigrants like a performance</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.010" end="01:59:43.380" style="s2">gap of about 80 percent a massive gap</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.260" end="01:59:45.330" style="s2">within two years after writing the</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.380" end="01:59:47.370" style="s2">future authoring program the male</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.330" end="01:59:50.310" style="s2">non-ethnic Western minority students</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.370" end="01:59:51.540" style="s2">passed the Dutch students yeah and some</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.310" end="01:59:53.070" style="s2">of them didn&#39;t even remember that they</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.540" end="01:59:55.620" style="s2">had done the future authoring exercise</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.070" end="01:59:58.680" style="s2">and we replicated that at Mohawk College</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.620" end="02:00:00.480" style="s2">just a while back same thing the young</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.680" end="02:00:02.460" style="s2">men who went to Mohawk College they did</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.480" end="02:00:04.140" style="s2">this exercise in the summer just before</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.460" end="02:00:05.790" style="s2">they went to college they only took</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.140" end="02:00:07.500" style="s2">about an hour to write out their future</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.790" end="02:00:09.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not that long to think about your</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.500" end="02:00:12.780" style="s2">whole future and what happened was that</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.570" end="02:00:15.000" style="s2">the young men who had the worst grades</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.780" end="02:00:18.030" style="s2">in school who were in non career</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.000" end="02:00:21.240" style="s2">oriented trajectories had a retention</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.030" end="02:00:22.860" style="s2">improvement of about 40 percent so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.240" end="02:00:25.170" style="s2">so that was just like we were just</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.860" end="02:00:26.610" style="s2">thrilled about that so so the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.170" end="02:00:28.110" style="s2">when you all of this story apart from</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.610" end="02:00:31.560" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s vaguely interesting</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.110" end="02:00:33.510" style="s2">is that we are experimenting with</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.560" end="02:00:35.640" style="s2">technologies to teach people how to</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.510" end="02:00:37.260" style="s2">write now normally the way you&#39;re taught</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.640" end="02:00:39.150" style="s2">how to write is by having someone edit</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.260" end="02:00:41.580" style="s2">your writing but that&#39;s prohibitively</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.150" end="02:00:43.080" style="s2">expensive I don&#39;t think it can be</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.580" end="02:00:45.630" style="s2">transformed in something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.080" end="02:00:47.280" style="s2">available on a mass basis and so what</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.630" end="02:00:48.960" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do is to break down the</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.280" end="02:00:50.670" style="s2">process of writing into its requisite</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.960" end="02:00:52.020" style="s2">step so that&#39;s kind of what behavioral</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.670" end="02:00:53.820" style="s2">psychologists do we&#39;ve done that already</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.020" end="02:00:57.210" style="s2">a bit with these in with this essay</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.820" end="02:00:58.890" style="s2">writing format and then - so to teach</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.210" end="02:01:00.840" style="s2">people what the mechanics of writing</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.890" end="02:01:03.210" style="s2">actually are and then maybe to try to</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.840" end="02:01:04.949" style="s2">figure out how to crowdsource editing so</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.210" end="02:01:07.050" style="s2">that many many people can participate in</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.949" end="02:01:08.969" style="s2">the process but we&#39;d like to set up an</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.050" end="02:01:11.820" style="s2">online humanities University over the</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.969" end="02:01:13.020" style="s2">next 10 years and since the universities</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.820" end="02:01:14.640" style="s2">have abandoned their intellectual</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.020" end="02:01:16.290" style="s2">property there&#39;s no reason not to just</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.640" end="02:01:24.570" style="s2">move in and take it as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.290" end="02:01:27.540" style="s2">so that&#39;s the plan ok ok well thank you</p>
