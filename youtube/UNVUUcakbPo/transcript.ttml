<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">and it would be quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:27.439" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">i had a previous podcast with</p>

<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">i would point up to that episode it may</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">well come up in the conversation today</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">but the focus today</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">is going to be on currencies more</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:51.040" style="s2">generally so let&#39;s start with exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.040" end="00:01:54.079" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about currencies in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">the most general</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.079" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">sense i mean as general as you can make</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">it how would we define</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">currency either one of you feel free to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">take that question</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">well i i know i have a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:08.080" style="s2">where i where i&#39;m trying to let me just</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.080" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">off by saying we use the word currency</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">and money rather interchangeably in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">english</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:19.599" style="s2">and i don&#39;t money to me is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">a particular type of currency it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.599" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">medium of exchange currency i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">to reclaim the word currency</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:29.599" style="s2">more in in resonance with its original</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:30.560" style="s2">roots from the latin query to run to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">right like electrical currents and river</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">currents and and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s a mnemonic that i try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">people to remember when i use the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">currency think of it like</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">currents dash c like c</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">with your eyes the ability to see flows</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">currents so my very specific definition</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">is that a currency is a formal shared</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">symbol system that we use</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">to shape enable and measure flows or</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">currents</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">and you can see how money is a type of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">symbol system</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">that we use to shape enable and flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">exchanges of goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">right but there&#39;s many other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">flows that money isn&#39;t very good at</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">right like uh sharing caring trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">those kinds of things and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">understand the word currency in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">broader</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">context and yet a formalized context</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">it gives you access to shaping these</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">flows very powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">very interesting fernanda do you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">something to add to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">indeed well as arthur said he has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">using that definition of currencies for</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">a long long time</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">and been with him working for decades</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">the part that got me into adopting that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">definition but not only adopting but</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">that actually gave me</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">more tools to think about systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">because when i see</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">i started to see flows and i started to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">see currencies</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">everywhere so it&#39;s like a little switch</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">and sometimes uh we call it like the red</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">pill versus the blue pill</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">moment and once you have it and once you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">get it</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">you start seeing life i mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">and if you sit in or with how living</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">systems work</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">that they work because of the flows and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">among the objects then it makes total</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">sense to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">see current seas</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">to track currents that would be my</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">two bytes on that jim well very good</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">i will confess when i tend to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">currency i use it more abstractly than</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">the average person in the street but</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">considerably</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">less broadly than y&#39;all do my definition</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">i call it signaling systems for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">coordination of production</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">investment and consumption which allows</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">us to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">pretty far afield but still keeps us in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">at least approximately the monetary</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">domain</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">so many of my questions and examples are</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">more likely to come from that space but</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">i would encourage you guys to take it as</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.720" style="s2">general as you would care to because</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">i think both myself and our audience</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">would love to learn about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">broader perspective and i do think</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">that&#39;s very important whenever i talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">currencies one of the first things i</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">a audience is that unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">particularly in places like the united</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">states people have reified the concept</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">money and you know as i like to say the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">first job is to convince people that</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">a fairly major change in 1971</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">as late in the day 1971 where we finally</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">went off the gold standard and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">one could argue that the innovations</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">because everybody&#39;s pretty familiar with</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">right so a college degree is a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">that you&#39;ve attained a certain level of</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">good to have somebody that has been</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">it&#39;s very useful to have that kind of</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the only currency right</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">also use credits for example because you</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">get the degree by getting you know</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">that and 15 credits of the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">credits are just a unit of account</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">currency counting your course hours</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">but the credits only count if you get a</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">are a performance metric currency</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">but these are other currencies that</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">yeah and and then sort of your balance</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.759" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">sheet in that story is is your</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">transcript</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">right it shows you the status it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">of like the scoreboard of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">where you are in acquiring the stacks of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">credits you need and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:27.919" style="s2">the grades that you&#39;ve gotten and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">divide up power</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.919" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">in that space by who issues which</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">currencies professors issue the grades</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">departments issue the credits</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">the university issues the degree so do</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">you get what i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">this is a thing that shapes the flow</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">millions</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">of people&#39;s participation in education</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">yeah it would certainly fall into my</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">broader bucket of coordination of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">production investment and consumption</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s around the production of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">and then later it&#39;s used to shape job</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">opportunities in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">the areas of work which then leads to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">consumption etc so i can see how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">falls even into my somewhat narrower</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">than your very broad definition though i</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">would point out</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">this is another subdivision i discovered</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">and i believe you also use this</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">distinction which is a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">transactional type currencies like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">money systems and static ones like or</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">relatively static ones that are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">transactional like reputation systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">distinction to make because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">for instance you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">spend your college credits right in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">that would be some form of fraud if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">you know manage to transfer your college</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">credits to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">that would not be the purpose for this</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">particular kind of social signal so</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">is it worth distinguishing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:47.839" style="s2">dimension most definitely</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">a good reputation currency should not be</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.839" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">able to be transferred i</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">have a blog post actually about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">that reputation and exchange are</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">dimensions of design in a currency right</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">and and when people make reputation</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">currencies that can be traded</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">they&#39;re almost always really crappy</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">if you can buy reputation or if you lose</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:13.600" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually leveraging it</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s not that you didn&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.600" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">work that was reputed it&#39;s not that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t acquire the learning</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">right when you get into you use your</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">high school degree to get into college</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">they don&#39;t own your high school degree</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">right so the reputation</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">still needs to remain for it to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">integrity still needs to remain with</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">but the credits are an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">hybrid right because credits can be</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.440" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">and part of what you&#39;re trying to look</p>

<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">well where the will the work that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">already done</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">transfer in and count toward work toward</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">a degree in this other university</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">now they don&#39;t transfer to another</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">person right but so there there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">there are always rules in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">transactional dimension</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">that place constraints and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">they just can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">reassigned to another person but</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:16.959" style="s2">sometimes they can still be</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">accepted by another organization in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.959" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">accounting i&#39;m going to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.760" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">nerdy here i&#39;m going to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">that moving you know the transfer of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">credits is actually more like</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">it&#39;s something different because it</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually disappear from the home</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">institution either so let&#39;s i move my</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">credits from you know arizona state to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">arizona university i actually have</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">credits at both places in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">probably more like some kind of foreign</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">transaction where somehow my arizona</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">state credits</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">turn into arizona credits but they still</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:50.000" style="s2">remain arizona state credits as well so</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">interesting and slippery about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">particular example</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">well for me if we follow the track of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">education and currencies</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">what i&#39;m interested about i mean i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">self-instructed learner</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">since forever and i raised a girl</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">that was on and off from school during</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">her</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:15.760" style="s2">whole life she&#39;s 19 now but at for 13</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.360" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">she opened her first maker space and she</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">figured out</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">that the slower learners were those kids</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">that were coming out of school</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">and then she started to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">am i going to do this without</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">without having the credits from school i</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">really don&#39;t want to go to school</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">but how can i prove all that i know</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:35.760" style="s2">right she has studied about</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">finances and learning about marketing</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.760" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">and she has learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">make a startup and how to raise funds</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">and how to do crowdfunding and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">by the time if she would want to study</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:45.279" style="s2">business by the time that she would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.279" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">interested in something that she would</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">passionate about learning it would take</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">a long time</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">for other students to catch up so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">are the currencies of the future that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">will show</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">us when someone has gone through a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">certain flow of skill education</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">performance</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">knowledge you know coordination with</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">others collective intelligence i mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">you name it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">that will help us and enable us to move</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">and evolve what we know now as the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">educational system or the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">of showing that we know because right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">now it&#39;s like if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">universities were the bank and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">the ones like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">issue the currency and if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">the currency</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a phd you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">a job but the phd person will always be</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">regarded as different than the one that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and i believe that my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">except when i already had sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:47.839" style="s2">reputation nobody really cared</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">interesting yeah i&#39;ve certainly played</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.839" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">that game having been a person engaged</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">in the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">without a phd you definitely have to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">quite a bit further down the road to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">prove to people that you&#39;re able to play</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">the game at their level</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">and at least in that domain i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">really aware of an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">signaling system other than just</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">demonstrating it by doing the work and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">being able to hang with the big dogs</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">but certainly that would seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">very significant opportunity there you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">know you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">300 000 to get a four-year university</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">degree from an elite university</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">most of the interesting work seems to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">show that the actual amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">things learned in undergraduate</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">university in the united states at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">is relatively</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">little in fact i had very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">guest jason brennan</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">on the show back in december i think in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">his new book</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">cracks in the ivory tower he makes a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">strong argument that most of what goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">on in universities is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">signaling as well as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">substance you know the students</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">cynically</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:50.000" style="s2">take the easiest courses for the highest</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">grades the professors</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.000" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">modify their teaching to get high</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">student evaluations</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">the administration is always interested</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">in more administration and more tuition</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">so you know the university game itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">is all caught up in signaling</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">but it presumably opens an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">to do exactly what you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">about with your daughter</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">fernanda a way for her to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:14.639" style="s2">demonstrate in a transferable way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">the interesting part that gets us back</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.639" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">into currency design</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s more or less fungible</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">that you can prove</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">that this person is sort of equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">to that person</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">through some other mechanism than</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.839" style="s2">spending three hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">and four years of your life on</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.839" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">relatively unproductive work</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s an area there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">a lot of interesting things going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">thinking about you know things that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">actually happening in that space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">very light</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">but linkedin has you know has their</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">endorsements</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">thing which is kind of a weak version of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">that where you know oh this person&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">good leader or this person&#39;s good at</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">project management etc and your contacts</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">on linkedin endorse you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">and sometimes i&#39;ll write a little word</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">or two about you and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">i suppose that&#39;s mildly interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know to what degree employers</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">use such things but there certainly</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">would appear to be some real</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">opportunities to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">make those signals you know more more</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">truly meaningful where you actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">could use them to get a job</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know i mean it depends</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">right if you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">something that like a portfolio of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:21.839" style="s2">things have you done</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">and reputation with people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.839" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">then you start getting in your way in</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:27.199" style="s2">what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">can do and what is possible but that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.199" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">probably it&#39;s another variant another</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">path that we can take in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">conversation so i don&#39;t want to deviate</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">it from our currency topic</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">that is for sure something that we want</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">on what possible designs are there</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:48.320" style="s2">in the future so that the the issuance</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">of knowledge doesn&#39;t belong to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.320" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">universities alone</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">yeah one example from history is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">guild systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">where essentially the guilds took on</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">responsibility if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">silversmith for instance you&#39;d start as</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">a junior apprentice then you&#39;d be an</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">apprentice then a senior apprentice and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">a journeyman and then a master</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">and those actually had very significant</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">meaning that were transferable across</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">at least western european medieval</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">so if you were a master silversmith in</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">france it meant about the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">in germany and you could move to germany</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">and get a job as a master silversmith</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s at least one example where</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">that can become transferable</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably where we get back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.240" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">our discussion of currencies</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:33.919" style="s2">where the signal isn&#39;t idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">like a portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.919" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">but rather has relatively simple surface</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">attributes</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">you know for instance a ranking system</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.160" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">within a guild</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">if that makes any sense arthur i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">looks like you have something to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting because like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">transfer of credits</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t a standard double entry accounting</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">transaction right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">the the source isn&#39;t debited for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">credits and that&#39;s generally true of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">reputation currencies</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">the source isn&#39;t debited for having</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">reputed something so you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">about those linkedin</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:08.559" style="s2">endorsements where you know i say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">good at podcasting or you&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.559" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">science or you&#39;re good at you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">systems thinking or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">the thing is right i&#39;m not being debited</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">anything for saying those things but</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">there&#39;s some interesting language that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">we use sometimes around this that i</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">think gives us a clue as to really what</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">is going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">where we talk about lending credibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">to something so like i&#39;m not actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">debited for it but if you have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">system working right</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">i should be on the line in some way if</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">this is a good person hire them</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">and they&#39;re not then that should come</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">back to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">on me in terms of my reliability of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not like i&#39;m being debited</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">if there&#39;s nothing that i&#39;m on the hook</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">for then you have a pretty wishy-washy</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">reputation currency</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">because my reputation for being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">discern</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">somebody&#39;s character or somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">skills and you know and be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">a good recommendation</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">at the very least should be on the line</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:15.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">so we talk about a signaling system</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.679" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">there needs to be a back channel</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">essentially that all right i employer</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">relied upon your signal turned out your</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">signal was bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">there needs to be a way to send a return</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">message back to your reputation that</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">at least with respect to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">transaction your signaling was of low</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">something like that that&#39;s right and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">boost it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">if it was of high quality so people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">are really great at making</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">recommendations and placements</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">they get listened to more and people</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">that are not so great about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:48.000" style="s2">get less than two less yeah it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">great to hook that into</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.000" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">a rating system on social media right</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">because unfortunately a like is a like</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">as a like or a retweet is a retweet is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">retweet</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">and if one could somehow have feedback</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">on the quality of those recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">and filter them and down regulate them</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">or up regulate them based on your</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">previous</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">experience with that particular signaler</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">that would be quite useful</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">yes indeed it also reminds me in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">currency</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">the mutual credit i implemented in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">mexico it is called leanness and still</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">and one of the ways in which people get</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">into the circle</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">of the mutual credit of olines uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">is through someone&#39;s recommending you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">actually the only way</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">and that person has to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">for your learning</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">and has is kind of some sort of body</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">where they go with you until they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">sure that you can walk on your own you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">know the system you know how to transact</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">you actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty intense when you do it into</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">mutual credit because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">money it&#39;s community currency so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">don&#39;t do what you can do with money</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">and people we are so used to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">just transacting with money that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.360" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">forget about all</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">other dimensions of value that can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">shared within a community context</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">and then we need to learn those things</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">as well so the body system works that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:15.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s really useful sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">would have somebody that would say hey</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">i&#39;m new to town</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">and i heard about rolliness and i would</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">like to be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">and then you will allow them to have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">credit limit until they prove their</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">reputation</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">by the number of transactions they have</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">other number of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">happy people with a way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">provided value to the community and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">but i would always have wanted to see a</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">system that would integrate</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">that reputation currency with a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">credit even at time banks</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">so you can see different dimensions as</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">arthur was saying because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">linear or flat like you can have two</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">carpenters that are awesome</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">and joe is fast and he&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">but his things don&#39;t tend to last many</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">while you know joe he&#39;s very slow but</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">his quality is amazing and he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">likely</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">that his furniture would last for</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">and then both are not good or bad it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">just about what is the choices that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">want to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">and be able to make those dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">visible</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">so that people can make informed</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">when you want they want to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">a transaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">based on what your reputation looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">but most of the systems are pretty flat</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">so you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">see dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">yeah i guess the question is does it</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">cognitively map to what humans are</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">actually capable of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">and it is always important i point this</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">out to people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">like myself enjoy designing these</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">systems is that 50</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">of your audience if this is a global</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">system will have an iq less than a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">hundred</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s important to design a system</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">that&#39;s actually tractable with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">actual human cognitive ability</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">you&#39;ll find on the ground yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">interesting about that though is i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">people have more capacity in this domain</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">than we give them credit for</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">at least in the domain of what i call</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">currencies i think we navigate</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">different we re we navigate you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">dozens of different currencies a day</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">and understand by context which set of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">rules we&#39;re operating in</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">so that you don&#39;t try to use your grade</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">on your math test to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">pay for gas at the gas station you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">use a postage stamp for</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:35.840" style="s2">or your or your bus pass or your you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">know like there&#39;s lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">kinds of currencies</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">that make sense in certain contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">but i think what you&#39;re pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">is that the currency has to map well</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">to the social frame to the social</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">expectations if it doesn&#39;t map well</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to cause too much</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">cognitive overhead</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">of trying to like have people remap ah</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">very well said i like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">yeah but there&#39;s different social</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">contexts in which there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">social frames</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">right so when when i go across the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">street</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">and you know to my neighbor brian and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">say hey</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">can i borrow a handful of nails i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">working on this project and i&#39;ve run out</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">of nails i just want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">finish this project</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">man he would like root through his</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">basement for an hour to find me that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">handful of nails or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">excited to help out and and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">want me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">hand him a couple bucks for the nails he</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">gives me he doesn&#39;t want me to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">you know next week when i&#39;ve gone to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">to the hardware store and to return some</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">nails to him or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not an exchange type of social</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">contract</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">what it is in this case is a is</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">neighbors investing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">in living in a neighborhood where</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">neighbors treat each other well</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">right and so if you make your reputation</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">type of currencies</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">map to that frame then they have low</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">cognitive overhead</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">but if you start trying to make them</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">really complicated with a bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">rules you&#39;re trying to push in there</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">then they get complex and they they take</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">a lot of cognitive overhead</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a beautiful distinction</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">very well said in fact i act i grew up</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">in one of those neighborhoods of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">call it upper working class lower middle</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">class you know plumbers electricians</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">carpenters</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:20.400" style="s2">cops what have you and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">neighborhood basically ran on a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">loose form of reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">i never heard of anybody ever actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">calling a plumber somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">in the neighborhood there was always</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">someone that knew enough about soldering</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">and piping and what have you to be able</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">instruct you on how to fix your sink or</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">unstuck a toilet etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">and they&#39;d expect you to reciprocate but</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">not one-on-one and not necessarily now</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">was kind of a very loose unstructured</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">of reciprocity credit that built up over</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if that actually falls</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">into our definition of currency but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">certainly falls into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">signaling system domain yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:55.679" style="s2">really interesting about it though is i</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">think you have to be careful about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">reciprocity piece because it lets you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">hold on to that money concept where</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">there is a little bit of a tit for tat</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">going on because what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:10.480" style="s2">interesting is if i go borrow that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">handful of nails from brian and he finds</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.480" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">it pretty easily and i thank him and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">grateful and you know that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">what what&#39;s actually been invested in is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">and it actually increases my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">go back to him next week and say</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">hey man can i borrow your lawn mower i</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">can&#39;t get mine to start</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">or whatever right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">now i owe</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">him an equal measure it&#39;s that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">investing in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">neighborliness and both of our abilities</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">to use that neighborliness go up</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">when we do that yeah that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">because that gets around the classic</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">western</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">point of view failure of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">objects but not seeing the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">so in this case if you argue that what</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is investing in the line</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">that connects the two</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">objects rather than either of the two</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">objects that provides a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">framing for thinking about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">yes and it also points to another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">constantly emphasize about not wanting</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">to track</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">absolutely everything because then i</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:15.440" style="s2">mean if you wanted to track that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:17.279" style="s2">then oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.440" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">i&#39;ll go to our inter our neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">interface and i&#39;ll put you</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:25.360" style="s2">two neighborly points and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">gain trust and you start measuring</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">everything it just becomes</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">mechanic and artificial</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">it loses its beauty</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:38.640" style="s2">especially if you track it using</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">scarcity-based accounting</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.640" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">i think this is one of the binds that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">time banks get into because time banks</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">are really kind of magical in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">because they what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">have neighbors be able to find each</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">other for doing these kind of neighborly</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">services or exchanges like the plumber</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">you described or or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">you know so i can go</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">mow somebody&#39;s lawn and i get time</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">dollars for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">and they get debited time dollars for</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">that and then they can whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">you know maybe i&#39;m doing it for an older</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">woman in the neighborhood and she bakes</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">pies that go to somebody else and she</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">gets earns time dollars for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">but then what happens is when i start</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">having a relationship with her</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">because i&#39;ve mowed her lawn a few times</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">and she invites me in and serves me</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">lemonade or whatever then we start</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">having our own</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">relationship that we&#39;re investing in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">to account for it like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">she&#39;s getting debited time dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">i&#39;m being credited time dollars</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">no longer feels right for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">it no longer it&#39;s again that mapping the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:45.919" style="s2">social frame</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">right it now now i it&#39;s like when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">when you go over to a friend&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">dinner you don&#39;t leave a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">a 20 bill sitting on the plate right</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">when you when you get invited over to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">friend&#39;s house</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">for dinner that&#39;d be kind of rude right</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">because they&#39;re not asking you to pay</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">it was a social occasion and as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">start building that social relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">you still stick with scarcity-based</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">accounting it puts us</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">back into really a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">dehumanized frame</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">an anti-social frame because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">frame that money operates in yes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">so one of the things that struck me uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">when working with the time banks i</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">worked with the south oregon time banks</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">quite a little time time when i first</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">arrived to ashland</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">and um the scarcity mindset</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">operates even when people are playing</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:36.559" style="s2">with abundant currencies</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">so for example when you get into time</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.559" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">banks you you work for someone you</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">provide some value and you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">time and then it gets accounted to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">but somehow there was the perception</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">that time points had to be given to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">new person so that they would</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">feel abundance and it doesn&#39;t work that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">i feel that one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">need to be shifting is our mindsets of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">into creating currencies that are not uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">scarce by design but that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">pretty dependent because the value that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">the community can provide and that i can</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">provide</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">uh can be infinite can be full of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.039" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">of of potential and then the time bank</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:23.919" style="s2">people i was trying for them to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">that it was not necessary to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.919" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">and but that also they didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">stick with one hour is one hour</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">of my time regardless if i am a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">surgeon and you&#39;re you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">cleaning my dishes</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">and and it was not possible to get out</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">of there because it turns to be an</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:46.159" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">more than trying to find a way which we</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.159" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">can create more and more flows</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">uh for everyone i like that yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">let&#39;s dig into this topic some because</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">this intersects a couple of different</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">things which i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">are quite interesting we actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:06.279" style="s2">time bank in our little town in virginia</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">stanton virginia called our hour</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.279" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">economy.org and it is the classic</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">time bank or an hour equals an hour by</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">neurosurgeon same as cutting the grass</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">and we have run into just the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">about that people have a scarcity or</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a protestant work ethic or</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">it&#39;s good to have a positive balance</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">right that going</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">negative is somehow disreputable</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">and so if we have a community i probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">you know psychological or sociological</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">reasons i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">understand the our economy system is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">probably over populated with these</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">diligent reliable people all who</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">want positive balances and as we know in</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">a mutual credit system everybody can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">have a positive balance</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">so we have talked about all these same</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">things how much startup</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">credit should people get right i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">that we finally decided on three hours</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">didn&#39;t really help any at all because as</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">you know if you have a mindset that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">all have to be positive you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">eventually deplete the credit</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">and things will stop working you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about things like</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">adding a demurrage charge that&#39;s one i</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">still like heavy make it 10</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">a month right if you accumulate hours</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">they go away and get redistributed per</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">capita</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">again the community was not willing to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">go that route again because of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">something about hoarding that&#39;s good my</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">positive signal i was a good person</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">i have a positive balance and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">if you get away from that perspective it</p>

<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">and you know the whole idea of mutual</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">credit is an area</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">that it could be potentially utterly</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">liberating to</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">i&#39;d love to get your guys thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">you know what if anything can be done is</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">it currency design like demurrage or</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">other things or is it more of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">psychological sociological problem of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">getting people to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">as long as over the long term they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">productive members of society it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">actually a good thing to be negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">because it means</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">that transactions have occurred i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a big question i&#39;m very interested</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">in your answers</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">well for me it has a lot to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">frame that i was talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">where if you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">this sort of neighborly exchange system</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">you use scarcity-based accounting as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">frame even if it&#39;s mutual credit</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:37.519" style="s2">and could not be scarce</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">but the problem is you have a balance</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">and the way people</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">have been trained by money which</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">occupies most of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:46.480" style="s2">our imagination when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">currency right because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.480" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">become we&#39;ve been so buried by our</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">exposure to money right that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">that other things pale in comparison</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">sort of this shame of having a negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">balance or a fear of having a negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">but if you for example set up a a time</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">bank that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">a bank but it was more like you set up</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">the accounting to be in more like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">community service</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">transcript frame think of it more like</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">the educational currencies</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">where you are counting your hours</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">invested in different types of service</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">to the community</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">right nobody has a negative balance they</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">just have</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">different periods of time over which</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">they&#39;ve invested in the community</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">right and you can see somebody&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">sheet if you will as as a record</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">of their service not as a balance</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">necessarily and i know you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">the places that time banks actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">have one of the niches that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">tried to serve is also like people</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">coming back</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">and reintegrating into communities from</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:51.839" style="s2">prison</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">because it&#39;s very hard for them to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">jobs</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">but i think something like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">community service</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">transcript would be much more helpful in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">having them</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">get job placement where they can see</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">they&#39;re an active contributing</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">citizen that has maybe also a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">testimonials that go along with it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">then a time bank balance oh look i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">earned 50 time dollars aren&#39;t i great</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">i like this yeah yeah because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">open-ended yeah it&#39;s all positive i like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">that that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">does the transaction still work so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">you know an elderly person who could no</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">longer shovel their snow</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">on our time bank you&#39;d put up a request</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for someone to shovel my</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">snow</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">and somebody who felt capable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">that would basically take up that offer</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">and would get no debits or credits but</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">rather would add</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">that to their resume shall we say well i</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">guess that works</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s true you can have kind of the flip</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:50.079" style="s2">side of that sheet as well which shows</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">the services i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve taken i&#39;ve accepted right which</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">gives you a sense of is this person in</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">right like or what kinds of needs they</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">or or things like that right so you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">have both things be visible</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">i like that a lot because it actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">serves the similar psychological purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">of dissuading free riders while at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">not being rigorously transaction</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">kind of sucking at her protestant work</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.079" style="s2">ethic towards running up a positive</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.079" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">that&#39;s quite interesting because both</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">are positive in some sense right</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">either side of the transaction could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">thought of as a positive thing under</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">that scenario</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">i think might be worth trying let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">a little further</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">again this is an area i&#39;m so interested</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">in but it&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">we all know from looking at the history</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">of people trying it it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">get it to work</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">at a large scale our mutual credit</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">you know there&#39;s lots of these little</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">let systems around there&#39;s the weir</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">but again they only seem to work in very</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">special social contexts</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">maybe one of you could describe what a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">mutual</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">credit system is and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">why haven&#39;t these things taken off they</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:08.640" style="s2">seem like the magic universal solvent</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">to the problem of money but they just</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.640" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">yet haven&#39;t made it</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">yeah um for me i&#39;m i think i&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">bit more precise about my definition of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">mutual credit than some people</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:21.040" style="s2">for me it actually just has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">the form of issuance</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.040" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">it means that for every credit created</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">there is an offsetting debit</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">that that money is always created</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">through the act of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">an offsetting debit and credit and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">therefore what that really means is</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">all the positive balances always equal</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">the negative balances</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">and so the net money supply is always</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">so this is not how i&#39;m not used to how</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking of money supply</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">right like if you look at the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">cryptocurrency stuff and all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">you know the coin market cap they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">looking at the supply</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">as one of the main things and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">always trying to keep an eye on if the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">supply chains then</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">then this could have value impacts and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">all that kind of stuff well the supply</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">never changes in a mutual credit</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">currency</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">and what changes is the active supply</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">how far people are into the positive or</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">and so the game in mutual credit as far</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">as i&#39;m concerned is</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">the the management of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">credit limit patterns and formulas now</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">most people like you mentioned time</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">banks and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">let&#39;s systems and those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">most people aren&#39;t very creative about</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a vanilla um format</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">for mutual credit where it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">is no formal credit limit and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">can go up and down equally and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">all that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">and uh as far as i&#39;m concerned that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not very creative and those</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">things do have a limit on scale and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:52.079" style="s2">application that often what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.079" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">is tailor it for a particular use or</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:38:59.680" style="s2">where you can have different for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">classes of users</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.680" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">that may have different types of credit</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">limits or different algorithms for</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">determining their credit limits</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">and the beauty of this is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">have a mutual credit currency</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">that the supply can be encoded both to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:16.240" style="s2">expand when the market needs it when</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">there&#39;s demand for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.240" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">and to contract when there&#39;s less demand</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">and fiat currencies suck at contracting</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">supply</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">they only know how to devalue when</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">there&#39;s less demand for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not quite true let me</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">probe on this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">because if you think about it using your</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">definition our current</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">monetary system is substantially mutual</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">credit which</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">seems to me means there may be there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:44.720" style="s2">problem with the definition</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">because as we know more than 90 percent</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.720" end="00:39:48.800" style="s2">of the money in circulation</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">is issued by commercial banks under the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.800" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">fractional reserve</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">banking regulations or their equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">in savings and loans or</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">credit unions etc and the money does not</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">you know long-term life it only exists</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">as long as the loan is outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">when the loan is repaid that money</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">literally disappears</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">now it turns out that because banks are</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">in the business of lending money</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">most of the time they recycle the money</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">back out with new loans as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">they possibly can because the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">created money is a lack of profit</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">however one of the things that actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">drives recessions</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">is when the rate at which new loans are</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">put out</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:30.079" style="s2">falls the money supply at least the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">locally available money supply actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">falls as well so</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">our traditional commercial bank driven</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">fractional reserve banking system has a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">lot of those same</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">attributes so it makes me a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">skeptical of that definition</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">not exactly here&#39;s the thing when a bank</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">gives me a mortgage right and i they</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">just created a half a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">or rather they just gave me a check for</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">a half a million dollars toward paying</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">off the previous people</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">right they did not deduct that half a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">from an account no that&#39;s the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">you know they love that right buy money</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">out of thin air but they did give you a</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">debit</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">you now have a and actually in their</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">vocabulary the other way around the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">money is a liability to them</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">but the mortgage is an asset and the two</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">offset each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">exactly but then what they just did was</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">doubly create two assets</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">they created an asset on their books</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">which is the mortgage of the money that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">i own owed them</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">and they created 500 000 check that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">wrote out to the previous owners to pay</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">off their mortgage or specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">previous owner&#39;s bank to pay off the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">mortgage right</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">and uh so you don&#39;t have the money being</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">created with an</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">offsetting debit and credit let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">be clear about that from the outset</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">right so it&#39;s being created from nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">and then the way that they they game</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">this system is the order of repayment</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">you know like when use your initial</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">payments on your</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">mortgage you&#39;ve got 99 of it being</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">applied to interest</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">and very little of it impacting</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:03.520" style="s2">principle over time that that switches</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">right so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.520" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">on the on the tail end when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">finally paying off your home 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">later or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:11.119" style="s2">it&#39;s almost 100 percent of your payment</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">plan applying to principal</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.119" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">well the reason for that is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">repaying principal</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">that money technically going back out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">circulation</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">exactly that was my point the money</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">actually disappears when you repay</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">principal</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">so how&#39;s that different than mutual</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">credit because in mutual credit what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">do is</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">if you create an algorithm for</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">somebody&#39;s credit limit to be tied to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">their productive capacity their their</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">track record rather let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">so in the case of holofuel it is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">correlated to the past few months of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">hosting of hosts</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.400" end="00:42:47.839" style="s2">we take that as a strong indicator</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">of the next few months of hosting of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.839" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">likelihood for them to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">repay if they go into the negative right</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">and so your credit limit expands as you</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">provide value</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">and as there&#39;s demand for that value and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">as that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">as that demand either decreases or your</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">ability to provide it decreases</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">so does your credit limit now that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve changed your balance because many</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">people may have a credit limit and not</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">go into the negative at all they may</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">still have a positive balance or</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">but your ability to to draw against that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">supply the supply</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">to draw against changes and so even if</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">you had a negative balance extended to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">your full credit</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">but your credit credit limit is now</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">shrinking it means you can&#39;t expand it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:37.119" style="s2">again you can only contract</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">as you take in as you take in for</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.119" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">example the hosting payments</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:42.800" style="s2">they will not be spendable to you</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">because you&#39;re beyond your credit limit</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.800" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">does that make sense yeah i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can tease out the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:51.359" style="s2">difference because there is i can see</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">there&#39;s similarities but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">the big difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">is there is not a interest-bearing</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">liability that&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">in the case of the mutual credit system</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">nobody is collecting</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">interest on the money that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">created</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">yes that&#39;s a big difference but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">actually i don&#39;t want to skip that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">the biggest difference i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">skip over</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">fundamentally fiat currency is encoded</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">for scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">what that means is you always owe more</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:20.480" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">than exists so when i get that half a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.480" end="00:44:24.160" style="s2">million dollar mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">over the course of 30 years i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.160" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">have to pay back like three times that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">amount depending on the interest rate</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">that i got it at right i&#39;m gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:35.920" style="s2">pay back 1.5 million</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">but only a half a million got created</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.920" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">not 1.5 million</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">so how the heck am i supposed to pay</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">back 1.5 million on a loan</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">that only creates a half a million that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">can only</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">happen if i can take it from other</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">people&#39;s principle</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">because only money that exists was</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">created</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">but the money that&#39;s owed is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">principal plus interest so for every</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">dollar created</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">a dollar plus interest is owed so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">whole system is encoded for scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">and also it&#39;s unstable unless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">enough growth</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">right that&#39;s the classic built-in</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">imperative of growth the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">create the money with a magic wand in</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">fractional reserve banking but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:17.359" style="s2">create the money for the interest and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">if the thing doesn&#39;t continue to grow it</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.359" end="00:45:22.720" style="s2">runs out of money and crashes</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">exactly so if we don&#39;t grow the economy</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.720" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">next year to service the interest on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">money we issued this year</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">then we start having massive defaults</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:33.040" style="s2">and foreclosures and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">you know that kind of thing on loans</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.040" end="00:45:36.079" style="s2">yeah so a mutual credit let&#39;s make sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:38.319" style="s2">we make it clear both</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.079" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">to me would be helpful and to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.319" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">audience so in mutual credit</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">i have good credit say for a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">dollars i can create a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">worth of money out of thin air</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">but there&#39;s no offsetting interest</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">generating</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">liability all i&#39;ve done is depleted my</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">credit level i haven&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">built this liability for interest in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.119" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">future is that a fair distinction</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">i i got a little confused in there as to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">which you were talking about because you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">said mutual credit but then it sounded</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">like you were talking about creating it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">out of thin air</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">but you are creating i mean as i</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">understand mutual credit if i have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:13.520" style="s2">thousand dollar credit limit</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">i can literally create a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.520" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">dollars worth of money</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">out of thin air and all i do i deplete</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">all i can do is spend money in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">transaction right</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t get to just write a check i</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">don&#39;t get to create some instrument that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">has its own independent existence</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">i can i can participate in a transaction</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">in which i go into the negative</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">and somebody else goes into the positive</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:38.079" style="s2">so really what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is somebody else is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.079" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">providing</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">value actual real value for</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">the money they&#39;re being credited and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">being debited for receiving that value</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">different than when a bank creates money</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">from nothing</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">where they&#39;re sending this check and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">getting the asset of my mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">right and they therefore technically</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">also get to be the primary owner on my</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">i feel like i want to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">different forms of issuance to really</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.119" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">what it means to have something created</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">by fiat literally created by nothing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">just the authority to say so</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">versus something that&#39;s asset-backed a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">backed currency versus something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">a mutual credit currency</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">there they&#39;re truly different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">issuance and this is i think where</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">people get really confused</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">because they only think about money</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">transactionally</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">not not about the full life cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">issuance</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">to redemption retirement expiration of</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">units well dig in they go go for it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">because i think i&#39;m confused a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">bit now i thought i understood what</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">mutual credit was not an area i have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">lot of expertise in but yeah dig into it</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s make it as clear as we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">make it</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">cool so when you have a backed currency</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:53.680" style="s2">so for example there are some</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">uh local currencies like berkshires or</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.680" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">sometimes some local chambers of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">commerce create some little currencies</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">and stuff where they</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">you you buy local currency units by</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:07.599" style="s2">spending dollars on them right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">then they can only be spent at these</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.599" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">local businesses and the businesses have</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">the ability to cash out</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">for the dollars that are backing the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">local credits</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a backed currency that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">backed in this case</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">by the asset of a dollar now you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">make a currency be backed by electricity</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">by hosting power by</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">by different kinds of things right which</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">is what we do with holofuel it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">we really say that it&#39;s backed by</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">for the hosts lines of credits</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">right um and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">that&#39;s different than when you create</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">something from nothing there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">on deposit you can&#39;t redeem a dollar now</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">that you said there was a big change in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">1971</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">back in back then there was a gold</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.440" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">standard you could technically redeem a</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">dollar for gold</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">you could say that dollars were backed</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">by gold except the issuance of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">wasn&#39;t tightly</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">connected to gold reserve so it was all</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:04.880" style="s2">very very sloppy</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">and it was really a bretton woods scheme</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.880" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">to get the</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">dollar as a universal backing currency</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">so we could kind of tie the whole global</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">economy together and have everybody use</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:15.839" style="s2">dollars as a reserve</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">currency because they knew they could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.839" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">redeemed for gold in an emergency</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">so that that was a a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">weird hybrid where it&#39;s kind of fiat</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">currency issuance</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">with a promise that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">redeem it for something</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">as long as nobody really calls in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">promise we can get away with that for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">while</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">and once they started they had to end</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">the system right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">exactly which is why nixon terminated it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">in 71 right</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s asset backed and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">what we call</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">secured where technically what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:51.599" style="s2">happening in the case of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">mortgage is that the mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.599" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">asset is secured by the house my promise</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">to pay</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">is secured by the house now people think</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">that the 500 000</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">check that the bank handed me was</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">secured by the house or is asset backed</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">but the fact that you can&#39;t go and take</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:08.880" style="s2">those dollars back to the bank and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">redeem it from my house</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.880" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">tells you it&#39;s not actually backed by it</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the loan was secured by it</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">which basically means technically banks</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">own almost all the property</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">in our country not people because we</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">have them all mortgaged</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">and and if the bank calls in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">they they take the property right during</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:33.920" style="s2">coronavirus time there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">thing right where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.920" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">given some flexibility or forgiveness on</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">payments</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">but what happens if we cross a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">where banks start calling in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">all of this stuff right because the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">loans the mortgage was secured by the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">so let me just try again to state them</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">clearly we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">fiat issuance created from nothing</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">we have asset-backed as in the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">currency is redeemable for something we</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">have secured</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">issuance which means that the promise</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">is secured by something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">reclaimed which is not the same as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">token holder being able to redeem it</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a different part of the cycle</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">and then you have you have weird things</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">that flip</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">where is it secured by the issuer or is</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">it secured by the recipient</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">right so in the case of the the bank</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">i&#39;m the recipient of the money and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">securing the loan it&#39;s not that the bank</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">is securing the loan</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">i&#39;m securing the loan but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">always how it works sometimes the issuer</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">is also the the person providing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">security</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">oh sorry there&#39;s one other type of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">currency and that&#39;s a type of currency</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:49.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really get issued i originally</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">called it a metacurrency maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">better to be called</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">a currency constellation but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">actually one that&#39;s computed</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">or derived from other currencies like</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">the dow jones index</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:03.760" style="s2">for example there&#39;s now funds that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">you can buy</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.760" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">and trade on the dow jones index but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">dow jones index</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:13.280" style="s2">is not actually a currency that&#39;s issued</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">it is derived from a series of other</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.280" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">currencies that are issued a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">a bunch of corporate stocks right those</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">are the different types of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">of issuance we didn&#39;t quite get all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:24.640" style="s2">way where we wanted to go though because</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">i did want you to do the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.640" end="00:52:30.079" style="s2">analysis on mutual credit money</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the other form of issuance</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.079" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">it is created only with an offsetting</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:38.079" style="s2">debit and credit</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">right so it can only be done through a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">spending type of transaction there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">special issuing type of transactions you</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">could say that the money is being issued</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">whenever somebody</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">goes into the negative for any portion</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">of their transaction</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">right if i had 20 credits but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">spending 50</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">well 30 just got issued in the process</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">of me spending that 50.</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.440" end="00:53:02.240" style="s2">but the you always have offsetting the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:04.400" style="s2">total supply is always zero</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">which is very much not the way dollars</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">work the total supply is obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">zero then we have in fact we obscure the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">total supply right we have the m1 m2</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">m3 and they stopped publishing the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">larger numbers</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">because they were shameful i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">at that point the amount of derivation</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:26.000" style="s2">the amount of derivative</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">money that we have happening on on top</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.000" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">of the base money</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">issuance yeah i have a little story</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">about that which i like to tell people</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">i might as well tell here yeah which the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">fed stopped publishing</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">m3 in 2006 because it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:43.520" style="s2">seemingly growing at 16 a year</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">and the economist said that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.520" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">and guess what it was actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:51.359" style="s2">in the form</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:53.319" style="s2">of very downstream money creation using</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.359" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">a very strange mechanism called</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.319" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">rehypothecation of</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">collateral where collateral could be</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">used more than once</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">in the insides of the banking system</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very complicated hard to explain</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">exactly how it works</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">and so their money was actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:08.960" style="s2">increasing that rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">and this is as if the physicists had</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.960" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">decided to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">ignore the anomalies detected in the</p>

<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">which seemed to show some strange things</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">about the speed of light if they had</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">just said forget that</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">then we would never have had the</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.520" end="00:54:39.119" style="s2">maybe someone would have looked at this</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">crazy mechanism where</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.119" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">somewhere around six trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">was manufactured in the united states</p>

<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">and when that money suddenly exploded</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:51.359" style="s2">downward disappeared in the two weeks</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.359" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">that was actually the proximate cause of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">what took a medium-sized economic error</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">giving too many loans to to people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">had bad credit and turned it into a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">financial catastrophe it actually had</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:05.680" style="s2">nothing to do with the mortgages</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.680" end="00:55:09.920" style="s2">rather it had to do with the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">effect of the implosion of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.920" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">very exotic m3 type money which actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.559" style="s2">was being created</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">so it gives you a warning about what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.559" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">choose to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">well exactly i mean i think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:24.559" style="s2">a real reason for this though</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.559" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">and i ha i am sometimes hesitant to talk</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">about this i don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">cast as some sort of doom sayer here but</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">the the reason is that when you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:39.760" style="s2">well that will go back to interest that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">you brought up before when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.760" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">fiat currency</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">that has compounding interest right</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">what you end up having is this the money</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.599" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">supply</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">is forced into this compounding</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">exponential curve</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">and the underlying economy is forced to</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:55:59.680" style="s2">attempt to match that curve</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">and the disparity between the economy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.680" end="00:56:05.920" style="s2">ability to match that curve</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">and the actual money supply growing</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.920" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">is the likelihood of collapse</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">essentially right it&#39;s like the the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:17.040" style="s2">showing you how short you&#39;re falling</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">from being able to continue to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.040" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">plane afloat if you will</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">right and it&#39;s like the warning signals</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">are going off</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">that you know that we&#39;ve got the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">line set wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re choosing to mute the warning</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">signal</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">because we&#39;re outstripping the ability</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">for keeping up with that exponential</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">at this point and so it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">to mute the warning signal and have</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">everybody stop panicking</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.640" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">you know is what it seems like like</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the decision that they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">and so the question is now when we turn</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">too many things in the dashboard to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:58.720" style="s2">able to actually see</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and what the gap is</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.720" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">then we get blindsided by its</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:03.760" style="s2">consequences by its effects</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.760" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">flying blind on some of these things now</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve had all these new means to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">paper over the fact that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">financial structure is out of whack you</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">know they keep inventing new</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">goodies right that was the qes first</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">buying any kind of crappy ass asset and</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">holding it on the fed&#39;s books right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2">you keep that game going for a while but</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t think for very long</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">we&#39;ll find out but i want to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">the different types of currency and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">particular the kind of the asset backing</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">and what that really looks like when a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:39.760" style="s2">currency can be asset backed</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">you know there are some well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.760" end="00:57:44.799" style="s2">futures trading for example right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">actually backed by the delivery of uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.799" end="00:57:48.079" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">a container of corn or you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.079" end="00:57:51.760" style="s2">the thing is at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:53.280" style="s2">the period and until that time people</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.760" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">are trading the futures</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.280" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">on it based on the value that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">example of kind of a backed</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">currency but it&#39;s a backed currency</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">optimized for a strange gambling market</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">right on the on the futures betting well</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:07.119" style="s2">it&#39;s actually good for farmers</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:08.799" style="s2">farmers use that very legitimately to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.119" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">lock in the price for their crops</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.799" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">at an appropriate time or they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">black i live in an agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">area and that&#39;s a very important part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">managing your farm is playing the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">futures</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">not playing but using the futures market</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">appropriately to hedge your crop</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">right but and it also i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:27.040" style="s2">original purpose was to give the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">up front liquidity at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.040" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">the growing season when they needed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:32.720" style="s2">be investing the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:34.799" style="s2">so they could basically pre-sell some of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.720" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">the stuff and get the value up front</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.799" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">and then deliver on their product right</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.760" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">so that it provides an</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">essential liquidity also to the farmers</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.480" end="00:58:46.559" style="s2">the problem as has happened with our</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:48.160" style="s2">whole economy</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.559" end="00:58:49.599" style="s2">and the problem with the futures market</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.160" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">and has happened with our whole economy</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.599" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">is actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">the way i think about it is the tail</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">wagging the dog what what&#39;s happened is</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:59:00.400" style="s2">that our whole economy has moved into</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">where you know i i don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.400" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">current number is somewhere around</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">10 years ago it was around 98 and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">it&#39;s probably even higher now with</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">millisecond trading and everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">but where 98 of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:17.599" style="s2">daily volume of dollars transacted is in</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">the speculative economy</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2">not in the productive economy and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">you know there was once a time where you</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">could think of a nation&#39;s currency</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">as being correlated to the productive</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">capacity of that nation</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">and that was how currencies were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">offset with each other or</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:37.920" style="s2">valued relative to each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">know at this point</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.920" end="00:59:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really all gambling markets it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">all speculation</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.760" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">and the same thing has happened in the</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:36.799" style="s2">market and what we&#39;ve been trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.119" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">is create a new class of cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.799" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">that&#39;s resilient against</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:41.440" style="s2">that type of manipulation yeah i like</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">the backed currency idea though of</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">course it has a limitation which it can</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:51.200" style="s2">at least i haven&#39;t seen any proposals</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">and how it works with non-fungible goods</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.200" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">one of the reasons that mortgages are</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:56.559" style="s2">the way they are is that every house is</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">different and nor are they dividable you</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.559" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">can&#39;t go and say i want a hundredth of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:00.640" style="s2">house right</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:02.319" style="s2">you know there&#39;s it&#39;s a specific house</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">in a particular place in a specific</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.319" end="01:02:06.160" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.039" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">etc unlike say electricity or</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.160" end="01:02:10.000" style="s2">hollow fuel processing capacity which</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">one could think at least as</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.000" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">roughly fungible and that you know and</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">approximately fully dividable so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">better fit in some ways for a money</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:22.480" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s true i mean i think there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">some some things</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.480" end="01:02:26.079" style="s2">where i think we can actually also tap</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">into transportation</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.079" end="01:02:29.440" style="s2">and housing but it&#39;s housing a little</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:33.200" style="s2">bit more</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.440" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">a la airbnb than than property ownership</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.200" end="01:02:37.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like bed nights</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">room nights if you will you know are a</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:40.799" style="s2">little bit more of a fungible unit and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:41.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not not to say that everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.799" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">equal</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.760" end="01:02:48.319" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">a more predictable range and so i</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.319" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">part of my goal really is to have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.520" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">series of these things</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:59.359" style="s2">food energy hosting which is code for</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">communication and collaboration on all</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.359" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">scales right that&#39;s required hosting</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:05.520" style="s2">in this day and age housing</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">transportation as we build out that</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.520" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">suite of baseline currencies</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">it creates the possibility of a whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:13.760" style="s2">other emergent economy</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:16.000" style="s2">to be built on top of those things if</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">those things are stabilized</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.000" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">okay this is interesting i&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:20.319" style="s2">to think this through suppose we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">multiple</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.319" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">of these fungible deliverable or</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">how does one exchange amongst them right</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:34.240" style="s2">one of the great advantages of a neutral</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:36.640" style="s2">currency like gold</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.240" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">as i swap my wheat for gold and i go buy</p>

<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.680" style="s2">suppose i get you know transportation</p>

<p begin="01:04:01.760" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">this provides a base layer like you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.839" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">could say that when dollars were backed</p>

<p begin="01:04:11.119" end="01:04:15.039" style="s2">not because they were ever trading it in</p>

<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:32.799" style="s2">because they have communication</p>

<p begin="01:04:33.760" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">on hosts great but there&#39;s also going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:41.440" style="s2">be other things where</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">i want to run my my airbnb like site and</p>

<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">same thing with a currency under you</p>

<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:58.640" style="s2">or for electricity right the fact that</p>

<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">right then it means that you can</p>

<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">on it like one of the the challenges</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:13.760" style="s2">with kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">sort of stable respectable businesses</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.760" end="01:05:18.000" style="s2">getting entangled in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">crypto space is if i accept payment from</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">and it drops in value 50 how do i pay my</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:27.119" style="s2">you know so if you want to make the</p>

<p begin="01:05:27.119" end="01:05:33.440" style="s2">safe for people to play and build</p>

<p begin="01:05:34.160" end="01:05:38.079" style="s2">they can use these currencies just as</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">that unit of account just like dollars</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.079" end="01:05:42.799" style="s2">are used as a unit of account</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:44.319" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to trade miles for</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:45.839" style="s2">hosting or whatever as if they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.319" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">to use either but</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.839" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">but all it takes is having an account on</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">both systems to do so</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:55.039" style="s2">right where i get debited on one system</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.520" end="01:05:57.119" style="s2">and credited on another</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.039" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">with my transaction with somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.119" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">who has an account on both systems</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">let me have to think that through what</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">about the fact that at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">day the currency system has to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:09.760" style="s2">careful not to get itself</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">into a speculative bubble where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.760" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">of these currencies running around than</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:15.839" style="s2">there is the ability to actually deliver</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">let&#39;s say the hosting</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.839" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">if you don&#39;t get to that point how does</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">the amount of currency become</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:23.920" style="s2">significantly larger than the actual</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:26.240" style="s2">market for the hosting and hence have</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.920" end="01:06:27.599" style="s2">some additional capacity to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.240" end="01:06:29.520" style="s2">use it in these general ways i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.599" end="01:06:32.400" style="s2">sure i see that</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.520" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">well so let&#39;s take the the host credit</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.400" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">limit for example</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.160" end="01:06:37.599" style="s2">the credit limits don&#39;t expand if</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:39.359" style="s2">there&#39;s not a demand for hosting</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.599" end="01:06:41.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very tight feedback</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.359" end="01:06:44.240" style="s2">loop right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.599" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">if it&#39;s based on your last few months of</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">of hosting</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">power if the demand for hosting is</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">dwindling</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:53.039" style="s2">then so are the credit limits shrinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.039" end="01:06:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a feedback loop that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">actually tightly coupled</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.960" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">but if that&#39;s the case then how many of</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:01.920" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">posting back currency units will be</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.920" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">available for something other than</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">buying hosting</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:09.760" style="s2">so holofuel is a weird example because</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">i&#39;m such a weird currency geek</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">holofuel is a hybrid of fiat</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:17.520" style="s2">backed currency and mutual credit</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:19.359" style="s2">issuance</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.520" end="01:07:20.640" style="s2">the host example where we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.359" end="01:07:22.559" style="s2">about their credit limit</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.640" end="01:07:24.079" style="s2">is the standard classic mutual credit</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.559" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">thing where the supply expands and</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.079" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">contracts based on</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">market behavior and then the the reserve</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:32.720" style="s2">accounts where you can buy</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:33.359" style="s2">into holofuel using a cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.720" end="01:07:35.839" style="s2">like hot</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.359" end="01:07:36.799" style="s2">tokens or using dollars or euro or</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.839" end="01:07:39.920" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.799" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">that&#39;s an asset backed scenario where</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.920" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">you have dollars that back the units</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:45.920" style="s2">that you&#39;re buying</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">and hosts can redeem out for those</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.920" end="01:07:49.599" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:50.240" style="s2">or for those euro or for the the crypto</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.599" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">currency</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.240" end="01:07:54.480" style="s2">right and so you only issue credit limit</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">to that reserve account</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.480" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">as the outside currency is placed on</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">reserve</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:00.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s a backed currency in that</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:04.240" style="s2">scenario and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.960" end="01:08:06.480" style="s2">the ico that we did where we basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.240" end="01:08:08.079" style="s2">gave an initial line of credit to holo</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.480" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">as the infrastructure provider or</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.079" end="01:08:11.760" style="s2">creator</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">is kind of an active fiat right where</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.760" end="01:08:15.119" style="s2">we&#39;re saying we&#39;re building out this</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:17.839" style="s2">infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.119" end="01:08:19.679" style="s2">and we got a large you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.839" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">multi-million dollar credit limit</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.679" end="01:08:23.440" style="s2">to begin with and now we have to pay</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:25.199" style="s2">that back over time</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:27.199" style="s2">but we got this big credit limit to</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.199" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">begin with the accounting is actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:29.359" style="s2">all being done through a mutual credit</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">currency</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.359" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">but because there&#39;s different classes of</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:36.000" style="s2">accounts with different types of</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:37.199" style="s2">credit limit algorithms it allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.000" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">simulate</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.199" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">those behaviors of a fiat a backed and a</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:43.920" style="s2">mutual credit currency</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">all in one mutual credit currency</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.920" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">fernando you&#39;ve been had your hand up</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:48.319" style="s2">for a while what did you want to add to</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">the discussion</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.319" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">well you know in and out in and out</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:52.960" style="s2">because the discussion goes here goes</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:55.520" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:08:57.600" style="s2">uh but i wanted to give another example</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.520" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">on how we&#39;re thinking about jules and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.600" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">jules</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">stands for just one organics living</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:06.319" style="s2">economy system</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">and just one is a company that produces</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.319" end="01:09:11.839" style="s2">beautiful food crystals out of organic</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:15.199" style="s2">vegetables and fruits that have a very</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.839" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">big shelf life and the mission</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.199" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">of the company is to be able to grow</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">regenerative soil</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:22.799" style="s2">and help farmers or by helping farmers</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:25.600" style="s2">to grow</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.799" end="01:09:27.199" style="s2">food so you know part of the design of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:28.560" style="s2">jewels which is a constellation of</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:30.640" style="s2">different currencies</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.560" end="01:09:32.560" style="s2">one of them is a coupon which you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.640" end="01:09:33.839" style="s2">think like oh you know cubans say we see</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.560" end="01:09:36.799" style="s2">them everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.839" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">right and and they&#39;re not unusual so</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.799" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">they&#39;re easy jewels coupon that you will</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:43.520" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:45.920" style="s2">get food with and then get a coupon</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.520" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">and then the incentive is to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:49.679" style="s2">coupon for</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">as long as three years so that then just</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.679" end="01:09:55.600" style="s2">when organics can build more capacity</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.239" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">and by doing that you you grow as a</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.600" end="01:09:59.840" style="s2">buyer of the coupon</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:00.560" style="s2">you keep getting a wider percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.840" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.560" end="01:10:04.640" style="s2">now so we were in that in that design</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.280" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">with the coupons</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.640" end="01:10:09.199" style="s2">and we figured oh well it would be great</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">when people have</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.199" end="01:10:13.760" style="s2">10 more food or 20 more food how are we</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.560" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">going to do that with our current</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.760" end="01:10:18.719" style="s2">packages which are just 100 grams</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:19.920" style="s2">and we started to play with how we were</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.719" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">going to do that</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.920" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">and then we started to think well but</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:24.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not the only thing they can</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">redeem for</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.159" end="01:10:28.080" style="s2">because actually people are using the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">crystals</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.080" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2">to get and produce other foods like like</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">pixy stix for children or</p>

<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:42.800" style="s2">production that starts to happen with</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.400" end="01:10:44.880" style="s2">that food because you can really create</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.800" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">so many things with it and then we</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.880" end="01:10:49.440" style="s2">started to see</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:51.360" style="s2">how easy it would be to create a whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.440" end="01:10:52.719" style="s2">marketplace of things that then people</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.360" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">can trade for</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.719" end="01:10:57.360" style="s2">within the realm of food so if we start</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:59.280" style="s2">seeing conventional and then we really</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.360" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">wanted to work like money and we wanted</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.280" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">in the end to be able to trade it for my</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:04.880" style="s2">ai</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.000" end="01:11:05.520" style="s2">whatever or a cell phone well it might</p>

<p begin="01:11:05.520" end="01:11:10.239" style="s2">jules might just not be for that just go</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.239" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2">and get another currency that would work</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.239" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:14.239" style="s2">and play with the jewels too in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:17.520" style="s2">realm of food</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.239" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">so we create new assets new marketplaces</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.520" end="01:11:20.800" style="s2">and new possibilities you know because</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:23.040" style="s2">the mission</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.800" end="01:11:25.600" style="s2">that we have as part of the commons</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.040" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">engine because we do currency design and</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.600" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">we teach currency design</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.840" end="01:11:31.679" style="s2">is to be able to provide solutions for</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:35.120" style="s2">our biggest</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.679" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">challenges not to make people rich or</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.120" end="01:11:38.960" style="s2">create a new elite</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">like it happened with the tokens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.960" end="01:11:43.600" style="s2">actually to target</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:45.760" style="s2">currency into the solution of real</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.600" end="01:11:48.159" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.760" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">certainly interesting and good if we can</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.159" end="01:11:51.840" style="s2">actually do it</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">what&#39;s a good example of a currency</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.840" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">y&#39;all created that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:57.120" style="s2">not use hollow fuel because it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s so complicated be very very</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.120" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">hard to deconstruct all the way down but</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:04.640" style="s2">a simpler example where a currency</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:07.840" style="s2">design solved a real world problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.640" end="01:12:09.199" style="s2">i feel like i do a lot of that but this</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.840" end="01:12:12.000" style="s2">is in the domain of</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.199" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">currencies that people don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.000" end="01:12:16.080" style="s2">always think of as</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.120" end="01:12:18.000" style="s2">currency and i want to give an example</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:19.280" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.000" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">that i like where i was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.280" end="01:12:24.000" style="s2">encourage people to solve a real world</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:24.719" style="s2">problem it&#39;s just a very vivid example i</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.000" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.719" end="01:12:28.719" style="s2">unfortunately they didn&#39;t use it but</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s still i think a worthwhile example</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.719" end="01:12:31.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s so obvious to see how it</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:33.360" style="s2">solves the problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.040" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">at occupy wall street they had this</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:37.199" style="s2">reinventing money work group</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:38.719" style="s2">that uh you know wanted to create some</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.199" end="01:12:39.679" style="s2">sort of occupy dollar so they could</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.719" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">actually like</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.679" end="01:12:43.360" style="s2">pay the people that were contributing</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:46.640" style="s2">various things</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:48.159" style="s2">food and you know um sleeping bags</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.640" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">and stuff like that in these in these</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.159" end="01:12:52.400" style="s2">occupy bucks and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:54.080" style="s2">they came to us we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.400" end="01:12:55.040" style="s2">i&#39;m like are you having a problem with</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.080" end="01:12:56.800" style="s2">those flows</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.040" end="01:12:58.320" style="s2">right now they&#39;re like well no</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.800" end="01:13:01.280" style="s2">everything&#39;s going really great i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.320" end="01:13:02.400" style="s2">why would you want to insert a currency</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.280" end="01:13:03.920" style="s2">into it why would you want to</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.400" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">put something in place that&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.920" end="01:13:08.560" style="s2">to shit to change the pattern of flows</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:10.239" style="s2">in a pattern of flows that&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.560" end="01:13:11.840" style="s2">right let&#39;s take a pattern of flows that</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.239" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t working let&#39;s take a real world</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.840" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">problem that you want to solve</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:17.679" style="s2">that&#39;s going on there&#39;s well for example</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.000" end="01:13:19.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve got we have problems sleeping you</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.679" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">know the police often just send people</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.280" end="01:13:22.159" style="s2">down here when they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:24.320" style="s2">released from jail saying hey there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:31.040" style="s2">aren&#39;t always here for the same reasons</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.280" end="01:13:33.520" style="s2">as us and they don&#39;t always follow</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.040" end="01:13:34.080" style="s2">our rules about like quiet time after 10</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.520" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">p.m</p>

<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">that and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.400" end="01:13:41.440" style="s2">for those of us that actually have jobs</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:43.600" style="s2">and have to work but we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.440" end="01:13:46.400" style="s2">staying down here and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.600" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">we end up not being able to sleep and</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.400" end="01:13:50.159" style="s2">like well you&#39;re not able to address</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">that in the general assembly and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.159" end="01:13:53.679" style="s2">like no because it&#39;s it keeps being</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">turned into a personal</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.679" end="01:13:58.000" style="s2">issue you know and it&#39;s harder to see</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:13:58.640" style="s2">the overall pattern i&#39;m like great okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.000" end="01:14:01.040" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.640" end="01:14:02.239" style="s2">so uh and i think actually eric harris</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.040" end="01:14:03.840" style="s2">brown came up with the first part of</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.239" end="01:14:05.520" style="s2">this is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:07.199" style="s2">what what happens in the morning where</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.520" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">can we get this feedback and make it</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.199" end="01:14:11.679" style="s2">visible to everyone well</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.480" end="01:14:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a breakfast line and you can</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.679" end="01:14:14.000" style="s2">have everybody as they get in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.880" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">breakfast line give them</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.000" end="01:14:20.560" style="s2">a coffee bean and have three jars</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">with a green yellow red lid if you will</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.560" end="01:14:22.880" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:26.320" style="s2">tape on them or whatever ideally they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.880" end="01:14:29.360" style="s2">be narrow in tall jars</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.320" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">and they drop their coffee bean in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.360" end="01:14:32.400" style="s2">jar</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:33.520" style="s2">appropriate to whether they got great</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.400" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">sleep green</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.520" end="01:14:37.679" style="s2">horrible not enough sleep red or</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:40.159" style="s2">somewhere not so great but in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.679" end="01:14:43.120" style="s2">you know yellow and it&#39;s just every day</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.159" end="01:14:45.760" style="s2">you can actually have the community</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.120" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">see the health of the community from the</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.760" end="01:14:49.679" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">right from how tall which jars you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.679" end="01:14:53.760" style="s2">get stacked up inside of there right</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">so this is sort of like a reputation</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.760" end="01:14:57.920" style="s2">currency it has limited</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:15:00.000" style="s2">issuance for the you know you getting in</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.920" end="01:15:02.719" style="s2">the in the breakfast line</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.000" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">but it it it&#39;s more reliable than like</p>

<p begin="01:15:04.560" end="01:15:09.520" style="s2">some kind of survey because of sampling</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.520" end="01:15:13.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s you don&#39;t even have to count it</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.679" end="01:15:14.159" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a non-numerical currency if</p>

<p begin="01:15:14.159" end="01:15:17.679" style="s2">just make the jars the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.920" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">shape you can see the levels you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.679" end="01:15:20.880" style="s2">you&#39;re just eyeballing what is the</p>

<p begin="01:15:20.880" end="01:15:24.960" style="s2">not very many people are getting good</p>

<p begin="01:15:53.120" end="01:15:57.440" style="s2">done some thinking about non-numeric</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.199" end="01:15:59.600" style="s2">currencies and there was a good example</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.440" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">how would you distinguish a non-numeric</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.600" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">from the numeric currencies and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">what are some other examples or what</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">kind of classes of problems would</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:10.480" style="s2">non-numeric currencies be useful for</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.560" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">well i think it&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.480" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">recognize different</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:15.520" style="s2">forms of formalization when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:16:20.239" end="01:16:23.600" style="s2">a social scientist put in place these</p>

<p begin="01:16:31.280" end="01:16:36.800" style="s2">fully quantitative often right</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.719" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">not always true but it&#39;s generally</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.800" end="01:16:39.360" style="s2">easier to make things fully quantitative</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.000" end="01:16:49.360" style="s2">so what he introduced was these</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.520" end="01:16:50.560" style="s2">different types of things of you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.360" end="01:16:51.920" style="s2">rational numbers</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.560" end="01:16:53.760" style="s2">things that actually can be divided into</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.920" end="01:16:56.080" style="s2">parts have ratios of things</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.760" end="01:16:57.760" style="s2">you have interval or integral numbers</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.760" end="01:17:00.960" style="s2">you have ordinal numbers rankings of</p>

<p begin="01:17:00.960" end="01:17:04.480" style="s2">and you have nominal you would not call</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:06.560" style="s2">them numbers you&#39;d have nominal</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.480" end="01:17:08.239" style="s2">categories names for things</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.560" end="01:17:10.239" style="s2">and what&#39;s what&#39;s really interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.239" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">you can make currencies</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.239" end="01:17:14.080" style="s2">embody any of these kinds of patterns</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.719" end="01:17:16.640" style="s2">like typically</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.080" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">most good reputation currencies steer</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.640" end="01:17:22.400" style="s2">very far away from the rational end of</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:23.600" style="s2">of that spectrum if you will right you</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:25.679" style="s2">say you have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.600" end="01:17:26.719" style="s2">you know a bachelor&#39;s of science in this</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.679" end="01:17:29.840" style="s2">or a phd</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.719" end="01:17:30.480" style="s2">in this that&#39;s a nominal currency right</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.840" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.480" end="01:17:34.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the name of a particular level</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:36.800" style="s2">and then you even might</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.480" end="01:17:38.080" style="s2">might also name the issuer you know from</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.800" end="01:17:40.960" style="s2">harvard university</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.080" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">or you know whatever if you also want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.960" end="01:17:45.040" style="s2">ride on the nominal</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:46.320" style="s2">status of that university and we use</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.040" end="01:17:49.440" style="s2">jobs and titles</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.320" end="01:17:51.440" style="s2">for the same thing right ceo or</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.440" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">you know like these are these are</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.440" end="01:17:56.000" style="s2">nominal currencies that</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:56.719" style="s2">carry a bunch of reputational signals in</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.000" end="01:17:59.840" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.719" end="01:18:01.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not numeric and what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.840" end="01:18:03.679" style="s2">interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.120" end="01:18:04.719" style="s2">how you can design currencies to</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.679" end="01:18:07.440" style="s2">resonate</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.719" end="01:18:08.960" style="s2">with different audiences based on how</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:11.040" style="s2">you formalize them</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.960" end="01:18:12.640" style="s2">and you may have initially collected</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.040" end="01:18:16.000" style="s2">some numeric data</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.640" end="01:18:17.920" style="s2">right your grades and test scores</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.000" end="01:18:19.040" style="s2">and your credits right your grades and</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.920" end="01:18:22.239" style="s2">test scores may have been</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.040" end="01:18:24.560" style="s2">rational numbers your credits were</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.239" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">interval integral numbers integers whole</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.560" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">numbers</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:30.000" style="s2">but then you get a degree that&#39;s issued</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">in the form of a nominal currency</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.000" end="01:18:33.120" style="s2">so if you&#39;re creating reputation systems</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:34.880" style="s2">on a</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.120" end="01:18:36.400" style="s2">you know a website an online community</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.880" end="01:18:37.040" style="s2">or something like that often what you</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.400" end="01:18:39.280" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.040" end="01:18:40.640" style="s2">is not have the reputation be a number</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.280" end="01:18:43.360" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.640" end="01:18:44.880" style="s2">you want to have it be a name that</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.360" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">you&#39;ve achieved this level of</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.880" end="01:18:48.080" style="s2">citizenship or this type of helper or</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:50.640" style="s2">this type of mentor</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.080" end="01:18:52.480" style="s2">this type of you know whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">different kinds of things are</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.480" end="01:18:58.080" style="s2">and you embody the values</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.520" end="01:18:59.840" style="s2">of the community and and the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.080" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2">appreciation of the community in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.840" end="01:19:04.159" style="s2">naming</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:06.640" style="s2">of those levels right and</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.159" end="01:19:08.320" style="s2">it makes all the difference in the world</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.640" end="01:19:10.560" style="s2">how you encode these things</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.320" end="01:19:12.400" style="s2">we could get into a whole other spiral</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.560" end="01:19:13.120" style="s2">dynamics conversations about the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.400" end="01:19:14.800" style="s2">the different</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.120" end="01:19:17.120" style="s2">colors of memes that the different</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.800" end="01:19:19.120" style="s2">formalizations resonate with</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.120" end="01:19:21.040" style="s2">we all have had so much experience of</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.120" end="01:19:24.560" style="s2">being dehumanized</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.040" end="01:19:26.239" style="s2">by money by these rational numbers you</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.560" end="01:19:28.800" style="s2">are dealing with green mean people that</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.239" end="01:19:31.760" style="s2">are trying to sort of re-humanize</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.800" end="01:19:33.040" style="s2">and build you know communitarian types</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.760" end="01:19:34.960" style="s2">of values into things</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.040" end="01:19:37.440" style="s2">and you bring a currency system to them</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.960" end="01:19:40.400" style="s2">that&#39;s all about these rational numbers</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.440" end="01:19:41.679" style="s2">or even rankings in social status you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.400" end="01:19:43.679" style="s2">going to repel</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.679" end="01:19:45.600" style="s2">people from participating what you want</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.679" end="01:19:48.800" style="s2">to do in that scenario is have</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.600" end="01:19:51.840" style="s2">whole numbers of contributions and</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.800" end="01:19:53.840" style="s2">named levels of participation</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.840" end="01:19:55.840" style="s2">name types of participation that type of</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.840" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">thing and that resonates very strongly</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.840" end="01:19:58.719" style="s2">with the green meme</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:19:59.840" style="s2">got a whole map around these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.719" end="01:20:00.960" style="s2">things for when you&#39;re designing</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.840" end="01:20:02.320" style="s2">currencies</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.960" end="01:20:04.320" style="s2">who&#39;s your audience and how do you</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.320" end="01:20:07.040" style="s2">design make it make sure your design</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.320" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">actually maps to the right social frame</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.040" end="01:20:12.000" style="s2">like we were originally talking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:13.440" style="s2">around reputation currencies and such or</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.000" end="01:20:15.360" style="s2">any type of currencies</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.440" end="01:20:16.639" style="s2">the further you go from the social frame</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.360" end="01:20:18.400" style="s2">of who you&#39;re trying to have participate</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.639" end="01:20:21.760" style="s2">the more cognitive overhead</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.400" end="01:20:22.880" style="s2">there is and anyway there&#39;s a lot of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.760" end="01:20:24.400" style="s2">lot of work there</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.880" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">for that and then you can solve very</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.400" end="01:20:29.120" style="s2">concrete real world problems with this</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:30.400" style="s2">you know like went into a school a small</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.120" end="01:20:32.719" style="s2">private school that had</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.400" end="01:20:34.480" style="s2">had basically collapsed all the staff</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.719" end="01:20:36.480" style="s2">quit two weeks before school</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.480" end="01:20:38.560" style="s2">it started and i stepped in as the</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.480" end="01:20:40.800" style="s2">temporary executive director</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.560" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">and turned manhattan free school around</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.800" end="01:20:44.719" style="s2">into an agile learning center</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:46.880" style="s2">and agile learning centers then took off</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.719" end="01:20:49.040" style="s2">and have grown to last i checked about</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.880" end="01:20:50.880" style="s2">like 92 schools all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.040" end="01:20:52.400" style="s2">but it was all through these types of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.880" end="01:20:54.560" style="s2">current seas</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.400" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">setting up the feedback loops so that</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.560" end="01:20:59.040" style="s2">the community could see themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">manage themselves more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.040" end="01:21:02.800" style="s2">okay very interesting you know again</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:04.800" style="s2">some of it&#39;s back to the past as we</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.800" end="01:21:07.920" style="s2">talked about you know the medieval guild</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.800" end="01:21:09.760" style="s2">systems had all kinds of intricate ranks</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.920" end="01:21:11.280" style="s2">and none of it was numeric of course in</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.760" end="01:21:13.679" style="s2">those days it had to do with</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.280" end="01:21:15.840" style="s2">items of dress that you were allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.679" end="01:21:17.040" style="s2">wear the sumptuary laws you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.840" end="01:21:18.159" style="s2">depending on where you were in the</p>

<p begin="01:21:20.239" end="01:21:24.159" style="s2">were not or you were allowed to have</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.840" end="01:21:27.360" style="s2">buckles on your shoes or you were</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.159" end="01:21:29.040" style="s2">not these are you know highly analog</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.360" end="01:21:30.719" style="s2">signaling system so your and your</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.040" end="01:21:34.080" style="s2">hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.719" end="01:21:36.800" style="s2">people who are in the post-modern epoch</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.080" end="01:21:39.199" style="s2">are more likely to react well to these</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.800" end="01:21:40.159" style="s2">kind of analog signals as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.199" end="01:21:43.199" style="s2">digital signals</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.159" end="01:21:45.199" style="s2">is that part of your hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.199" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">well analog and digital doesn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.199" end="01:21:47.760" style="s2">map because</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:49.600" style="s2">obviously many of these things are still</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.760" end="01:21:52.960" style="s2">coming through digital media</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.600" end="01:21:56.000" style="s2">right but it&#39;s not quantitative it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.960" end="01:21:59.040" style="s2">numeric right when you&#39;re wearing</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.000" end="01:22:01.040" style="s2">the dress of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.040" end="01:22:02.719" style="s2">you know carpenter with the two zippers</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.040" end="01:22:03.120" style="s2">down the front of your pants and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.719" end="01:22:05.199" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.120" end="01:22:07.280" style="s2">you know that that kind of thing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.199" end="01:22:10.560" style="s2">sending a particular visual signal</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.280" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">it&#39;s providing cues for what</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.560" end="01:22:16.560" style="s2">role you play in the community</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:18.880" style="s2">right and so you still need signaling</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.560" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">systems for those cues</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.880" end="01:22:22.400" style="s2">but numbers are not necessarily the best</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:24.080" style="s2">signals</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.400" end="01:22:26.719" style="s2">in fact numbers are kind of horrible</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.080" end="01:22:28.000" style="s2">signals so i can give you an example of</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.719" end="01:22:31.040" style="s2">that if you want</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.000" end="01:22:32.480" style="s2">sure and that&#39;s something that i would</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.040" end="01:22:35.600" style="s2">like to see designed</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.480" end="01:22:36.800" style="s2">for organizations and communities could</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.600" end="01:22:39.199" style="s2">do the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.800" end="01:22:40.480" style="s2">so let&#39;s say that you wanted to see what</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.199" end="01:22:44.000" style="s2">is the morale or</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.480" end="01:22:44.560" style="s2">what is the what is the um energetics of</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.000" end="01:22:46.560" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.560" end="01:22:48.960" style="s2">in a given field you know within an</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.560" end="01:22:51.040" style="s2">organization to set this example</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.960" end="01:22:53.199" style="s2">and you know people come sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.040" end="01:22:54.239" style="s2">stress or sometimes they&#39;re flowing and</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.199" end="01:22:57.120" style="s2">happy</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.239" end="01:22:58.719" style="s2">and you don&#39;t get to know that but how</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.120" end="01:23:00.719" style="s2">they come unless you ask them hey how</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.719" end="01:23:02.159" style="s2">you feel today what&#39;s up for you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.719" end="01:23:04.719" style="s2">new for you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.159" end="01:23:07.040" style="s2">but what if we would have like a way in</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.719" end="01:23:09.920" style="s2">which people could have like a color</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.040" end="01:23:10.560" style="s2">spectrum like a rainbow type and you</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.920" end="01:23:13.679" style="s2">know we</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.560" end="01:23:14.239" style="s2">just decide the value of each of these</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.679" end="01:23:15.679" style="s2">colors</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.239" end="01:23:17.280" style="s2">and let&#39;s say that red is when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.679" end="01:23:19.679" style="s2">really stressed</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.280" end="01:23:21.760" style="s2">and you know like yellow is when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.679" end="01:23:23.360" style="s2">really happy and centered</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.760" end="01:23:25.040" style="s2">and then people come and they just</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.360" end="01:23:26.880" style="s2">choose a color in the day</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.040" end="01:23:28.960" style="s2">and then you see a dashboard of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.880" end="01:23:29.440" style="s2">going on with the organization in the in</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.960" end="01:23:31.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.440" end="01:23:33.679" style="s2">middle of the day and you get a sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.840" end="01:23:35.920" style="s2">and sometimes you know as</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.679" end="01:23:37.920" style="s2">working in organizational architecture i</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.920" end="01:23:38.560" style="s2">can tell you would be so valuable</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.920" end="01:23:42.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.560" end="01:23:46.080" style="s2">it provides a sensing for me as</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.800" end="01:23:48.320" style="s2">a person in hr or a person in community</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.080" end="01:23:52.159" style="s2">building to be able to know</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.320" end="01:23:52.719" style="s2">what is happening fast without having to</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.159" end="01:23:56.080" style="s2">go to</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.719" end="01:23:58.320" style="s2">asks people and if sometimes is red</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:24:00.560" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s accurate even to what was</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.320" end="01:24:02.080" style="s2">matching my own personal sense of oh</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.560" end="01:24:04.480" style="s2">today&#39;s a red day</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.080" end="01:24:06.560" style="s2">of course we just started the covet</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.480" end="01:24:07.280" style="s2">everybody sent home they didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.560" end="01:24:09.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.280" end="01:24:10.560" style="s2">of course we&#39;re red i don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.120" end="01:24:12.159" style="s2">anything about it but</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.560" end="01:24:14.880" style="s2">you know another given date could be</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.159" end="01:24:16.639" style="s2">like oh payroll just happened and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.880" end="01:24:19.040" style="s2">red i wonder if there&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.639" end="01:24:21.360" style="s2">happening that i need to ask about</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.040" end="01:24:23.120" style="s2">and but you get an immediate uh in</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.360" end="01:24:24.719" style="s2">collective intelligence we say the word</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.120" end="01:24:27.840" style="s2">collapticism you get</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.719" end="01:24:30.719" style="s2">a whole optical view right like a</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.840" end="01:24:32.639" style="s2">sense of the whole we need a dashboard</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.719" end="01:24:34.080" style="s2">that provides you certain colors of a</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.639" end="01:24:36.159" style="s2">spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.080" end="01:24:37.120" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting i think we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.159" end="01:24:39.600" style="s2">out of time here</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.120" end="01:24:40.639" style="s2">about to wrap up but i will ask one</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.600" end="01:24:43.440" style="s2">question that</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.639" end="01:24:44.000" style="s2">maybe teases at this a little bit if we</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.440" end="01:24:47.600" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.000" end="01:24:49.520" style="s2">what&#39;s probably the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.600" end="01:24:52.000" style="s2">reputation system at least that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.520" end="01:24:53.199" style="s2">aware of in the united states maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.000" end="01:24:57.760" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.199" end="01:24:59.679" style="s2">it&#39;s the amazon star rating system</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.760" end="01:25:01.520" style="s2">people pay a lot of attention to that it</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.679" end="01:25:03.760" style="s2">actually kind of works</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.520" end="01:25:04.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that it is both</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.760" end="01:25:07.920" style="s2">analog</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.560" end="01:25:11.120" style="s2">and digital in some sense right you rank</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.920" end="01:25:12.239" style="s2">one to five stars or integer and real</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.120" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">number at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.239" end="01:25:15.760" style="s2">and yet the resultant thing that i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.400" end="01:25:19.120" style="s2">we all tend to work on</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.760" end="01:25:20.560" style="s2">is some estimated real number average</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.120" end="01:25:22.239" style="s2">number of stars</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.560" end="01:25:23.679" style="s2">they also do clever things like show you</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.239" end="01:25:25.280" style="s2">other dimensions like they&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.679" end="01:25:26.960" style="s2">show you the histogram if you know how</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.280" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">to get to it etc</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.960" end="01:25:32.080" style="s2">how does the amazon star rating system</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:36.239" style="s2">fit into your design space</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.080" end="01:25:39.199" style="s2">well frankly i think it&#39;s a little poor</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.239" end="01:25:40.000" style="s2">uh it&#39;s not dimensional enough there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.199" end="01:25:41.520" style="s2">whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.000" end="01:25:44.080" style="s2">i wrote up once about this actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.520" end="01:25:45.760" style="s2">regarding the ebay rating system</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.080" end="01:25:47.840" style="s2">that exists it&#39;s like if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.760" end="01:25:48.480" style="s2">to figure out what it is that a buyer</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.840" end="01:25:50.239" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.480" end="01:25:51.840" style="s2">to know they&#39;re like yeah there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.239" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">quality of the product there&#39;s quality</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.840" end="01:25:55.360" style="s2">of communication if there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:56.560" style="s2">and sorting out things there&#39;s the speed</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.360" end="01:25:58.159" style="s2">of delivery</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.560" end="01:26:00.400" style="s2">right now amazon&#39;s gotten the speed of</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.159" end="01:26:02.800" style="s2">delivery down a lot and they try to</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.400" end="01:26:04.560" style="s2">give you that information in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.800" end="01:26:06.800" style="s2">checkout process anyway</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.560" end="01:26:07.760" style="s2">but this is originally for for ebay that</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.800" end="01:26:09.280" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.760" end="01:26:10.560" style="s2">and you want all these things to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.280" end="01:26:13.360" style="s2">different dimensions you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.560" end="01:26:15.840" style="s2">just give a plus one or minus one</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.360" end="01:26:17.360" style="s2">right you you actually need to give the</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.840" end="01:26:19.280" style="s2">person dimensionality so that they can</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.360" end="01:26:21.360" style="s2">make smarter decisions</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.280" end="01:26:22.560" style="s2">in fact i would diverge from your</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.360" end="01:26:25.040" style="s2">example of</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.560" end="01:26:27.199" style="s2">amazon as maybe the most influential</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.040" end="01:26:29.840" style="s2">thing and i would look for example that</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.199" end="01:26:30.400" style="s2">olympic gold medals or olympic medals</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.840" end="01:26:32.320" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.400" end="01:26:34.320" style="s2">you know when you consider that they</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.320" end="01:26:36.080" style="s2">shape the participation of millions of</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.320" end="01:26:38.800" style="s2">athletes in every country all</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.080" end="01:26:40.560" style="s2">over the world and then there&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.800" end="01:26:42.880" style="s2">subsidiary currencies</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.560" end="01:26:44.639" style="s2">that are involved in the score making</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.880" end="01:26:46.800" style="s2">that allow somebody to get into the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.639" end="01:26:49.199" style="s2">olympics that allows them to win a medal</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.800" end="01:26:50.880" style="s2">the medals are just an ordinal currency</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.199" end="01:26:51.600" style="s2">they&#39;re just first second third they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.880" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">called</p>
