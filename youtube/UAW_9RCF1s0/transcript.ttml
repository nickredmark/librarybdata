<p begin="00:00:00.740" end="00:00:06.480" style="s2">all right welcome to the idea cafe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.290" end="00:00:08.700" style="s2">going to do a four part series over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.480" end="00:00:10.620" style="s2">next four weeks seeing how the four</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.700" end="00:00:13.530" style="s2">questions play up when we do them at</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.620" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">idea cafe so today&#39;s question is Who am</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.530" end="00:00:16.289" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">the other three questions are who are my</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.289" end="00:00:21.150" style="s2">people what is my purpose and what do I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">need so today is Who am I who would like</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.150" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">to start yeah I will because I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:29.490" style="s2">excited about this notion I I really</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">like it a lot I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.490" end="00:00:37.170" style="s2">simple and powerful engine to have at</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:39.210" style="s2">the core of any kind of personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.170" end="00:00:40.290" style="s2">development program right whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.210" end="00:00:42.770" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.290" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">you know from education right through to</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.770" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">psychology right through to trauma</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">really no trauma healing all of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">kind of stuff I think I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:57.140" style="s2">really valuable cycle to have at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">center and so yeah like the two parts of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.140" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">creating a vigorous healthy culture are</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">good people and good ways of going about</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">doing things right I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">solves the Google not solves it but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">mean if it&#39;s engaged in faithfully has</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">the potential to be the thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">forever creating better and better</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">people in the society so yeah I they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">in in question two there is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">which slightly troubles me but we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">to that when we talk about question two</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:29.340" style="s2">but but the cycle as a whole beginning</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">with who am i and then in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.340" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">an ever increasing and deepening</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">knowledge of Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">how do I want to go about finding people</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2">with whom I can collaborate you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:42.119" style="s2">figuring out what what what is the what</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">is the what is the best contribution I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.119" end="00:01:46.170" style="s2">can make to the world and what do I need</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">to go about doing that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.170" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">great I think it&#39;s great really simple</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:50.680" style="s2">lovely thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:54.820" style="s2">some things there do you want to answer</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.680" end="00:01:56.650" style="s2">the question Who am I well like I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.820" end="00:01:59.740" style="s2">this is a this is a constant work in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.650" end="00:02:02.890" style="s2">progress right so yeah okay so in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.740" end="00:02:04.659" style="s2">current state of development if you like</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.890" end="00:02:09.979" style="s2">I guess my answer to that question would</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.659" end="00:02:13.459" style="s2">be something along the lines of I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.979" end="00:02:16.430" style="s2">a portion of the universe which</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.459" end="00:02:21.409" style="s2">temporarily has a boundary drawn around</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.430" end="00:02:25.940" style="s2">it such that the illusion of separation</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.409" end="00:02:27.620" style="s2">is lived out and so yes um something</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.940" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">like that something like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.620" end="00:02:32.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s who am i right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.200" end="00:02:34.280" style="s2">something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.200" end="00:02:43.610" style="s2">thanks David do you want to share do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.280" end="00:02:45.769" style="s2">want me to share yeah so similar to Erik</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.610" end="00:02:48.230" style="s2">think that there&#39;s something it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.769" end="00:02:51.859" style="s2">fractal question for me so I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.230" end="00:02:55.609" style="s2">that I have my roles that I engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.859" end="00:02:57.620" style="s2">and I&#39;ve separated out from the working</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.609" end="00:03:00.859" style="s2">class temporarily in order to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.620" end="00:03:04.299" style="s2">more deeply what this question means but</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.859" end="00:03:07.579" style="s2">I&#39;m noticing that the the holographic</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.299" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">relationship between Who I am in my in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.579" end="00:03:14.810" style="s2">my family life to Who I am in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.030" end="00:03:18.849" style="s2">neighborhood who I am in my and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.810" end="00:03:22.190" style="s2">culture is changing I feel like I am a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.849" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">convener of voices around a central</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.190" end="00:03:26.569" style="s2">question of what is this changing moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:29.180" style="s2">for us there is a something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.569" end="00:03:35.450" style="s2">been feeling for a while that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.180" end="00:03:38.389" style="s2">through in this I&#39;ll say only somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.450" end="00:03:41.780" style="s2">with a wink I think that I have I&#39;m a I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.389" end="00:03:42.609" style="s2">am somewhat of a wizard and collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.780" end="00:03:47.450" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.609" end="00:03:49.489" style="s2">so I mean wizard and kind of a Harry</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.450" end="00:03:51.019" style="s2">Potter first year kind of I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.489" end="00:03:54.349" style="s2">got some super powers for discerning</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.019" end="00:03:56.599" style="s2">what&#39;s happening here and I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.349" end="00:04:00.440" style="s2">what I&#39;m actually capable of but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.599" end="00:04:03.500" style="s2">gonna have a sense of what what domains</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.440" end="00:04:07.099" style="s2">to travel in which contexts to listen</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.500" end="00:04:09.349" style="s2">more deeply to and where those</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.099" end="00:04:13.069" style="s2">conversations are bearing fruit so</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.349" end="00:04:20.269" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the big overview of Who I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.069" end="00:04:24.050" style="s2">am I am a citizen of the world more than</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.269" end="00:04:25.970" style="s2">have any particular nationality more so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.050" end="00:04:27.410" style="s2">which is an interesting notion and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.970" end="00:04:31.550" style="s2">trying to figure out how that how that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.410" end="00:04:37.129" style="s2">works and I&#39;m I&#39;m it</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.550" end="00:04:39.800" style="s2">I am maturing in the liminal space like</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.129" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">yeah actually actually that&#39;s that feels</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.800" end="00:04:43.940" style="s2">more accurate than the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:48.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a citizen of the liminal space I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.940" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">pause there thank you Who am I what a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.830" end="00:04:55.550" style="s2">question what a question I am a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:59.330" style="s2">things I am a lot of like categories</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.550" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">that I pick and choose whether actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.330" end="00:05:02.720" style="s2">pick and choose like it&#39;s my choice or</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:05.180" style="s2">whether it&#39;s just part of who I am what</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:07.880" style="s2">that of what part of that label applies</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.180" end="00:05:11.210" style="s2">to me and what doesn&#39;t so I go through</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.880" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">like all of those labels I am a middle</p>

<p begin="00:05:13.220" end="00:05:18.139" style="s2">definitely has a imprint on my on my</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.740" end="00:05:20.659" style="s2">soul but I more resonate with where I</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.010" end="00:07:46.690" style="s2">listened to your two answers to who I am</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.750" end="00:07:49.430" style="s2">that mine was just a little bit too meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.690" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">and and perhaps I should get down into</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.430" end="00:07:55.730" style="s2">you know yeah that as you two have done</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:57.470" style="s2">sort of what I don&#39;t know I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.730" end="00:07:58.970" style="s2">the driving forces are I think in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.470" end="00:08:01.580" style="s2">life right now yeah something something</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.970" end="00:08:02.930" style="s2">like that and so yeah I really like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.580" end="00:08:04.460" style="s2">actually there&#39;s elements of what both</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.930" end="00:08:06.980" style="s2">of you said that I really like and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.460" end="00:08:07.280" style="s2">really identify David the citizen of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.980" end="00:08:09.020" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.280" end="00:08:10.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a quote by Thomas Paine with</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.020" end="00:08:11.600" style="s2">which you are no doubt familiar yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.580" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">a citizen of the world and my religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.600" end="00:08:17.150" style="s2">is to do good I I like that I like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:19.910" style="s2">simplicity of that and and I identify</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.150" end="00:08:22.370" style="s2">with that I also very much identify what</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.910" end="00:08:24.350" style="s2">Jubilee said in that you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.370" end="00:08:25.760" style="s2">journey it&#39;s not a destination who you</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.350" end="00:08:27.140" style="s2">are it&#39;s a journey who you are is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.760" end="00:08:28.520" style="s2">forever changing and your knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.140" end="00:08:30.380" style="s2">who you are is forever changing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.520" end="00:08:32.780" style="s2">deepening as well right and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.380" end="00:08:34.760" style="s2">it&#39;s somewhere where you never really</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.780" end="00:08:36.680" style="s2">get right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.760" end="00:08:40.060" style="s2">unfolding and uncovering and a pulling</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.680" end="00:08:42.969" style="s2">back of Bale&#39;s and so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.060" end="00:08:46.180" style="s2">what I would say my main thing is in</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.969" end="00:08:48.520" style="s2">these times is connecting things</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.180" end="00:08:51.460" style="s2">together and by that I mean both people</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.520" end="00:08:53.770" style="s2">and ideas from different domains and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.460" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">and fusing them into my own thing I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.770" end="00:09:02.650" style="s2">guess that&#39;s an end and trying to I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:04.180" style="s2">I have a certain attitude for understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.650" end="00:09:05.740" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m not smart enough to come up</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.180" end="00:09:08.170" style="s2">with them but I can understand other</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.740" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">people&#39;s big ideas and then distill the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.170" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">essence out of them so that they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:14.710" style="s2">more easily communicated to others I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:16.150" style="s2">feel that my role is something something</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.710" end="00:09:19.140" style="s2">in that domain right though the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.150" end="00:09:21.430" style="s2">connecting of different groups of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.140" end="00:09:26.290" style="s2">basically like-minded people together</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.430" end="00:09:27.400" style="s2">and translating all of those ideas into</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.290" end="00:09:28.839" style="s2">a common language that they can all</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.400" end="00:09:38.680" style="s2">understand something like that something</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.839" end="00:09:39.700" style="s2">like that thank you I like the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.680" end="00:09:40.570" style="s2">something you just said and then I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.700" end="00:09:43.570" style="s2">down Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.570" end="00:09:47.230" style="s2">which is not a note that&#39;s not a note</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.570" end="00:09:52.510" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s the conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.230" end="00:09:57.130" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll come back it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.510" end="00:10:03.910" style="s2">that that this question is more involved</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.130" end="00:10:06.130" style="s2">and alive than it&#39;s ever been before and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.910" end="00:10:09.339" style="s2">I love what you said Jubilee about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.130" end="00:10:12.310" style="s2">fact that you don&#39;t even know what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.339" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">fully are right now right and so having</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.310" end="00:10:17.530" style="s2">having conversation with Eric yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:20.290" style="s2">actually we were talking about binary</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.530" end="00:10:22.360" style="s2">and non binary right and so it&#39;s a just</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.290" end="00:10:25.390" style="s2">take a look at binary and non binary</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.360" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">labels and even the labels do a poor job</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.390" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">of actually describing Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:36.010" style="s2">I heard Nora Bateson say recently but</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">who I am is a description of like my</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.010" end="00:10:41.589" style="s2">body is the description of Who I am and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.040" end="00:10:45.220" style="s2">it&#39;s such a different notion of the word</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.589" end="00:10:50.950" style="s2">description right it&#39;s a description not</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.220" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">as a propositional or verbal list of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.950" end="00:10:59.020" style="s2">attributes in activities</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:11:03.690" style="s2">as a living breathing embodied response</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.020" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">to my environment and my internal</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.690" end="00:11:10.600" style="s2">response to that environment so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.210" end="00:11:17.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a it is a very much like learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.600" end="00:11:21.730" style="s2">to internalize my own authorship of my</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.650" end="00:11:24.430" style="s2">participation in this larger context</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.730" end="00:11:26.650" style="s2">which I&#39;m also a part right i if I look</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.430" end="00:11:28.029" style="s2">at it it trying to divide and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.650" end="00:11:30.550" style="s2">Daniels muckenberger does some really</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.029" end="00:11:33.910" style="s2">good job of looking at this as well how</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.550" end="00:11:37.750" style="s2">do I actually distinguish where I start</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.910" end="00:11:41.950" style="s2">and I end right I can&#39;t exist without my</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.750" end="00:11:43.810" style="s2">environment so I can&#39;t exist without my</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.950" end="00:11:46.510" style="s2">body so there&#39;s a there&#39;s somewhat an</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.810" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">arbitrary line there it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.510" end="00:11:53.860" style="s2">because there&#39;s some interior feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:58.020" style="s2">this but if I if I stick too tightly to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.860" end="00:12:01.660" style="s2">that distinction then I can pollute or</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.020" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">under undermine my environment such the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.660" end="00:12:05.260" style="s2">way this is the same as I can&#39;t with my</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:07.240" style="s2">body right if I don&#39;t actually treat my</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.260" end="00:12:08.440" style="s2">body like it&#39;s a the vehicle that I need</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.240" end="00:12:08.860" style="s2">to respect in order to carry me to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.440" end="00:12:11.290" style="s2">finish line</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.860" end="00:12:12.430" style="s2">it&#39;s expendable I can just do whatever I</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.290" end="00:12:15.580" style="s2">want to with it then it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.430" end="00:12:17.950" style="s2">carry me very far all right so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.580" end="00:12:22.089" style="s2">moment in time that I consider how wide</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.950" end="00:12:22.780" style="s2">a window I look at magical augment to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.089" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.780" end="00:12:28.810" style="s2">like who I think I am hmm try remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:31.150" style="s2">of what I was going to write it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.810" end="00:12:34.210" style="s2">actually when Eric was talking was there</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.150" end="00:12:36.520" style="s2">was something coming up on if it can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.210" end="00:12:39.459" style="s2">put into a job description it&#39;s not who</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.520" end="00:12:40.870" style="s2">you are but like although you might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.459" end="00:12:42.670" style="s2">an engineer you might be a doctor you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.870" end="00:12:44.380" style="s2">might be like someone had posted on one</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.670" end="00:12:47.110" style="s2">of my and it&#39;s something I constantly</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.380" end="00:12:48.970" style="s2">come up with in my own ego of like what</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.110" end="00:12:51.970" style="s2">is my role in the tech cooperative when</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.970" end="00:12:53.709" style="s2">I&#39;m not a tech person right and it is I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.970" end="00:12:55.870" style="s2">don&#39;t know I have the vision I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.709" end="00:12:58.390" style="s2">know this is what&#39;s happening through me</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.870" end="00:13:00.940" style="s2">and in me so it&#39;s not something I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.390" end="00:13:02.080" style="s2">give a job description to and that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.940" end="00:13:04.740" style="s2">normal when you&#39;re starting a business</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.080" end="00:13:07.470" style="s2">like Elon Musk is the CEO of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.740" end="00:13:09.150" style="s2">of Tesla but what does he actually do</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.470" end="00:13:10.530" style="s2">he&#39;s you know I mean he&#39;s Elon Musk&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.150" end="00:13:13.560" style="s2">different than hiring someone who is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.530" end="00:13:16.200" style="s2">CEO and there&#39;s something there of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.560" end="00:13:18.600" style="s2">every human being is them right like my</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.200" end="00:13:20.340" style="s2">job is to be Jubilee you can&#39;t put that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.600" end="00:13:22.530" style="s2">in a job description even if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.340" end="00:13:24.690" style="s2">many job descriptions I could maybe do</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.530" end="00:13:27.450" style="s2">and so there was something there that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.690" end="00:13:28.920" style="s2">was like ya know I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.450" end="00:13:30.060" style="s2">important I think it&#39;s important notion</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.920" end="00:13:31.380" style="s2">I think it goes even deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.060" end="00:13:33.270" style="s2">though it&#39;s not it&#39;s not even just about</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.380" end="00:13:35.850" style="s2">job description it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.270" end="00:13:40.350" style="s2">your personal narrative if that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.850" end="00:13:42.810" style="s2">too fixed too entrenched then it stifles</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.350" end="00:13:46.740" style="s2">your ability to evolve and change right</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.810" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">and so the getting married to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.740" end="00:13:53.430" style="s2">of who you are is is is it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:54.840" style="s2">dangerous thing right well dangerous is</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.430" end="00:14:00.360" style="s2">maybe the wrong word but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.840" end="00:14:02.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a regressive thing right it&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.360" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">yeah the it&#39;s almost a question it</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.490" end="00:14:07.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want an answer right as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.160" end="00:14:09.960" style="s2">you come to an answer which you&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.620" end="00:14:14.970" style="s2">with and feels in some way final and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.960" end="00:14:20.190" style="s2">definitive then you stop traveling right</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.970" end="00:14:22.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve come to a halt which is like if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.190" end="00:14:24.120" style="s2">label myself something even including a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.170" end="00:14:25.350" style="s2">profession right I&#39;m an engineer then</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.120" end="00:14:28.050" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have a connotation of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.350" end="00:14:29.820" style="s2">that is and I might be leaving living</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.050" end="00:14:33.480" style="s2">into it okay I can&#39;t do that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.820" end="00:14:34.890" style="s2">engineers don&#39;t do that or I could not</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.480" end="00:14:37.890" style="s2">be and just be like well that&#39;s okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.890" end="00:14:41.640" style="s2">an engineer and I still do this and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.890" end="00:14:45.810" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a very nebulous thing feels</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.640" end="00:14:49.080" style="s2">feels worth bringing in here I think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.810" end="00:14:50.760" style="s2">it Daniel who talks about this you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.080" end="00:14:53.280" style="s2">there&#39;s being becoming this this this</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.760" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">you know you are you are what you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.280" end="00:14:59.730" style="s2">but you are also constantly in a state</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:15:03.570" style="s2">of becoming something else right and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.730" end="00:15:05.550" style="s2">so yeah Who I am is also Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.570" end="00:15:09.590" style="s2">becoming in the direction I am heading</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.550" end="00:15:13.830" style="s2">in right is also part of who I am mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.590" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s funny I suddenly think I am a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.830" end="00:15:18.420" style="s2">mythical creature who sometimes pretends</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:27.019" style="s2">to be a cog in a machine in order to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.420" end="00:15:30.089" style="s2">pay the bills there is like this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.019" end="00:15:32.339" style="s2">portion of society where we&#39;re all kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.089" end="00:15:34.139" style="s2">of stuck at home and this is my normal</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.339" end="00:15:35.399" style="s2">this is ninety percent of my normal</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.139" end="00:15:37.079" style="s2">there was still ten percent that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.399" end="00:15:41.699" style="s2">reduced for sure I don&#39;t go to cohousing</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.079" end="00:15:43.170" style="s2">right now but there&#39;s a openness that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.699" end="00:15:45.779" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re stuck in your own</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.170" end="00:15:47.250" style="s2">house and I&#39;m seeing it happen in on</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.779" end="00:15:48.779" style="s2">social media people are like can we just</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.250" end="00:15:50.370" style="s2">agree to like never go back to wearing</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.779" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">bras like why am I even putting on</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.370" end="00:15:54.630" style="s2">makeup and I&#39;m like both you can right</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:56.430" style="s2">you can get dressed up to the night I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.630" end="00:15:58.829" style="s2">can tell you the number of times my kid</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.430" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">comes out her ballet outfit or a full</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.829" end="00:16:03.269" style="s2">dress I&#39;m like you know we&#39;re just a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:04.949" style="s2">knit but that&#39;s what she wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.269" end="00:16:07.949" style="s2">what she wants to look like whereas me</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.949" end="00:16:09.570" style="s2">I&#39;m like pajamas all day every day giant</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.949" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">onesie anything I&#39;m comfortable in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.570" end="00:16:13.500" style="s2">because it&#39;s my space and I and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:16.230" style="s2">that we start to give ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.500" end="00:16:18.690" style="s2">permission or when we are around</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.230" end="00:16:21.690" style="s2">ourselves as the number one person more</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.690" end="00:16:23.850" style="s2">often that it&#39;s it&#39;s not the bras or</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.690" end="00:16:27.149" style="s2">makeup or dressing up as bad or good</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.850" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">it&#39;s is it you what do you do when</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.149" end="00:16:32.220" style="s2">you&#39;re by yourself how do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:34.470" style="s2">appear like is there a reason to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.220" end="00:16:38.310" style="s2">dressed up or is there not to be by</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.470" end="00:16:39.899" style="s2">yourself well it really is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.310" end="00:16:42.300" style="s2">interesting too because the the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.899" end="00:16:44.610" style="s2">it you familiar with the notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.300" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">non-newtonian fluid you know like a wet</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.610" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">sand or the starch compound like when</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:51.240" style="s2">it&#39;s under stress it&#39;s it acts like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:53.220" style="s2">solid but when it&#39;s relaxed it acts like</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.240" end="00:16:55.949" style="s2">a liquid and there&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.220" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">the more that I act like the more that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.949" end="00:17:01.769" style="s2">perceive myself and act like I&#39;m a cog</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">in the machine the more they feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.769" end="00:17:05.309" style="s2">have a rigidity that actually functions</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">as a cog in the machine it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.309" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">yeah my parts interleaved with the parts</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.220" end="00:17:12.929" style="s2">of a social structure in a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:15.059" style="s2">actually allows the social structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.929" end="00:17:18.329" style="s2">some external influence to move through</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.059" end="00:17:21.980" style="s2">me in a way that I can then benefit but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.329" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">as soon as that pressure stops it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.980" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">the the it&#39;s like it&#39;s I say it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:29.700" style="s2">of like a slime mold right under the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:31.830" style="s2">right conditions it&#39;s doing something</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.700" end="00:17:32.730" style="s2">it&#39;s striving it looks like it it looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.830" end="00:17:34.919" style="s2">like an amoeba</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.730" end="00:17:37.380" style="s2">and then when those conditions fail and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.919" end="00:17:39.870" style="s2">moisture level falls it turns into dust</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.380" end="00:17:46.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s interesting Who</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.870" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">am I when I don&#39;t have the confining</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.350" end="00:17:56.520" style="s2">competing pressurized container that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.100" end="00:17:58.049" style="s2">holds that help yeah yeah yeah just as</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.520" end="00:18:00.500" style="s2">you talk about because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.049" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">about a cog right which is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.500" end="00:18:05.400" style="s2">impersonal and does the set all it does</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:07.049" style="s2">is go round and round and round and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.400" end="00:18:09.900" style="s2">round and round right and it does what</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.049" end="00:18:11.370" style="s2">it does entirely because the cogs next</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.900" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">we&#39;re also going round and round and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.370" end="00:18:15.150" style="s2">driving it in it&#39;s driving the next one</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:17.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s very mechanical and very boring</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.150" end="00:18:19.590" style="s2">and very soul-destroying kind of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.190" end="00:18:23.730" style="s2">that that image as to it right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.590" end="00:18:27.419" style="s2">wondering what an equivalent imagery</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.730" end="00:18:31.620" style="s2">would be for because in a sense I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.419" end="00:18:34.919" style="s2">however evolved and beautiful the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.620" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">Society is we are in a sense still cogs</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.919" end="00:18:39.750" style="s2">in a machine right we are completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:41.549" style="s2">dependent on those around us and they to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.750" end="00:18:43.140" style="s2">some extent depend on what we do right</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.549" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">we&#39;re that the connection between what</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.140" end="00:18:47.850" style="s2">we think is not lost but it&#39;s not a hog</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:50.340" style="s2">type thing there is there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.850" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">nature to it I&#39;m wondering what imagery</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.340" end="00:18:55.410" style="s2">would fit that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:19:00.299" style="s2">interconnectedness that isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.410" end="00:19:01.950" style="s2">restrictive mm-hmm and I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.299" end="00:19:03.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know what your wording was David</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.950" end="00:19:07.650" style="s2">but like the corn started to say non</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.210" end="00:19:08.760" style="s2">Newtonian physics and because yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.650" end="00:19:10.710" style="s2">COG when you were talking about I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.760" end="00:19:12.360" style="s2">and you can&#39;t not be a cog right if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.710" end="00:19:13.799" style="s2">are like I&#39;m not gonna have this spoke</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.360" end="00:19:15.299" style="s2">anymore I&#39;m gonna be bigger I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.799" end="00:19:17.370" style="s2">smaller you don&#39;t fit into the Machine</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.299" end="00:19:19.740" style="s2">and the Machine can&#39;t run and everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.370" end="00:19:21.929" style="s2">breaks down we can&#39;t be individual cogs</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.740" end="00:19:24.690" style="s2">right we can&#39;t reinvent ourselves as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.929" end="00:19:26.220" style="s2">cog and remain a cog at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.690" end="00:19:28.620" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the cornstarch</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.220" end="00:19:30.330" style="s2">something about that like the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.620" end="00:19:32.190" style="s2">makes that you can say you know what how</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.330" end="00:19:33.929" style="s2">to try to be this calm today I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.190" end="00:19:35.640" style="s2">try and like do this one but I might not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.929" end="00:19:36.929" style="s2">I might not hold that shape under and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.640" end="00:19:41.210" style="s2">then we&#39;ll see how it runs and we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.929" end="00:19:41.210" style="s2">who can who can fit into this to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.680" end="00:19:47.930" style="s2">this pressure applied when when</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.420" end="00:19:50.700" style="s2">something is required of it its</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.930" end="00:19:52.920" style="s2">structures itself right it creates a it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.700" end="00:19:54.450" style="s2">creates a rigid structure in response to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.920" end="00:19:55.530" style="s2">that and then when it when that is no</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.450" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">longer required</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.530" end="00:20:00.930" style="s2">it becomes right and those things are no</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:02.490" style="s2">longer fixed in position they&#39;re free to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.930" end="00:20:03.960" style="s2">move around again but then the next time</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.490" end="00:20:06.600" style="s2">the system is under stress they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.960" end="00:20:08.910" style="s2">required to once again line up and get</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.600" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">into position and and and and and be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.910" end="00:20:14.730" style="s2">cog again so there&#39;s fluidity between</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:17.130" style="s2">being cog and being non cog I mean I</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.570" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">take over to the like no this is what</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.580" end="00:27:29.090" style="s2">this is the best we can do right now for</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:32.389" style="s2">our society it&#39;s the best we got going</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.090" end="00:27:36.710" style="s2">on to know what to do and there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.389" end="00:27:38.990" style="s2">cost that comes from everything we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.710" end="00:27:40.879" style="s2">we&#39;ve sewed that we&#39;re now reaping our</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.879" end="00:27:45.619" style="s2">and our authoritative even if they are</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.619" end="00:27:49.070" style="s2">decide things and we follow or we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.179" end="00:27:50.809" style="s2">only eroded that trust and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.070" end="00:27:54.799" style="s2">follow them anymore and nor should we</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.809" end="00:28:00.529" style="s2">except for right now like this is really</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.799" end="00:28:02.860" style="s2">weird flipping of like the enemy becomes</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.529" end="00:28:05.179" style="s2">people who don&#39;t stand on your side</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.860" end="00:28:06.590" style="s2">people who are not social distancing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.179" end="00:28:08.749" style="s2">my case or from them people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.590" end="00:28:10.070" style="s2">social distancing right like how dare</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.749" end="00:28:11.779" style="s2">you stay in your house you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.070" end="00:28:13.309" style="s2">problem like you don&#39;t understand you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.779" end="00:28:14.869" style="s2">gonna destroy the economy I&#39;m like well</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.309" end="00:28:20.360" style="s2">the economy was destroying itself anyway</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.869" end="00:28:22.100" style="s2">so this is just a faster kindergarten</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.360" end="00:28:24.619" style="s2">apocalypse like something that we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.100" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">test out but the virus itself isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.619" end="00:28:29.299" style="s2">the virus we can&#39;t argue with it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:30.379" style="s2">whatever it is whatever it&#39;s biology is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.299" end="00:28:31.080" style="s2">is what we&#39;re gonna have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.379" end="00:28:34.289" style="s2">and deal with</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.080" end="00:28:36.269" style="s2">as a society and as as human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.289" end="00:28:39.720" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing we can do about that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.269" end="00:28:41.700" style="s2">can&#39;t change it it is interesting there</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.720" end="00:28:44.820" style="s2">was a video taken in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.700" end="00:28:47.100" style="s2">not long ago which went which meant sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.820" end="00:28:48.629" style="s2">of semi viral of the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.100" end="00:28:50.519" style="s2">David was just mentioning someone going</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.629" end="00:28:52.169" style="s2">around a hospital and going through Ward</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.519" end="00:28:54.690" style="s2">after Ward after ward and just taking</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.169" end="00:28:56.730" style="s2">film of empty beds and this guy arrested</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.690" end="00:28:58.470" style="s2">he was he was put in jail apparently</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.730" end="00:29:00.019" style="s2">didn&#39;t know anything about as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.470" end="00:29:05.759" style="s2">can tell but was apparently put in jail</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.019" end="00:29:09.720" style="s2">and so yeah it is it is odd isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.759" end="00:29:12.659" style="s2">that there are all of these empty beds</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.720" end="00:29:14.220" style="s2">and yet this narrative of we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.659" end="00:29:15.210" style="s2">to overwhelm the Health Service it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.220" end="00:29:16.619" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s anywhere near</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.210" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">overwhelm you know what I mean and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.619" end="00:29:20.279" style="s2">and again just like that I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.350" style="s2">what&#39;s right what&#39;s wrong but it is see</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.279" end="00:29:31.049" style="s2">it is seemingly impossible to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.350" end="00:29:33.809" style="s2">of that paradox right so just that just</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.049" end="00:29:36.210" style="s2">to be clear you know and I saw someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.809" end="00:29:37.950" style="s2">who gave a really good description of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.210" end="00:29:42.570" style="s2">possible explanation for why there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.950" end="00:29:44.309" style="s2">empty hospital beds one so just this</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.570" end="00:29:47.249" style="s2">isn&#39;t to say this is the truth but this</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.309" end="00:29:48.450" style="s2">is just a good counter narrative that to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.249" end="00:29:50.340" style="s2">be added in right</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.450" end="00:29:52.529" style="s2">just because you CT hospital beds does</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.340" end="00:29:55.799" style="s2">that mean that there&#39;s no virus well no</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.529" end="00:29:57.480" style="s2">remember right now the numbers are still</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.799" end="00:29:59.090" style="s2">the number of deaths or what and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.480" end="00:30:03.059" style="s2">hundred and fifty thousand range</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.090" end="00:30:06.179" style="s2">globally something like that whereas</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.059" end="00:30:09.059" style="s2">last week it was 70,000 so if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.179" end="00:30:11.429" style="s2">numbers can be believed we&#39;re doubling</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.059" end="00:30:14.070" style="s2">and a week the number of deaths that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.429" end="00:30:17.940" style="s2">given three weeks of isolation so far</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.070" end="00:30:19.529" style="s2">right so and if I look at the chart if</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.940" end="00:30:22.100" style="s2">it can be believed it&#39;s still heading up</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.529" end="00:30:25.049" style="s2">but it&#39;s still a hundred thousand deaths</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.100" end="00:30:26.999" style="s2">150,000 deaths globally it&#39;s still not</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.049" end="00:30:29.190" style="s2">that much it&#39;s heading in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.999" end="00:30:31.980" style="s2">and an exponential growth that that will</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.190" end="00:30:33.720" style="s2">become a problem at some point and given</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.980" end="00:30:37.830" style="s2">that it makes sense that hospitals are</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.720" end="00:30:41.049" style="s2">saying let&#39;s not put any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.830" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">elective surgeries anything that can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.049" end="00:30:45.130" style="s2">cleaned off the slates works we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:47.830" style="s2">making sure that we have the hospital is</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.130" end="00:30:50.950" style="s2">as empty as possible to prepare for this</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.830" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">coming onslaught it kind of like so if I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.950" end="00:30:56.440" style="s2">think of it in the way of sitting on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:58.660" style="s2">beach in Indonesia during that during</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.440" end="00:31:00.100" style="s2">the tidal wave hey well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.660" end="00:31:01.660" style="s2">something happen out there but the beach</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.100" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">is fine I&#39;m cool</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.660" end="00:31:06.010" style="s2">what&#39;s the problem well the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:08.470" style="s2">that thing is heading this way and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.010" end="00:31:10.750" style="s2">getting bigger by the moment and just</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.470" end="00:31:13.179" style="s2">standing here because the beach is fine</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.750" end="00:31:17.320" style="s2">is a really bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.179" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s difficult to the context wait a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.320" end="00:31:22.630" style="s2">minute how big is that how fast is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:26.410" style="s2">moving what does that mean when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.630" end="00:31:28.510" style="s2">actually here at my doorstep when do I</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.410" end="00:31:30.340" style="s2">need to actually say this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.510" end="00:31:33.100" style="s2">need to deal with rather than oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.340" end="00:31:35.230" style="s2">something I can ignore right I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.100" end="00:31:37.450" style="s2">there&#39;s some validity in that but at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.230" end="00:31:39.090" style="s2">same time they&#39;ve also been plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.450" end="00:31:41.500" style="s2">reports and plenty of videos of how</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.090" end="00:31:43.330" style="s2">overwhelmed people are in the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.500" end="00:31:45.010" style="s2">system right you know doing 18-hour</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.330" end="00:31:46.690" style="s2">shifts you know not in sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.010" end="00:31:48.100" style="s2">protective equipment and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.690" end="00:31:49.540" style="s2">rushed off their feet and we haven&#39;t got</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.100" end="00:31:51.040" style="s2">enough beds to put people and the IC</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.540" end="00:31:53.320" style="s2">user overflowing we&#39;ve got people in</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.040" end="00:31:55.330" style="s2">corridors and bla bla bla bla bla right</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.320" end="00:31:59.830" style="s2">so how does that fit in you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.330" end="00:32:02.049" style="s2">mean I think it is it&#39;s it&#39;s like if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.830" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">think about it as war or think about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.049" end="00:32:07.330" style="s2">you that analogy when one nation is at</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:09.460" style="s2">war with another or like America is with</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.330" end="00:32:11.380" style="s2">everyone over like with Iraq and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.460" end="00:32:14.020" style="s2">Afghanistan you have different bases</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.380" end="00:32:15.820" style="s2">just cuz one base is overwhelmed and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.020" end="00:32:17.590" style="s2">a fight doesn&#39;t mean every base at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.820" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">same time is and it doesn&#39;t mean those</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.590" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">bases are gonna up and leave either</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:23.230" style="s2">they&#39;re there in case there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:25.510" style="s2">outbreak right there of war of fighting</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.230" end="00:32:27.340" style="s2">and if things escalate they have their</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.510" end="00:32:29.500" style="s2">people on the ground and that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.340" end="00:32:33.400" style="s2">were treating this like a war we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.500" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve um people are on the ready</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.400" end="00:32:37.299" style="s2">they&#39;re on the ready for this this tidal</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:39.580" style="s2">wave of patients that may or may not</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.299" end="00:32:41.500" style="s2">come because we it&#39;s based on math and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.580" end="00:32:43.690" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a two-week cycle it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.500" end="00:32:46.059" style="s2">well the people that are incubating it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.690" end="00:32:47.470" style="s2">right now are possibly the ones you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.059" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">gonna be on the respirators in two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.470" end="00:32:50.509" style="s2">and then when they&#39;re on the respirators</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:52.099" style="s2">in two weeks and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.509" end="00:32:53.539" style="s2">passed it on to everybody else&#39;s them</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.099" end="00:32:54.889" style="s2">the people in the respirators in another</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.539" end="00:32:57.589" style="s2">two weeks now there&#39;s room for them</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.889" end="00:33:00.529" style="s2">because if this exponential growth this</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.589" end="00:33:01.999" style="s2">is the problem with with any central</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.529" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">authority our government is taking</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.999" end="00:33:06.019" style="s2">action is like you know there were</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:08.239" style="s2">critiquing Trump understandably because</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.019" end="00:33:12.409" style="s2">he didn&#39;t shut it down soon enough but</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.239" end="00:33:14.149" style="s2">if you had shut it down in January we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.409" end="00:33:15.739" style="s2">already critical of our governments who</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.149" end="00:33:17.539" style="s2">shut it down too early right like wait</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.739" end="00:33:18.709" style="s2">our hospitals are empty and then when</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.539" end="00:33:20.570" style="s2">because hospitals aren&#39;t people like</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.709" end="00:33:23.449" style="s2">well then we need to leave our houses no</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.570" end="00:33:25.639" style="s2">bridge alone this is like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.449" end="00:33:27.649" style="s2">calm before the storm or it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.639" end="00:33:29.809" style="s2">the calm remains and we did our job or</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.649" end="00:33:31.459" style="s2">there&#39;s a storm and we need to stay here</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.809" end="00:33:33.229" style="s2">well that&#39;s happening but the health</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.459" end="00:33:36.499" style="s2">care workers that are overwhelmed in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.229" end="00:33:38.239" style="s2">hospitals that are overwhelmed there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.499" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">ways to deal with that and move</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.239" end="00:33:43.190" style="s2">personnel around and move and and get</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:45.349" style="s2">those things ready but it always just</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.190" end="00:33:47.479" style="s2">seems to me there&#39;s a disservice in and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.349" end="00:33:49.249" style="s2">I get why we do it but in stopping</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.479" end="00:33:50.809" style="s2">information and putting that guy in jail</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.249" end="00:33:52.699" style="s2">because he took because that information</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.809" end="00:33:53.809" style="s2">being out there means everyone&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.699" end="00:33:55.129" style="s2">how why are we in our houses we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.809" end="00:33:56.629" style="s2">leave and you don&#39;t want people to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.129" end="00:33:57.889" style="s2">that but but then when you put him in</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.629" end="00:34:00.319" style="s2">jail everyone&#39;s like wait they&#39;re lying</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.889" end="00:34:03.109" style="s2">to us they&#39;re not letting us know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.319" end="00:34:04.819" style="s2">truth and the truth is this is a dick</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.109" end="00:34:06.289" style="s2">this is a disease we don&#39;t understand we</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.819" end="00:34:07.999" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the implications of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.289" end="00:34:09.470" style="s2">and we&#39;re learning and we&#39;re figuring it</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.999" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">out we&#39;re trying to get capacity to deal</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.470" end="00:34:14.359" style="s2">with all the patients before they arrive</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:16.069" style="s2">and our hospitals are empty like but</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.359" end="00:34:18.409" style="s2">like some are overwhelmed and some</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.069" end="00:34:19.879" style="s2">aren&#39;t and say like this is the truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.409" end="00:34:22.069" style="s2">both of those things are truth but we</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.879" end="00:34:23.149" style="s2">know it&#39;s a pretty small country if</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.069" end="00:34:24.349" style="s2">you&#39;ve got some hospitals are</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.149" end="00:34:26.539" style="s2">overwhelmed and others are not then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.349" end="00:34:28.970" style="s2">should be easily able to spread the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.539" end="00:34:31.009" style="s2">loads a little bit more I mean I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.970" end="00:34:32.809" style="s2">get that that&#39;s not the case everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.009" end="00:34:34.309" style="s2">right but certainly in the UK you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.809" end="00:34:35.720" style="s2">this as I say is a pretty small country</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.309" end="00:34:37.940" style="s2">with lots and lots to be packed into it</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.720" end="00:34:39.859" style="s2">this would be pretty easy so again that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.940" end="00:34:41.389" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really stack up you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.859" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">mean and so there is as you just said</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.389" end="00:34:45.289" style="s2">there is this sense of I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:47.269" style="s2">told the truth what are you withholding</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.289" end="00:34:51.019" style="s2">or what are you lying about or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.269" end="00:34:54.019" style="s2">and and yeah the it undermines trust</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.019" end="00:34:57.259" style="s2">which you know has been a long process</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.019" end="00:34:59.329" style="s2">so here&#39;s here&#39;s a heart right if if</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.259" end="00:35:03.670" style="s2">there is a fiction to the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.329" end="00:35:03.670" style="s2">right one we&#39;re being lied to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.990" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">or two it&#39;s just a global history loose</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.750" end="00:35:13.530" style="s2">nation right both of those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:18.210" style="s2">inconceivable in a way right if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.530" end="00:35:20.010" style="s2">just like we think we&#39;re dying but</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.210" end="00:35:22.110" style="s2">really we&#39;re not this isn&#39;t that this</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.010" end="00:35:24.810" style="s2">isn&#39;t a catastrophic event it just</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.110" end="00:35:26.520" style="s2">somehow because of the rapidity of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.810" end="00:35:28.950" style="s2">because of the infectiousness of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.520" end="00:35:30.900" style="s2">because of our own internal fragile</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.950" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">state this is kind of like waking up in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.900" end="00:35:34.200" style="s2">the middle of the night thinking you see</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">a stranger in in the corner of the room</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.200" end="00:35:39.810" style="s2">and freaking out my body reacts as if</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:41.340" style="s2">there&#39;s an intruder I turn on the light</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.810" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">oh it&#39;s not an intruder it&#39;s a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.340" end="00:35:47.160" style="s2">laundry I didn&#39;t okay everything comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:49.710" style="s2">down but if I if I can&#39;t make out the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.160" end="00:35:51.180" style="s2">distinction if I have to react right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.710" end="00:35:52.410" style="s2">afraid to turn on the light I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.180" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">have to treat it like an intruder I</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.410" end="00:35:57.690" style="s2">better get my gun you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">at what point just Huson nation give way</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.690" end="00:36:02.190" style="s2">to know this isn&#39;t the case so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.750" style="s2">one side it&#39;s who it&#39;s a global</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.190" end="00:36:05.460" style="s2">hallucination that we&#39;re all reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.750" end="00:36:07.710" style="s2">in the same way and our response is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.460" end="00:36:12.090" style="s2">causing us to exacerbate the response</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.710" end="00:36:14.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a chain reaction kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.090" end="00:36:17.130" style="s2">of hallucination the other option if</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.850" end="00:36:19.890" style="s2">it&#39;s if there isn&#39;t truly if this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.130" end="00:36:22.020" style="s2">truly a pandemic that requires this all</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.890" end="00:36:26.700" style="s2">the response is that governments around</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.020" end="00:36:29.850" style="s2">the world are cooperating what wait a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.700" end="00:36:33.300" style="s2">minute can it possibly be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.850" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">China and Russia and Italy and France</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.300" end="00:36:37.850" style="s2">and the United States and North Korea</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:41.640" style="s2">and South Korea are cooperating to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.850" end="00:36:43.950" style="s2">convey a message of global pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.640" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">shutting down and hiding the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.950" end="00:36:50.190" style="s2">the hospitals are empty in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">what is this a one-world government like</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.190" end="00:36:55.320" style="s2">a lot of people are saying or is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:59.960" style="s2">really you know what we&#39;re at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.320" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">the notion of patriarchal top-down</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.960" end="00:37:05.640" style="s2">societal structure that can operate from</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:08.550" style="s2">rules and justice and we need to now</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.640" end="00:37:11.190" style="s2">rely on our neighbors more than some</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.550" end="00:37:13.500" style="s2">central authority to take care of it if</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.190" end="00:37:15.869" style="s2">that&#39;s the case again is that a response</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.500" end="00:37:17.870" style="s2">from the bottom up or from the top down</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.869" end="00:37:21.170" style="s2">or is it really</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.870" end="00:37:26.570" style="s2">kind of a an but isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.170" end="00:37:28.580" style="s2">hallucination and as as much as it feels</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.570" end="00:37:33.560" style="s2">like I don&#39;t like the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.580" end="00:37:35.780" style="s2">hallucinating in some real way when I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.560" end="00:37:39.170" style="s2">study neuroscience and look at it that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.780" end="00:37:44.060" style="s2">is all I have to go on every perception</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.170" end="00:37:46.070" style="s2">I had is my body&#39;s entire system using</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.060" end="00:37:47.930" style="s2">my eyes and my ears and my senses and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.070" end="00:37:52.490" style="s2">everything telling me what am I seeing</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.930" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">and there are times when I see I look</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.490" end="00:37:57.650" style="s2">outside and I see that just looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:37:59.240" style="s2">calm beach and I and then when I really</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.650" end="00:38:02.990" style="s2">understand what it is no that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.240" end="00:38:04.930" style="s2">tsunami this is a problem right and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.990" end="00:38:07.490" style="s2">lot of something like the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.930" end="00:38:09.770" style="s2">difficult for us to perceive this is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.490" end="00:38:11.420" style="s2">exponential event I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.770" end="00:38:13.220" style="s2">recognize an exponential event I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.420" end="00:38:15.800" style="s2">heard of them I heard of Moore&#39;s law and</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.220" end="00:38:17.510" style="s2">see what that looks like over a 50-year</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.800" end="00:38:20.690" style="s2">period I don&#39;t know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.510" end="00:38:24.890" style="s2">a three-month period yeah and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.690" end="00:38:27.050" style="s2">big is that people don&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.890" end="00:38:28.370" style="s2">mathematics of exponential growth and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.050" end="00:38:32.510" style="s2">know this time and time again from like</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.370" end="00:38:34.490" style="s2">those rentals of like you know we double</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.510" end="00:38:36.080" style="s2">the population every 24 hours at what</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.490" end="00:38:38.390" style="s2">point in the fee tree you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.080" end="00:38:40.910" style="s2">world&#39;s absolutely full on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.390" end="00:38:43.550" style="s2">100th day when is it half full and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.910" end="00:38:46.580" style="s2">like well the mad 99th day look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.550" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">like this is how people don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.580" end="00:38:50.300" style="s2">and so they compared it to the flu and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:51.980" style="s2">they compared to all these things like</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.300" end="00:38:54.350" style="s2">look there&#39;s less deaths yes but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.980" end="00:38:55.580" style="s2">with it running rampant that&#39;s with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.350" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">it burning out through the population</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.580" end="00:39:00.410" style="s2">there is something when you were you</p>

<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:34.850" style="s2">means there&#39;s people in every city who</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.410" end="00:39:38.060" style="s2">wants to stay who want to stay inside</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.850" end="00:39:40.070" style="s2">for the good of health and safety of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.060" end="00:39:42.500" style="s2">nurses and doctors and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.070" end="00:39:45.110" style="s2">like this is stupid this is too far for</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.500" end="00:39:47.960" style="s2">destroying our economy and the reason we</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.110" end="00:39:50.750" style="s2">can&#39;t do both is because we&#39;re all inter</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.960" end="00:39:52.220" style="s2">dispersed but if you could say okay you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.750" end="00:39:53.510" style="s2">want to go out and about instead of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.220" end="00:39:58.250" style="s2">going to jail great you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.510" end="00:39:59.300" style="s2">Calgary Calgary is the city but cuz he</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.250" end="00:40:00.920" style="s2">had of course up in it and it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.300" end="00:40:05.570" style="s2">be Calgary be a better City than that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.920" end="00:40:07.730" style="s2">but like right for the next three months</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.570" end="00:40:10.010" style="s2">you can walk about freely in this city</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.730" end="00:40:11.540" style="s2">go ahead get crota pirates don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.010" end="00:40:14.630" style="s2">there are as a biologist there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.540" end="00:40:17.080" style="s2">things about this that don&#39;t that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.630" end="00:40:20.150" style="s2">weird that like the the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.080" end="00:40:24.140" style="s2">isolated tribes in in nor in South</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.150" end="00:40:26.600" style="s2">America are getting this from like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.140" end="00:40:29.990" style="s2">miners it looks like but their youth are</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.600" end="00:40:32.180" style="s2">dying from it unlike the rest of us well</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.990" end="00:40:34.270" style="s2">that&#39;s weird because if it&#39;s new to our</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.180" end="00:40:37.550" style="s2">bodies and it&#39;s new to theirs it</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.270" end="00:40:39.110" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t affect us differently but if</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.550" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve come and contacted with before</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.110" end="00:40:41.930" style="s2">before and we just didn&#39;t really realize</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:43.820" style="s2">cuz you treat it like the flu and there</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.930" end="00:40:46.570" style="s2">was no reason to test it and we how</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.820" end="00:40:49.190" style="s2">about like it&#39;s weird that that their</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.570" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">teenagers are dying and our children and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.190" end="00:40:56.270" style="s2">teenagers are there&#39;s some of them but</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:58.220" style="s2">not at that same rate or is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.270" end="00:41:00.020" style="s2">live in close proximity and we&#39;ve dealt</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.220" end="00:41:02.180" style="s2">with the flu and cold so many times and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.020" end="00:41:04.670" style="s2">maybe they haven&#39;t I don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.180" end="00:41:06.170" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff here that&#39;s like yes if</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.670" end="00:41:07.910" style="s2">we&#39;re not open about this if I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.170" end="00:41:09.830" style="s2">trust my governments and I can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.910" end="00:41:11.420" style="s2">then I get why people are saying we</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.830" end="00:41:13.100" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t stay inside I get our</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.420" end="00:41:14.780" style="s2">governments I&#39;m the first one to say our</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.100" end="00:41:17.240" style="s2">governments are not capable of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.780" end="00:41:20.060" style="s2">with anything complex there&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.240" end="00:41:21.740" style="s2">best we have right now and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.060" end="00:41:23.050" style="s2">still like this in six months yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.740" end="00:41:25.370" style="s2">need to figure it out we need to like</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.050" end="00:41:29.060" style="s2">figure out how to rise up from within</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.370" end="00:41:32.030" style="s2">our own apartments take back control and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.060" end="00:41:33.650" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely doable just the only</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.030" end="00:41:35.540" style="s2">thing we know is to pour out into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.650" end="00:41:37.160" style="s2">streets don&#39;t do that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.540" end="00:41:39.890" style="s2">clearly not the thing we do during</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.160" end="00:41:43.270" style="s2">academic but it&#39;s what people know is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.890" end="00:41:43.270" style="s2">available I&#39;m just gonna get more water</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.250" end="00:41:50.510" style="s2">you know I think it&#39;s pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.450" end="00:41:52.430" style="s2">separate the media clamoring for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.510" end="00:41:55.400" style="s2">course of action from government policy</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.430" end="00:41:57.350" style="s2">these days right I mean as soon as the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.400" end="00:41:58.820" style="s2">media does unite behind this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.350" end="00:42:01.070" style="s2">ought to be doing governments fall into</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.820" end="00:42:03.890" style="s2">line right because they can&#39;t they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.070" end="00:42:05.150" style="s2">stand in the face of public opinion they</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.890" end="00:42:06.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have the capacity to do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.150" end="00:42:09.260" style="s2">obviously they have to get elected so</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.680" end="00:42:12.590" style="s2">yeah I mean I I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.260" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">a pretty much fundamental thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.590" end="00:42:16.610" style="s2">can client your flag in is that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:20.420" style="s2">cannot trust governments right and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.610" end="00:42:22.820" style="s2">you know even if they are acting mostly</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.420" end="00:42:24.500" style="s2">in good faith during this coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.820" end="00:42:27.110" style="s2">and doing what they think is best for</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.500" end="00:42:29.030" style="s2">the population you know overall on</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.110" end="00:42:29.510" style="s2">balance given the of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.030" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.510" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">you still can&#39;t trust them you still</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.690" style="s2">can&#39;t trust them and you know as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:37.970" style="s2">the emergency is over they&#39;ll they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.690" end="00:42:40.070" style="s2">back to their old ways again so yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.970" end="00:42:42.980" style="s2">have a great deal of sympathy for people</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.070" end="00:42:44.750" style="s2">who don&#39;t trust the advice of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.980" end="00:42:46.370" style="s2">government just based on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.750" end="00:42:51.470" style="s2">you can&#39;t trust the government</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.370" end="00:42:55.370" style="s2">so it&#39;s fair enough it&#39;s fair enough now</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.470" end="00:42:58.910" style="s2">you&#39;re muted muted cutely thank you fix</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.370" end="00:43:00.830" style="s2">that jury after this pandemic what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.910" end="00:43:03.140" style="s2">need to be looking at is this trust and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.830" end="00:43:05.750" style="s2">how can we design an information census</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.140" end="00:43:07.340" style="s2">or so that we can trust because if the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.750" end="00:43:09.620" style="s2">media is not it and it&#39;s the best we</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.340" end="00:43:12.170" style="s2">have if the government&#39;s the the only</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.620" end="00:43:14.780" style="s2">option we have yet it&#39;s not even close</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.170" end="00:43:15.580" style="s2">to adequate to deal with these complex</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.780" end="00:43:18.500" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.580" end="00:43:20.570" style="s2">what can we create to do that in their</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.500" end="00:43:22.970" style="s2">absence like I mean you saw it happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.570" end="00:43:24.530" style="s2">in America Ebola okay lord president in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.970" end="00:43:26.270" style="s2">house had told us to stay inside but we</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.530" end="00:43:28.100" style="s2">are gonna stay inside like a lot of me</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.270" end="00:43:30.650" style="s2">this would be way worse if people had</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.100" end="00:43:31.910" style="s2">listened to their president some of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.650" end="00:43:33.860" style="s2">did some of them still are they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.910" end="00:43:36.830" style="s2">having some church church services and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.860" end="00:43:38.720" style="s2">stuff in sight in some of the places but</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.830" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">if they had just continued business as</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:42.530" style="s2">usual until Trump actually caught up it</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">would be way worse than it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.530" end="00:43:51.080" style="s2">and yeah anyway to redevelop a system of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:55.160" style="s2">trust that we can trust because we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.080" end="00:43:58.070" style="s2">see transparency so you know so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.160" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">interesting because if I think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.070" end="00:44:02.360" style="s2">you know the Charles Eisenstein piece</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:05.390" style="s2">and his discussion recently about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.360" end="00:44:06.740" style="s2">and the coming cross words is evident</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.390" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">like we can feel it in their bones</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.740" end="00:44:12.350" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a point time when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:15.170" style="s2">had to change the narrative and and yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.350" end="00:44:16.730" style="s2">is it y2k I know that didn&#39;t happen okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.170" end="00:44:18.890" style="s2">that&#39;s weird okay this is a 2007</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.730" end="00:44:20.330" style="s2">financial collapse right to make Clark</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.890" end="00:44:23.720" style="s2">lapse nope that didn&#39;t happen either</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.330" end="00:44:26.120" style="s2">okay then it&#39;s something it&#39;s it&#39;s which</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.720" end="00:44:29.360" style="s2">one is it and then suddenly it shows up</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.120" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s like there&#39;s something like if</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.360" end="00:44:34.460" style="s2">we as a collective even if none of us is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:36.890" style="s2">individuals but the collective know</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.460" end="00:44:39.770" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to respond to this Center we</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.890" end="00:44:42.550" style="s2">have to shift the focus so I think of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.770" end="00:44:46.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a model in my mind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.550" end="00:44:49.610" style="s2">of a tower that&#39;s built straight up</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.490" end="00:44:51.590" style="s2">right it it&#39;s built on conditional</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.610" end="00:44:54.500" style="s2">architecture and it it can go very tall</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.590" end="00:44:57.470" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s very unstable from</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.500" end="00:45:01.460" style="s2">from lateral forces right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.470" end="00:45:04.310" style="s2">fragile or you can build a dome right a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.460" end="00:45:07.100" style="s2">geodesic dome has the weight distributed</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.310" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">throughout it we&#39;ve been operating with</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.100" end="00:45:11.210" style="s2">the tower model right the top-down this</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:15.020" style="s2">this fragile thing and it&#39;s to the point</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.210" end="00:45:16.490" style="s2">now where realistically whether you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.020" end="00:45:18.350" style="s2">physicist or an economist or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.490" end="00:45:21.410" style="s2">politician you can start to see this</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.350" end="00:45:23.960" style="s2">thing is this thing is wobbly I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.410" end="00:45:27.890" style="s2">is it wouldn&#39;t take very much to knock</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.960" end="00:45:29.810" style="s2">it over and the only way to distribute</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.890" end="00:45:32.750" style="s2">that is to figure out how to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.810" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">your neighbor more I don&#39;t know how you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.750" end="00:45:35.270" style="s2">make a transition it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:37.970" style="s2">questions that have been asking myself</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.270" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">is how would we make a transition from</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.970" end="00:45:43.340" style="s2">one mode to the next I can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:45.260" style="s2">how to collapse a tower into that mode</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.340" end="00:45:47.090" style="s2">but I did watch a video that was just a</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.090" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">using a tower as though as that mode</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.970" end="00:45:54.440" style="s2">right so it&#39;s in some at some point if</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:57.050" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever worked on a G it is dumb</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.440" end="00:45:59.570" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of an interesting exercise to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.050" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">do because there&#39;s one part where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.570" end="00:46:02.390" style="s2">all floppy and then you start to connect</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:05.270" style="s2">the pieces together and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.390" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">the rigidity of the pieces give it it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.270" end="00:46:08.600" style="s2">has there&#39;s a point at which when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:11.030" style="s2">putting the pieces in place it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.600" end="00:46:12.130" style="s2">pops it sort of defies gravity because</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.030" end="00:46:15.940" style="s2">that tends</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.130" end="00:46:17.670" style="s2">that gives that whole structure a</p>

<p begin="00:46:17.670" end="00:46:25.510" style="s2">since looks magical it&#39;s not it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.800" end="00:46:29.620" style="s2">same way it&#39;s a distributed intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.510" end="00:46:33.130" style="s2">to the distributed structure and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.620" end="00:46:35.380" style="s2">relies on each node being connected to</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.380" end="00:46:38.620" style="s2">degree of tension right so that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.620" end="00:46:44.290" style="s2">and the cells in the body a body don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.030" end="00:46:57.580" style="s2">rapidity to real problems so each cell</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.630" end="00:46:59.230" style="s2">has to be paying attention to its</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.580" end="00:47:02.200" style="s2">neighbors and then what happens is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.230" end="00:47:03.850" style="s2">emergent and emerges hallucination about</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.200" end="00:47:07.810" style="s2">what&#39;s the best thing to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.850" end="00:47:11.170" style="s2">moment and and it&#39;s a complex lis</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.810" end="00:47:12.850" style="s2">adaptive emergence that happens over</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.170" end="00:47:14.590" style="s2">time so we learn through this process</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.850" end="00:47:18.130" style="s2">and this is kind of a shock to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.590" end="00:47:20.890" style="s2">system that allows us to say okay huh</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.130" end="00:47:23.770" style="s2">we&#39;re not really we&#39;re fragile but this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.890" end="00:47:27.340" style="s2">is kind of like a baby just learning how</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.770" end="00:47:30.610" style="s2">to use limbs that are at this point just</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.340" end="00:47:32.560" style="s2">what I don&#39;t know what what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.610" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">intention and what is has it related to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.560" end="00:47:38.440" style="s2">this waiting thing in my face hmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:41.340" style="s2">and I think that is that is HUGE I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.440" end="00:47:44.380" style="s2">being able to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.340" end="00:47:46.600" style="s2">dismantle the tower that is there that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.380" end="00:47:48.310" style="s2">we know is wobbly well we build</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.600" end="00:47:50.020" style="s2">something else or first build the thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.310" end="00:47:52.570" style="s2">and then allow it and and how what does</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.020" end="00:47:54.640" style="s2">that what does that process look like</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.570" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">then we have to build the scaffolding we</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:47:59.500" style="s2">have to be able to build the the safety</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:00.820" style="s2">net without relying on who clearly is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.500" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">bad at the safety net just the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.820" end="00:48:07.390" style="s2">government and yet Who am I is very tied</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">and only me I mean just most people is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.390" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">tied to like no weight on this thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:11.980" style="s2">that&#39;s not my job that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:13.150" style="s2">government&#39;s job it&#39;s the government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.980" end="00:48:14.830" style="s2">job to look after me it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.150" end="00:48:16.660" style="s2">government&#39;s job for me to get angry and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.830" end="00:48:19.060" style="s2">tell you how to do things even though</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.660" end="00:48:20.440" style="s2">you&#39;ll never listen so that I eat so</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.060" end="00:48:22.540" style="s2">that there&#39;s like this disconnect like</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.440" end="00:48:23.980" style="s2">you are the parent I&#39;m allowed to yell</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.540" end="00:48:25.570" style="s2">app because you&#39;re doing it wrong as</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.980" end="00:48:29.410" style="s2">opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.570" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">oh wait I&#39;m a grown-up oh we we actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.410" end="00:48:35.320" style="s2">do need to have everybody building that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:37.270" style="s2">geodesic dome everybody within their</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.320" end="00:48:40.330" style="s2">capacity saying what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.270" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">for you I don&#39;t get to dictate what it</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.330" end="00:48:43.060" style="s2">looks like for anyone else but how can</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">we come together as sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.060" end="00:48:48.130" style="s2">individuals and create the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:49.660" style="s2">does connect us to our neighbor I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.130" end="00:48:52.030" style="s2">that is what I am attempting to do a</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.660" end="00:48:55.270" style="s2">solution raising is showcase like look</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.030" end="00:48:58.390" style="s2">we can create a potential solution</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.270" end="00:49:00.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not divisive within an hour what</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.390" end="00:49:01.840" style="s2">if we actually made these right there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.100" end="00:49:03.880" style="s2">no left and right when it comes to are</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.840" end="00:49:05.860" style="s2">you hungry do you want to eat there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.880" end="00:49:07.870" style="s2">left and right when it&#39;s like you need</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.860" end="00:49:10.390" style="s2">to get from your point A to point B how</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.870" end="00:49:12.520" style="s2">do you transport yourself there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.390" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">know better and worse ways to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.520" end="00:49:18.010" style="s2">but those things are can be diverse</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:19.690" style="s2">that&#39;s right we can have their versus</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.010" end="00:49:22.780" style="s2">food system and transportation system</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.690" end="00:49:24.430" style="s2">and not need to have one or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.780" end="00:49:26.530" style="s2">like just one way everyone has to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.430" end="00:49:28.450" style="s2">this one way we can we can create the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.530" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">scaffold did you go down to sick dome I</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.450" end="00:49:35.710" style="s2">believe so so essentially I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.800" end="00:49:37.660" style="s2">people look to see I saw I was curious</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.710" end="00:49:39.400" style="s2">about towers and domes you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.660" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">construction of the dome and the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.400" end="00:49:43.360" style="s2">that they demonstrated doing it has just</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:46.330" style="s2">first build the first ring there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.360" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">giant tower that has cables that then</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.330" end="00:49:49.150" style="s2">you build the ring and you and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:50.260" style="s2">elevate it and then you build a next</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.150" end="00:49:51.910" style="s2">layer and you elevate it and you but</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.260" end="00:49:54.910" style="s2">then it&#39;s a time-lapse oh you watch this</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.910" end="00:49:56.770" style="s2">dome over time get tuned you know so</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.910" end="00:49:58.690" style="s2">it&#39;s building the eggshell from the top</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.770" end="00:50:01.540" style="s2">down but raising a little bit so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.690" end="00:50:04.210" style="s2">never any massive structure but after it</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.540" end="00:50:05.950" style="s2">becomes big enough the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.210" end="00:50:07.630" style="s2">interesting if you look at it the dome</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.950" end="00:50:09.340" style="s2">is actually strong enough at the point</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.630" end="00:50:13.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s complete that it can lift the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.340" end="00:50:16.210" style="s2">tower the tower becomes secondary</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.960" end="00:50:18.130" style="s2">it becomes irrelevant irrelevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.210" end="00:50:20.530" style="s2">overall structural strength but it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.130" end="00:50:22.690" style="s2">necessary in the transition so one of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.530" end="00:50:24.820" style="s2">the things that you mentioned Eric one</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.690" end="00:50:29.740" style="s2">of the questions that you asked is what</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.820" end="00:50:31.690" style="s2">is when we&#39;re cog that&#39;s one mode and</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.740" end="00:50:32.920" style="s2">it&#39;s very automatic right it has a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.690" end="00:50:34.570" style="s2">only running because the other ones are</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.920" end="00:50:37.240" style="s2">turning and it does it doesn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.570" end="00:50:39.099" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have its own sense but what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.240" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">asked is what&#39;s another mode</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.099" end="00:50:45.729" style="s2">and I think a transmission right does</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:50.259" style="s2">that right it is a it is a movement from</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.729" end="00:50:52.539" style="s2">one one power source to another power</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.259" end="00:50:56.229" style="s2">source in in a in a steady kind of a way</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.539" end="00:50:58.269" style="s2">rather than a rigid concerning</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.229" end="00:50:59.950" style="s2">transmission right it&#39;s not all somatic</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.269" end="00:51:01.569" style="s2">there&#39;s discernment involved it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.950" end="00:51:02.979" style="s2">neuron right it&#39;s only when a certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.569" end="00:51:05.380" style="s2">threshold is reached that the message</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.979" end="00:51:09.489" style="s2">actually goes any further kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.380" end="00:51:11.380" style="s2">and so each node is filtering out the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.489" end="00:51:13.569" style="s2">ship before passing anything on right</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.380" end="00:51:15.339" style="s2">whereas a cog has no choice but to pass</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.569" end="00:51:17.619" style="s2">on all the energy that came into it</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.339" end="00:51:20.049" style="s2">passes it on so yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.619" end="00:51:22.589" style="s2">there&#39;s agency and autonomy built in</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.049" end="00:51:24.910" style="s2">where the cog does not have that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.589" end="00:51:26.799" style="s2">which is which is the notion that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.910" end="00:51:30.339" style="s2">think I want to give gym rats we all</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.799" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">have to be on the same side or when Doug</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.339" end="00:51:34.749" style="s2">rushkoff talks about being on Team human</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">if team human means that we all have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.749" end="00:51:44.380" style="s2">agree to the same on the top side to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:46.809" style="s2">define our actions it&#39;s not nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.380" end="00:51:49.269" style="s2">enough it doesn&#39;t have enough of the of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.809" end="00:51:51.609" style="s2">that capacity for each of the nodes to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.269" end="00:51:58.329" style="s2">know okay what&#39;s my what&#39;s my action</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.609" end="00:52:03.430" style="s2">here and that this question is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.329" end="00:52:05.759" style="s2">beautiful question Who am I yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.430" end="00:52:08.619" style="s2">is it&#39;s about helping people find out</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.759" end="00:52:11.019" style="s2">which cog they are I think on some bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.619" end="00:52:12.039" style="s2">connotation I like to think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.019" end="00:52:14.229" style="s2">puzzle piece which is a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.039" end="00:52:17.319" style="s2">connotation for autistic people which I</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.229" end="00:52:20.529" style="s2">don&#39;t care about but uh I mean whatever</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.319" end="00:52:22.119" style="s2">that like we&#39;re all walking around with</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.529" end="00:52:23.710" style="s2">our own individual puzzle piece not even</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.119" end="00:52:25.719" style="s2">realizing it&#39;s like well we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.710" end="00:52:27.819" style="s2">be the whole picture but we can&#39;t be all</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.719" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">you can be is your puzzle piece and who</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.819" end="00:52:31.089" style="s2">do you fit with so you can make the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:34.299" style="s2">bigger picture and how do we coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.089" end="00:52:36.549" style="s2">with that because no one person can do</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.299" end="00:52:38.859" style="s2">it all no one person can hold all of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.549" end="00:52:40.599" style="s2">information which is where a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.859" end="00:52:43.029" style="s2">ideas have come from is like I want</p>

<p begin="00:52:43.029" end="00:52:47.950" style="s2">can never get in my brain because nobody</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.190" end="00:52:51.069" style="s2">can so how can we get it in an outside</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.950" end="00:52:52.539" style="s2">thing that I can have access to and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.069" end="00:52:53.859" style="s2">in order to put that out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.539" end="00:52:55.089" style="s2">access to it I have figured all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.859" end="00:52:56.739" style="s2">other pieces that we need that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.089" end="00:52:58.419" style="s2">nothing to do with necessarily knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.739" end="00:53:00.489" style="s2">that are had we feed ourselves how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.419" end="00:53:01.989" style="s2">clothe ourselves how do we and we govern</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.489" end="00:53:03.640" style="s2">how do we have that thing where this</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.989" end="00:53:07.959" style="s2">it&#39;s the cell next to you I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.640" end="00:53:09.099" style="s2">just gardening because I&#39;m trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.959" end="00:53:10.630" style="s2">in a garden even though I know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.099" end="00:53:11.919" style="s2">I&#39;m not great at it I never seem to</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.630" end="00:53:13.779" style="s2">manage to make things grow but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.919" end="00:53:15.069" style="s2">trying to dig up the roots of like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.779" end="00:53:16.329" style="s2">blackberry bushes that are really</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.069" end="00:53:18.069" style="s2">prickly because I know how blackberry</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.329" end="00:53:20.380" style="s2">bushes are not prickly and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.069" end="00:53:22.900" style="s2">get to grow there and the root structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.380" end="00:53:27.160" style="s2">of like you it&#39;s really such a like pull</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.900" end="00:53:29.169" style="s2">one root in is one Johnny but easier</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.160" end="00:53:30.369" style="s2">verses of course you can&#39;t pull the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.169" end="00:53:32.259" style="s2">whole thing up but you can pull each</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.369" end="00:53:35.559" style="s2">individual root and then and then pull</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.259" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">it up and no one told those roots to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.559" end="00:53:38.679" style="s2">grow the roots are all intermixed with</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:40.539" style="s2">the other ones they&#39;re all looking after</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.679" end="00:53:41.769" style="s2">their own self-interests really right</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.539" end="00:53:43.929" style="s2">there try to get their most nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.769" end="00:53:45.279" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to propagate but in so</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.929" end="00:53:47.319" style="s2">doing they&#39;ve made the the root</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.279" end="00:53:48.789" style="s2">structure more stable right not for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.319" end="00:53:50.199" style="s2">I want the roots not to be there but</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.789" end="00:53:52.239" style="s2">like for them there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.199" end="00:53:54.939" style="s2">stable about that if we follow what</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.239" end="00:53:56.769" style="s2">nature does we can get to a system that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.939" end="00:53:58.479" style="s2">isn&#39;t top-down it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.769" end="00:53:59.949" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how much I yell at that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.479" end="00:54:02.679" style="s2">root not to grow there it&#39;s gonna grow</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.949" end="00:54:04.809" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t care what I wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.679" end="00:54:06.699" style="s2">but it in so doing is looking at its own</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.809" end="00:54:10.019" style="s2">self-interest and it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.699" end="00:54:13.509" style="s2">ecosystem and making something better</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.019" end="00:54:15.999" style="s2">right it is stabilizing the soil so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.509" end="00:54:18.699" style="s2">other things can use that stable soil to</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.999" end="00:54:22.659" style="s2">grow as well it&#39;s not simply choking out</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.699" end="00:54:24.309" style="s2">but it&#39;s pretty much to be honest do</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.659" end="00:54:26.380" style="s2">pretty much choke out once they get</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.309" end="00:54:28.359" style="s2">established nothing else grows they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.380" end="00:54:30.309" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re little they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.359" end="00:54:31.539" style="s2">there are worthy adversary though I tell</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.309" end="00:54:32.949" style="s2">you you&#39;ve got to respect I mean much as</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.539" end="00:54:40.929" style="s2">I hate them you have to respect them</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.949" end="00:54:44.049" style="s2">they are well adapted south and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.929" end="00:54:45.849" style="s2">vicious yet strangely the blackberry</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.049" end="00:54:48.719" style="s2">bush isn&#39;t as hard to pull up the roots</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.849" end="00:54:51.279" style="s2">as the whatever other horrible flower</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.719" end="00:54:53.679" style="s2">thing that was out in my yard that was</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.279" end="00:54:55.779" style="s2">much harder to define those roots and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.679" end="00:54:57.909" style="s2">take them up the blackberry one actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.779" end="00:55:03.429" style="s2">isn&#39;t that held in there like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.909" end="00:55:05.559" style="s2">different gate everywhere yeah I had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.429" end="00:55:06.010" style="s2">whole field full of them I streamed them</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.559" end="00:55:08.440" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.010" end="00:55:09.970" style="s2">first of all and then as they started</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.440" end="00:55:10.810" style="s2">growing back again started digging them</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.970" end="00:55:14.890" style="s2">out one by one</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.810" end="00:55:16.900" style="s2">and I&#39;m convinced this one giant plant</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.890" end="00:55:19.780" style="s2">covering like a 500 square meter field</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.900" end="00:55:22.740" style="s2">it&#39;s one giant they are all connected to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.780" end="00:55:25.300" style="s2">each other in it and in it you&#39;ve met</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.740" end="00:55:28.320" style="s2">and I mean some of the roots Susie some</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.300" end="00:55:31.030" style="s2">of them are like this thick and they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.320" end="00:55:34.270" style="s2">meters and meters meters and meters long</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.030" end="00:55:36.700" style="s2">6 7 8 10 12 meters long and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.270" end="00:55:38.740" style="s2">Liana&#39;s they grow up and over the oak</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.700" end="00:55:41.050" style="s2">trees the oak trees are 12 15 meters</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.740" end="00:55:43.510" style="s2">high and they&#39;re brambles go up over and</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.050" end="00:55:44.830" style="s2">down again we can figure out how to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.510" end="00:55:46.540" style="s2">brambles we got it</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.830" end="00:55:49.420" style="s2">like if we can figure out how in any</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.540" end="00:55:52.630" style="s2">root is left behind we can regrow the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.420" end="00:55:54.520" style="s2">species right where it&#39;s like even if</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.630" end="00:55:57.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just one root it has the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.520" end="00:55:59.020" style="s2">information it needs to start regrowing</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.130" end="00:56:00.940" style="s2">to start where it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.020" end="00:56:02.680" style="s2">required to have this central body you</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.940" end="00:56:04.420" style="s2">know if we kill the central body oh</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.680" end="00:56:06.670" style="s2">these things are still coming back</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.420" end="00:56:10.300" style="s2">unless you get every last one of them</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.670" end="00:56:13.030" style="s2">and if we can create in that way that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.300" end="00:56:16.420" style="s2">hopefully isn&#39;t like a weed it&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.030" end="00:56:21.250" style="s2">everything over it&#39;s a welcome portion</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.420" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">but what&#39;s interesting isn&#39;t it when we</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.250" end="00:56:25.270" style="s2">get clever enough that we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.960" end="00:56:29.320" style="s2">essentially expand without limits right</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.270" end="00:56:31.540" style="s2">then we need to become our own limiting</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.320" end="00:56:33.310" style="s2">factor somehow or other you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.540" end="00:56:34.600" style="s2">otherwise the general may know somehow</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.310" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">or other we need to install our own</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.600" end="00:56:41.140" style="s2">limiting factors that&#39;s mm-hmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:44.110" style="s2">something that we have difficulty with</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.140" end="00:56:46.300" style="s2">right now right so it&#39;s actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.110" end="00:56:48.790" style="s2">the I&#39;m not gonna be able to remember</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.300" end="00:56:51.130" style="s2">his name right now Russell has mine his</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.790" end="00:56:53.140" style="s2">first or last name is Russell Brad do it</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.130" end="00:56:55.900" style="s2">Russell way now it&#39;s Stuart Russell I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.140" end="00:56:57.250" style="s2">believe is is his name or Russell Stuart</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.900" end="00:57:00.910" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the two</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.250" end="00:57:02.770" style="s2">he wrote a he wrote a book called human</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.910" end="00:57:05.830" style="s2">compatible which is about artificial</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.770" end="00:57:08.200" style="s2">intelligence he&#39;s the first the way that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.830" end="00:57:10.990" style="s2">it&#39;s build is that he&#39;s the first true a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.200" end="00:57:12.670" style="s2">I researcher deep a and deeply</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.990" end="00:57:14.530" style="s2">knowledgeable about AI is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.670" end="00:57:16.180" style="s2">the risk and potential of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.530" end="00:57:17.410" style="s2">intelligence and what do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.180" end="00:57:19.620" style="s2">need to be aware of what are the actual</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.410" end="00:57:20.760" style="s2">risks how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.620" end="00:57:23.640" style="s2">move forward with the center which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.760" end="00:57:25.380" style="s2">gonna make sense and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.640" end="00:57:26.970" style="s2">that he says what&#39;s human compatible is</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.380" end="00:57:30.330" style="s2">the notion that we have to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.970" end="00:57:33.090" style="s2">that it cares what we think about what</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.330" end="00:57:35.220" style="s2">it&#39;s doing you know which is a notion</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.090" end="00:57:36.810" style="s2">that&#39;s similar to what as a chasm offset</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.220" end="00:57:38.550" style="s2">in the three rules of robotics but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.810" end="00:57:40.800" style="s2">actually okay that&#39;s oversimplified how</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.550" end="00:57:44.370" style="s2">do you actually do that so that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.800" end="00:57:46.620" style="s2">don&#39;t say hey AI robot go and do this</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.370" end="00:57:50.850" style="s2">for me you say here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.620" end="00:57:52.170" style="s2">for what you know as I&#39;m going is there</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.850" end="00:57:54.300" style="s2">a feedback mechanism that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.170" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">continually check and say isn&#39;t moving</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.300" end="00:57:58.020" style="s2">in the direction that you expect or is</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:59.430" style="s2">it now wait a minute no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.020" end="00:58:01.350" style="s2">unintended I didn&#39;t expect that to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.430" end="00:58:04.380" style="s2">happen hold on pause let&#39;s wait a minute</p>
