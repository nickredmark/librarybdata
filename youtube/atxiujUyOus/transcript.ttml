<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:08.070" style="s2">he works language down to the bone he</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.070" end="00:05:13.180" style="s2">there&#39;s hardly a throwaway line in any</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:16.570" style="s2">of his songs and yet he sings them with</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.180" end="00:05:18.670" style="s2">such soulful ease that is because he</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.570" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">will not give up a song until it has a</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.660" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">deeper concerns of course he is a master</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.630" end="00:06:03.100" style="s2">wordsmith and an underrated novelist but</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">there are more accomplished poets out</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:09.970" style="s2">bad guitarist actually but Cohen&#39;s chord</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:12.550" style="s2">progressions are standard and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.970" end="00:06:14.980" style="s2">conservative even if he writes beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.550" end="00:06:17.140" style="s2">simple melodies although he has worked</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.980" end="00:06:19.720" style="s2">with great musicians and producers he</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.140" end="00:06:23.150" style="s2">didn&#39;t push the envelope musically like</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.720" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">for instance a prodigy like Frank Zappa</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.150" end="00:06:28.020" style="s2">still Cohen was an accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.800" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">minimalist and successfully worked with</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.240" end="00:06:58.740" style="s2">sang his songs Cohen gives us the word</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.839" end="00:11:39.130" style="s2">rather a deeper question which is where</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:19.610" style="s2">hospitalization eventually in such a</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.610" end="00:12:26.899" style="s2">ask for mercy from the higher powers and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.220" end="00:12:27.800" style="s2">muses to make a total confession Cohen</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:31.990" style="s2">more so than his contemporaries perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.019" end="00:12:34.430" style="s2">Nina Simone was similar in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:36.890" style="s2">but she never managed to surmount her</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.430" end="00:12:38.600" style="s2">depression she did however manage to do</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.180" end="00:12:48.279" style="s2">kind of talent than Simone but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.040" end="00:12:51.170" style="s2">sadness felt in the music is the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.279" end="00:12:52.200" style="s2">Cohen survived this Avalanche perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.170" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">because of his</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.200" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">tough Jewishness and sense of humor born</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:03.800" style="s2">winters what is the antidote for chronic</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.260" end="00:13:06.060" style="s2">sadness devotion may be the only way</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.800" end="00:13:09.089" style="s2">devotion is the great theme in Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.060" end="00:13:11.220" style="s2">devotion to teachers to lovers to his</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.089" end="00:13:12.029" style="s2">audience and that may have been what</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.220" end="00:13:14.130" style="s2">saved him</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.029" end="00:13:16.529" style="s2">his devotion to his audience is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.130" end="00:13:19.079" style="s2">supremely touching in those early years</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.529" end="00:13:21.750" style="s2">it pained him almost physically to give</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.690" end="00:13:53.459" style="s2">it turned into something in retrospect</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.149" end="00:13:56.910" style="s2">quite comic the entire audience turned</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.459" end="00:13:58.589" style="s2">into one Jew and this Jew is saying what</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:49.500" style="s2">Leonard Cohen songs express a radical</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.410" end="00:14:51.740" style="s2">kind of spirituality and eroticism but</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.500" end="00:14:54.329" style="s2">you cannot say that he is new-age</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.389" end="00:15:02.010" style="s2">songs are also fiery and subversive</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.470" end="00:15:04.710" style="s2">sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.010" end="00:15:07.590" style="s2">is a major theme in Cohen&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.710" end="00:15:10.020" style="s2">sacrifice is never separate from erotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.590" end="00:15:12.930" style="s2">love ecstatic vision and the lovers</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.820" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how Cohen&#39;s sings of</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:24.900" style="s2">love songs are about the desirable woman</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.800" end="00:15:39.900" style="s2">and is always creative and even</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.360" end="00:15:42.180" style="s2">subversive in the song Joan of Arc the</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.180" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">the war and wants a domestic rather than</p>
