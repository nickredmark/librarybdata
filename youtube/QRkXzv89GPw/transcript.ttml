<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:12.509" style="s2">conversation I had recently with Greg</p>

<p begin="00:00:12.509" end="00:00:17.310" style="s2">and the resulting protests in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.719" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">Greg has been on the channel before he</p>

<p begin="00:00:22.410" end="00:00:28.199" style="s2">theorist and when we originally met it</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">was to discuss Greg&#39;s work around using</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:32.340" style="s2">jazz as a technique to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">collective intelligence and we featured</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.340" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">that conversation in a film called lost</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.739" end="00:00:38.280" style="s2">ways of knowing I was really happy to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">catch up with him and I hope you enjoy</p>

<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">among other hats you wear you&#39;re also a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.140" end="00:01:00.780" style="s2">speaker at the rebel ISM festival last</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:02.899" style="s2">weekend and during the festival in in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.780" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">one of your sessions you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.899" end="00:01:07.170" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing in the u.s. right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">the horrific killing of George Floyd and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.170" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">the resulting protests that have sprung</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:15.030" style="s2">up so I just wanted to start there and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">just just check in and ask how you felt</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.030" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">when you first heard about what that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">murder the first thought was he would go</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:30.380" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:30.380" style="s2">and then not again</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.619" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">it would gets like a scab on a wound</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:44.070" style="s2">that heals and gets torn off time and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:47.700" style="s2">time again so and this is when I heard</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.070" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">about it this is before I even saw it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.700" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">it was it was infuriating it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:08.910" style="s2">something that it was such a graphic</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:11.330" style="s2">display of so many the dynamics not only</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.910" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.330" end="00:02:27.300" style="s2">bad policing and the black American</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:32.090" style="s2">community but power dynamics the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.300" end="00:02:36.330" style="s2">incredibly callous it wasn&#39;t the callous</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.090" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">casual approach that he took he had his</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.330" end="00:02:41.600" style="s2">hands in his pocket as he was choking</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.820" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">the life out of him with his knee and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.600" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">he&#39;s looking around seeing the people</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s saying to him look I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">says I can&#39;t breathe with you and he</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">keeps on going</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">so it&#39;s angering and saddening as I said</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:06.270" style="s2">in the piece that you referenced so</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:11.130" style="s2">right now how about how do I feel I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.270" end="00:03:16.650" style="s2">I feel kind of somber but I also feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.130" end="00:03:19.940" style="s2">hopeful and that&#39;s because I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.650" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">tell you a quick story this morning I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.940" end="00:03:27.650" style="s2">read what his six-year-old daughter</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:32.570" style="s2">Jorge floored six-year-old daughter said</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.650" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">she said my daddy has changed the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.570" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">and it brought me to tears man this</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:46.290" style="s2">little girl who&#39;s gonna grow up without</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.620" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">a father can see the uprising the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.290" end="00:03:57.079" style="s2">rebelling the protests that have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:04:01.400" style="s2">generated through his violent death</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.079" end="00:04:05.730" style="s2">coupled with armored augury</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.400" end="00:04:11.269" style="s2">Brianna Taylor and a great list of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.730" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">others that it&#39;s like enough is enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.269" end="00:04:16.820" style="s2">you know but one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:19.520" style="s2">makes me hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.820" end="00:04:22.490" style="s2">a couple of things one the young people</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.520" end="00:04:24.790" style="s2">who are with risen up as young people</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.490" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">tend to do generation after generation</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.790" end="00:04:34.190" style="s2">so that gives me hope I am really</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:39.410" style="s2">inspired by not only the working-class</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.190" end="00:04:41.270" style="s2">and intellectual is responding to what</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.410" end="00:04:45.050" style="s2">has been going on and raising their</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.270" end="00:04:50.750" style="s2">voices but leaders of other sectors of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.050" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">the society CEOs leaders in their fields</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.750" end="00:04:58.070" style="s2">and industries speaking out and speaking</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:05:00.440" style="s2">up that&#39;s that&#39;s something that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.070" end="00:05:02.270" style="s2">necessarily expect it I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.440" end="00:05:06.610" style="s2">really happened before like this and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.270" end="00:05:11.810" style="s2">also what gives me hope is knowing how</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.610" end="00:05:15.620" style="s2">how life and culture work that our</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.810" end="00:05:21.410" style="s2">reality as human beings isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.620" end="00:05:26.660" style="s2">physical it&#39;s also symbolic and Joey as</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.410" end="00:05:29.690" style="s2">a symbol is not only a victim his</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.660" end="00:05:33.860" style="s2">daughter was right he is going to help</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.690" end="00:05:37.400" style="s2">change the world because he&#39;s a tragic</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.860" end="00:05:40.700" style="s2">hero tragic heroes die but they still</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.400" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">are heroes and he&#39;s sacrificed his life</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.700" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">and he will be remembered and the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">can change if we keep working towards it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.770" end="00:05:54.230" style="s2">so so you&#39;re a you&#39;re a scholar black</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:57.220" style="s2">American issues in history in particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.230" end="00:06:00.140" style="s2">Albert Murray and Ralph Ellison now</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.220" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a it seems obviously I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.140" end="00:06:04.430" style="s2">there is a shared trajectory and story</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:06.020" style="s2">leading us right up until this point</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.430" end="00:06:08.570" style="s2">right now I&#39;m curious to get your</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.020" end="00:06:09.710" style="s2">thoughts on what&#39;s different or what do</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.570" end="00:06:12.590" style="s2">you what do you feel is different about</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.710" end="00:06:14.300" style="s2">the culture that injustice is like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.590" end="00:06:16.550" style="s2">are happening and now and the response</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.300" end="00:06:21.830" style="s2">to it compared to say in Ellis memories</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.550" end="00:06:23.900" style="s2">day yeah they came of age really in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.830" end="00:06:25.730" style="s2">midst of the late 50s and 60s where of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.900" end="00:06:27.910" style="s2">course you had the civil rights movement</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.910" end="00:06:34.899" style="s2">because of Technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.289" end="00:06:39.399" style="s2">you have new services actually covering</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.899" end="00:06:43.729" style="s2">protests and because of the brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.399" end="00:06:48.619" style="s2">genius strategy of non-violent protest</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.729" end="00:06:54.529" style="s2">by dr. Martin Luther King jr. and SCLC</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.619" end="00:07:01.869" style="s2">and other organizations you had a the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.529" end="00:07:06.129" style="s2">taping of just incredible racist</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.869" end="00:07:11.659" style="s2">responses to kids trying to go to school</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.129" end="00:07:13.909" style="s2">to people trying to vote you have four</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.659" end="00:07:17.240" style="s2">little girls being blown up in a church</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.240" end="00:07:25.999" style="s2">that going on but dr. King knew that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.509" end="00:07:28.219" style="s2">he was influenced by Gandhi he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.999" end="00:07:32.959" style="s2">influenced by Emerson and many others</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.219" end="00:07:37.309" style="s2">you know he&#39;s a very learned man he knew</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.959" end="00:07:41.629" style="s2">that if it were violent one black folks</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.309" end="00:07:47.269" style="s2">would be slaughtered okay you don&#39;t go</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.759" end="00:08:01.279" style="s2">don&#39;t do that so they took the moral</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.969" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">high ground and you saw black folks you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.279" end="00:08:09.860" style="s2">know being water hosed being in a trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:15.610" style="s2">to sit in a counter and being hit and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.860" end="00:08:18.439" style="s2">had milks poured over them and worse so</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.610" end="00:08:23.149" style="s2">that was the first instance where the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.439" end="00:08:25.490" style="s2">media raised the consciousness of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.149" end="00:08:28.430" style="s2">country and the world in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.490" end="00:08:32.449" style="s2">people are like whoa no no no no no no</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.430" end="00:08:34.810" style="s2">just saying right leading to in 1965 the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.449" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">passing of the Civil Rights Act and such</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.810" end="00:08:43.650" style="s2">you fast forward to today you start with</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">say Rodney King in 1990 California</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.650" end="00:08:53.070" style="s2">with his brutal beating by officers and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:55.650" style="s2">then them getting off you know on up to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.070" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">today where we all it ain&#39;t just the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.650" end="00:09:04.980" style="s2">news media we know we are not one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:07.470" style="s2">these and folks are taping stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.980" end="00:09:10.860" style="s2">it&#39;s being put up on social media and</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.860" end="00:09:17.430" style="s2">time so that&#39;s the similarity well some</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.230" end="00:09:21.870" style="s2">of the differences of what I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.430" end="00:09:24.600" style="s2">earlier I have never seen in so many</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.870" end="00:09:28.110" style="s2">sectors of the society in so many levels</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.640" end="00:09:38.760" style="s2">more on the looting and rioting which I</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.400" end="00:10:12.900" style="s2">ends okay but you got folks who focused</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:16.709" style="s2">on that and also then the violent tragic</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.900" end="00:10:18.930" style="s2">deaths that precipitated the protests</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.709" end="00:10:22.070" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about the two figures you</p>

<p begin="00:10:22.070" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">Albert Murray and not Ellison as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:30.600" style="s2">proto integral thinkers and if we get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:32.550" style="s2">explore that a bit but just just first</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.600" end="00:10:35.100" style="s2">off for anyone kind of not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.550" end="00:10:38.070" style="s2">integral theory why why do you feel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.100" end="00:10:41.490" style="s2">a useful frame for looking at you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.070" end="00:10:44.520" style="s2">race identity culture as a whole and why</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.490" end="00:10:47.630" style="s2">is it useful now in particular yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.520" end="00:10:52.910" style="s2">me into the theory is like a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.630" end="00:10:56.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a way to frame map and model</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.910" end="00:10:57.560" style="s2">reality on different levels so you take</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.790" end="00:11:01.010" style="s2">the fall</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.560" end="00:11:04.910" style="s2">audience of aqua all quadrants all</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.010" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">levels that King Wilbur talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.910" end="00:11:11.630" style="s2">the four quadrants are the inner and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:15.650" style="s2">outer dimensions of individual and</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.650" end="00:11:25.190" style="s2">as persons so if you have on the top two</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.529" end="00:11:28.670" style="s2">you have on the left side the upper left</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.190" end="00:11:31.070" style="s2">the subjective realm the realm of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.670" end="00:11:33.260" style="s2">thoughts you know the inner part of us</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.070" end="00:11:35.660" style="s2">as individuals then on the right the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.260" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">upper right you&#39;ve got our bodies our</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.660" end="00:11:41.720" style="s2">brains and such right and on the lower</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:44.570" style="s2">left you&#39;ve got the inner dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.720" end="00:11:46.370" style="s2">groups and then on the lower right</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.570" end="00:11:51.380" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the inner dimensions of</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.380" end="00:11:55.970" style="s2">could look at race through those</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.850" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">quadrants so one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.970" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">have started to say is that to be an</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:02.810" style="s2">anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">you have to I think interrogate and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.810" end="00:12:08.120" style="s2">critique the very concept of race</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.560" end="00:12:11.089" style="s2">integral theory is powerful because it</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.120" end="00:12:14.660" style="s2">gives you a way to critique race as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.089" end="00:12:17.660" style="s2">theory and as a biological reality while</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.660" end="00:12:19.940" style="s2">acknowledging that it does find its</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.660" end="00:12:22.220" style="s2">place and land in other dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.940" end="00:12:24.830" style="s2">life so that&#39;s one perspective and one</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.220" end="00:12:28.310" style="s2">important way of looking at race through</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.830" end="00:12:32.540" style="s2">integral Theory another is developmental</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.310" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">theory which in the last I guess 30</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.540" end="00:12:37.810" style="s2">years I&#39;m really - my adult</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:39.430" style="s2">developmental theory for the most part</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.430" end="00:12:47.450" style="s2">Robert Keegan Suzanne Cooke Gruyter and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.690" end="00:12:49.580" style="s2">others who have developed different</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.580" end="00:12:53.510" style="s2">even without those there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:57.140" style="s2">developmental theories that we can take</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.510" end="00:13:01.220" style="s2">a look at that are very helpful in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.140" end="00:13:05.000" style="s2">understanding race okay so if you take</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.220" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">one particular trajectory traditional</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.000" end="00:13:10.990" style="s2">modern postmodern integral or same</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.990" end="00:13:18.070" style="s2">race which has to do with outer</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.070" end="00:13:24.680" style="s2">at the ethnocentric stage if someone</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.320" end="00:13:30.020" style="s2">looks differently whoa that&#39;s like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.680" end="00:13:33.650" style="s2">you know that&#39;s another then we get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.020" end="00:13:35.630" style="s2">the modern stage hey let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.650" end="00:13:38.140" style="s2">scientific let&#39;s look at race as as</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.630" end="00:13:40.850" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s actually a reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.140" end="00:13:43.820" style="s2">biologically no then you get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.850" end="00:13:48.860" style="s2">post-modernism and it says but racism is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.820" end="00:13:51.740" style="s2">a social construction yes and you get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.860" end="00:13:55.610" style="s2">integral and you say you know something</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.740" end="00:13:56.780" style="s2">as an index to human reality in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.610" end="00:13:59.690" style="s2">someone&#39;s intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.780" end="00:14:00.590" style="s2">it&#39;s almost potential so it don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.690" end="00:14:03.650" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.590" end="00:14:05.840" style="s2">how you gonna judge somebody based on</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.650" end="00:14:11.320" style="s2">their outer appearance the way they look</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.840" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">it is ludicrous but it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.320" end="00:14:22.600" style="s2">particularly snow with the advent of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:26.600" style="s2">slave trade in Europe as it came from</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.600" end="00:14:32.840" style="s2">it ended up becoming when you added it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.970" end="00:14:36.860" style="s2">to the you know theory of evolution not</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.840" end="00:14:39.770" style="s2">as Darwin proposed it but as some people</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.860" end="00:14:42.140" style="s2">took his theory and used it to their own</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.770" end="00:14:44.900" style="s2">ends you have what they call scientific</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.140" end="00:14:48.110" style="s2">racism scientific justification for it</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.900" end="00:14:52.790" style="s2">in the mythological sphere you have you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.110" end="00:14:56.360" style="s2">know darkness being viewed as akin to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.790" end="00:15:00.430" style="s2">the devil and likeness being akin to all</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.360" end="00:15:03.880" style="s2">this good that that&#39;s overlaid right</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.430" end="00:15:07.190" style="s2">another way integral looks at it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.880" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">through the lens of like ethnocentric</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.190" end="00:15:16.490" style="s2">identity to more of a regional or</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:20.030" style="s2">national identity to a world sent to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.490" end="00:15:24.170" style="s2">cosmos century identity and as you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.030" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">these wider circles of care concern</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.170" end="00:15:31.250" style="s2">identification the less and less you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:33.740" style="s2">likely to be behold into a theory such</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.250" end="00:15:35.500" style="s2">as race which is something Ralph Ellison</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.740" end="00:15:37.459" style="s2">called blood thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.500" end="00:15:40.450" style="s2">ethnocentric thinking that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.459" end="00:15:42.649" style="s2">have certain qualities of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.450" end="00:15:46.010" style="s2">because you&#39;re a member of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.649" end="00:15:47.720" style="s2">group and you have a certain blood and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.010" end="00:15:51.110" style="s2">those qualities in the blood you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.720" end="00:15:53.750" style="s2">the the hot you know Italia is now the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.110" end="00:15:55.550" style="s2">thing is these are stereotypes which and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.750" end="00:15:58.940" style="s2">the thing about stereotypes as they say</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.550" end="00:16:01.010" style="s2">it has some similar sub truths but you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.940" end="00:16:03.470" style="s2">don&#39;t have to use it in an invidious way</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.010" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">you can use it as a way of appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.470" end="00:16:09.950" style="s2">appreciating excuse me the ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:13.670" style="s2">diversity and various styles and ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.950" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">people move and live and talk and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.670" end="00:16:19.490" style="s2">and dance and eat in the world you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:22.790" style="s2">an appreciation for difference in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.490" end="00:16:26.750" style="s2">way you know so I used integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.790" end="00:16:29.540" style="s2">to critique race in those ways and my</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.750" end="00:16:32.209" style="s2">particular focus really is centered in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.540" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">the lower-left a cultural dimension in</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.209" end="00:16:41.810" style="s2">particular as that&#39;s the place I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:46.699" style="s2">of meaning and tools of values and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.810" end="00:16:51.380" style="s2">principles of lifestyles based on those</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.699" end="00:16:54.589" style="s2">values that manifest as ways of being in</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.970" end="00:17:04.819" style="s2">technologies that Alba Mary said are</p>

<p begin="00:17:07.040" end="00:17:14.270" style="s2">through play into art hmm that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:15.589" style="s2">just to dive into something a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.270" end="00:17:18.280" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s worth I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.589" end="00:17:20.120" style="s2">and this is a really good point about</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.280" end="00:17:23.150" style="s2">integral giving us a kind of heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.120" end="00:17:26.929" style="s2">and a way to see things in different</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.150" end="00:17:29.330" style="s2">quadrants because a big part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.929" end="00:17:31.730" style="s2">anger right now and traditionally in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.330" end="00:17:34.040" style="s2">culture when when one group is treated</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.730" end="00:17:36.020" style="s2">unfairly is that it is both a social</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">so how does integral help us explain</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.460" end="00:17:44.630" style="s2">maps it always I think it&#39;s been I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.830" end="00:17:46.670" style="s2">for many people there&#39;s a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.429" end="00:21:01.480" style="s2">is in the I we face then that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.340" end="00:21:04.149" style="s2">need to focus primarily yes acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.480" end="00:21:07.450" style="s2">and fight those battles in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.149" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">systems and structures but each of us as</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:15.730" style="s2">people need to look at how can we make</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.240" end="00:21:19.269" style="s2">things better what what are the barriers</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.730" end="00:21:22.419" style="s2">that get in the way of us making things</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.269" end="00:21:26.139" style="s2">better what are the good things from the</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.090" end="00:21:41.740" style="s2">human beings need that you are not going</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.989" end="00:23:44.629" style="s2">important for us to know that we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.159" end="00:23:47.809" style="s2">agency and responsibility also and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.100" end="00:26:28.770" style="s2">so we can then create through empathetic</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.470" end="00:26:42.120" style="s2">people don&#39;t like to to do that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.050" end="00:26:45.470" style="s2">self-reflection because it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.120" end="00:26:48.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not is it&#39;s painful you know but</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.470" end="00:26:51.690" style="s2">not only without struggles then no</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.510" end="00:26:54.420" style="s2">progress without some pain and learning</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.690" end="00:26:56.940" style="s2">there is no growth I was also really</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.420" end="00:27:00.090" style="s2">struck by you know when we spoken before</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.940" end="00:27:02.010" style="s2">is is that that combination of utter</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.090" end="00:27:05.190" style="s2">injustice and hopelessness and despair</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.010" end="00:27:07.770" style="s2">and hope and you&#39;ve talked about that in</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.190" end="00:27:09.570" style="s2">relation to the Blues and I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.770" end="00:27:11.040" style="s2">so fundamental to the black American</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.570" end="00:27:12.330" style="s2">experience love to just hear hear what</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.040" end="00:27:18.890" style="s2">it is about the blues then what was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.330" end="00:27:23.330" style="s2">blues attitude to that well the Blues is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.890" end="00:27:26.550" style="s2">as Ralph Ellison once said in order by</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.330" end="00:27:30.540" style="s2">autobiographical chronicle of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.550" end="00:27:35.010" style="s2">catastrophe expressed lyrically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.540" end="00:27:38.040" style="s2">one as a poetic kind of description his</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.780" end="00:27:49.140" style="s2">as I said in the rebel ISM festival he</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.860" end="00:27:57.270" style="s2">coined a phrase called the Blues idiom</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.140" end="00:28:01.580" style="s2">and the Blues idiom to Murray was a way</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.270" end="00:28:08.250" style="s2">a that black Americans confronted</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.580" end="00:28:11.580" style="s2">absurdity oppression existence itself so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.250" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s an existential perspective on life</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.580" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">that says life is a low-down dirty shame</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.970" end="00:28:29.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a fact but you know something</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.370" end="00:28:33.900" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be as intentional and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.130" end="00:28:36.510" style="s2">purposeful as we can we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.900" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">clear on our goals and objectives and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.510" end="00:28:42.450" style="s2">our visions and we&#39;re going to work</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:44.670" style="s2">towards it it says that we are going</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.450" end="00:28:47.640" style="s2">to develop the kind of skill sets and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.670" end="00:28:51.210" style="s2">heart sets and soul sets that will give</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.640" end="00:28:53.480" style="s2">us the wherewithal to withstand the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.210" end="00:28:59.820" style="s2">slings and arrows of outrageous fortune</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.480" end="00:29:02.370" style="s2">and with those skills and the individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.820" end="00:29:05.640" style="s2">excellence that in the model that my</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.370" end="00:29:09.530" style="s2">apartment of wife Jill and I have you</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.640" end="00:29:13.890" style="s2">don&#39;t do it just as a heroic individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.530" end="00:29:16.560" style="s2">you do it as a heroic collective you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.890" end="00:29:19.220" style="s2">it with other people in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.560" end="00:29:23.460" style="s2">you can make things better so the Blues</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.220" end="00:29:26.250" style="s2">acknowledges the lowdown dirty shameless</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.460" end="00:29:30.330" style="s2">of life it doesn&#39;t ignite the diamond</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.250" end="00:29:33.510" style="s2">ayat repress it it says it as the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.330" end="00:29:38.010" style="s2">Thelonious Monk song says straight no</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.510" end="00:29:42.870" style="s2">chaser but at the same time we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.010" end="00:29:46.350" style="s2">to acknowledge recognize and embrace joy</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.870" end="00:29:49.080" style="s2">even if it&#39;s momentary we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.350" end="00:29:51.060" style="s2">kind of dance we&#39;re gonna have we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.080" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">gonna express ourselves with our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.060" end="00:30:01.250" style="s2">with that embodied cognition and we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:30:05.630" style="s2">going to celebrate and affirm the very</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.250" end="00:30:09.690" style="s2">reality and existence of life itself and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.630" end="00:30:12.780" style="s2">my kinfoke black folks do that very well</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.690" end="00:30:16.980" style="s2">which is why to Ralph Ellison monstro he</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.780" end="00:30:21.630" style="s2">says you know for the blues the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.980" end="00:30:24.660" style="s2">spirituals the jazz the dance is what we</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.630" end="00:30:28.610" style="s2">had in place of freedom in place of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.660" end="00:30:32.340" style="s2">social political and economic freedom</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.610" end="00:30:34.470" style="s2">but we expressed our as culturally</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.340" end="00:30:40.680" style="s2">that&#39;s why I look to culture is such a</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.470" end="00:30:45.390" style="s2">powerful place for the responses to life</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.680" end="00:30:48.030" style="s2">and to injustice that that not only we</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.390" end="00:30:49.740" style="s2">as a people but that I mean the Blues is</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.030" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">something that may have originated and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.740" end="00:30:55.530" style="s2">did originate with black Americans but</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:56.340" style="s2">the Blues is universal you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.530" end="00:30:58.020" style="s2">in Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.340" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">talk about you know life is suffering</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.020" end="00:31:03.779" style="s2">that&#39;s the bluesman you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:05.730" style="s2">something that you know is rooted yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.779" end="00:31:07.590" style="s2">can be embraced and should be embracing</p>
