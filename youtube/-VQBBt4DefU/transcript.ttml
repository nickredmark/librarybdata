<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:10.400" style="s2">does one of the reasons why we have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.400" style="s2">it resonates off of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.720" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">you&#39;re going to meet us all in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.360" end="00:01:18.400" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">um myself bonnie and ria and nora</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.400" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">and skye and miriam and eche</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">very brief history this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">emerged from um conversations i had</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">starting a couple of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">where people after doing a podcast would</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">why aren&#39;t there not more women in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">space who do you recommend</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">and what would happen at that time is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">i would immediately many women&#39;s names</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">would come to my</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">uh in my imagination but i&#39;m like really</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna do a rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">podcast there was like a disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:00.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">the framing that the podcast offers in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.880" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">what these women could offer</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.040" end="00:02:08.080" style="s2">so is there a disconnect between the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">constraints of the medium</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.080" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">and the real juice and gem</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">of the way i was talking to some</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">to some of these women so we started</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">consciously starting with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">and and skye and i and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">yeah and it took a while for us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">allow more</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">information to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">show us what this might be and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">had a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">email conversation amongst all of us</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">and what we decided together</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">to seed this first conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">is a little bit of a dialogue around</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">uh conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">what for us personally do we find</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">missing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">from this ecology of podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">that um that connect us</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">what kind of conversation are we</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">starving to see reflected back to us</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">right this is a very powerful you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">when you grew up in the 60s and you saw</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">tv and you saw like families acting a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">certain way</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">you were ashamed because your family</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t act like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t give you permission to be who you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">were and something like that happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">sometimes in the podcast space you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:38.799" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t reason like that i don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.799" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">that is like a is like shame like and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">uh part of what we&#39;re hoping to do is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">into the light this whole other vast</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">resource of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">and knowledge um</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">that we think people are starving for uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">in the public realm</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">and that we can build capacity through</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">that feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">so um yeah what how would you how would</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">you describe</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">what&#39;s missing in the space what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">what would</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">you love to see tune in and see</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">um conversation um</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">yeah and then we can just talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">some of the ways we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">name this later if we want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">um yeah what do you see is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">the conversation that has most air time</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">uh what kind of conversations would do</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">would be valuable to see reflected in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">the public space</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">are you opening it up oh no this first</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">is for our panel discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">thanks for asking um</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">i can jump in hi bonnie hi everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">so uh as you asked that question the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">first thing that comes to my</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">mind and my heart is what i would love</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">to see more of and hope maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">bring is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">a movement from the theoretical to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">embodied to the practical to the daily</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">so while i love the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">explorations</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">and sort of the intellectual gymnastics</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">and the deeper depths and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">widths and the breadths of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">that can happen in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">theoretical space i think um</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">what feels very pressing to me both</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">individually and as i look out and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:06:01.199" style="s2">feel the world is how can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">bring these insights that we have right</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">into cut really into our daily bread</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">like how we show up with our kids how we</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">show up with our partners</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">um how we spend our days uh so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of one</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">little beginning impulse that is present</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">i i just really want to second that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">miriam and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">say that i i</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">i find so often that um</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">you know benito was talking about shame</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">and that there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">a very real experience of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">of having this toggle of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">if either you&#39;re speaking in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.919" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">theoretical space and so you&#39;re showing</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">that you know your theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">okay and that gives you some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">expertise or credibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">for being in the complexity realm</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">but um the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">is to be talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">that embodied understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">is played out in daily life</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">and very often people don&#39;t recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">when it&#39;s in daily life because it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">can produce a lot of writing how is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">at what time and you know for how long</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">like everyone obviously to speak um</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">but i just thought it was interesting um</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">how you said how you look up to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">and then i was thinking what is the lens</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">that i hold as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">regarding these people on podcasts and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">realize the lens i hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">is actually how well do they embody this</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">like i will take someone way more</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">if they are living and breathing what</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about so i just thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">i&#39;d add that little note</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">and to pick up from there um</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">in our email exchange we had</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">over the last weeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">i also put up the ques the question like</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">can we actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">be it right here right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">together can we embody</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">can we actually show</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">how complexity sits in a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">conversation and in a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve been searching the web</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">to actually find it but</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">it hardly was it hardly is there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">i go with your lens miriam like</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">are they embodying it or is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">theory or</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">and it made me aware of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">that the mental</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">few on things or the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">is still</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">at least in in this kind of medium is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">um more valued or higher valued or</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">as much as as</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">we think that things are more balanced</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">around knowing or</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how else to call it</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that we could and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">should and need to explore i think</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">i feel when you speak</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">um which is nice because what i was</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">gonna add is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">um i often feel like i have like a wild</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">animal</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">inside of me when i&#39;m in these spit when</p>

<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you know we&#39;ve tamed</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">conversations so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s some deeper</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">um experience that i&#39;m yearning</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">for like when you said what are you</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">hungry for what are you starving for</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">i&#39;m really hungry for experiences where</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">i can um</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">be a little bit wilder</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">like a little more unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">and and that maybe others would feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">comfortable to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">a little more unpredictable like bonnie</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">you always talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">your job being to insert novelty into</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:46.639" style="s2">i love that because it just brings for</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">me it brings things</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.639" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">to life and um</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s some aspect for me too</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if this is personal but</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">i&#39;m sure others there are others for</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">whom this will resonate</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">the emotional experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">like my my tuning fork like the way i</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">move through the world is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">very for better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">emotionally tuned and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">um yeah sometimes i find that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">not really</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">and it could be me projecting this but i</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">i do find that there&#39;s maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">as much space for me to express emotions</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">um and part of that is that i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">that if i express</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">them they will be misunderstood or you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">know they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">there won&#39;t be space for them somehow so</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">it&#39;s me with my you know it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">like me</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">fighting my own taming the wild animal</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">and the tame part</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">yeah so this is interesting already</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.839" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">you know in these there part of this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">forwarding this into the public realm</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.519" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">and there&#39;s only so many</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">models and of course uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a strange attractor how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">perform what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">what is the implicit rules and the</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:24.800" style="s2">like this is stereotypical and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">to frame the conversation but in general</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">the models are like</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">women show up as uh like</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">performance like the view like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">lot of performance happening and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">a lot of emotional</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.639" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">but then in these spaces these new kind</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">series and podcasts and this in this</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">and ignoring this is you&#39;ll know this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">it&#39;s like the price of admission to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">express an emotion</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">is to show you&#39;re very very cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s what doesn&#39;t bring people</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">like skyler and echa in</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the price of admission if you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">prove yeah i understand yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">understand yeah i understand yeah i</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">that but then i&#39;m saying this is very</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">then you&#39;re trustworthy and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">price of admission</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">to express an emotion in these spaces</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">and it&#39;s not about only emotions</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s also what i call that inner</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">that intuition the uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">the sense you have of something it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">real emotion like sadness or happy or</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">anger or frustration but there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">formats or i don&#39;t find the right word</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">of knowing that they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">important and that we need to balance</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">and that will actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">actually we need that wholeness i call</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">it the wholeness of knowing for actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">sensing and knowing what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">the next step we can take um</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s like there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">scripts</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">and um there are different scripts for</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">sorts of zones um you know there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">this sort of script and that sort of</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">then there&#39;s how you&#39;re living your life</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">and the way that you approach</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">breakfast the way that you are</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">your own transformations in this time</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">that is what&#39;s happening um is</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">is requiring</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">a completely different tonality and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">texture</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">of of exploration okay and so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">exploration is going to have a different</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">kind of expression</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">and and so we don&#39;t there&#39;s just not a</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">to have that kind of expression of</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.880" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">in a lot of transformations right now uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">what what is it what does it feel like</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">start talking about second and third</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">different pace that we&#39;re having which</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">i&#39;m really enjoying um</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple things that feel alive</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">one is that this conversation feels like</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">it has spaciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m not feeling sometimes i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">these kind of conversations and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">there&#39;s actually something that would</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">like to be spoken through me or someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">else and you can hardly get a word in</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">so even the fact that when one of us has</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">spoken there&#39;s a little space</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">feels like already part of that movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">of embodying um and the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">thing i wanted to share was as you were</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">speaking nora</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">i could feel i&#39;m curious how this lands</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">for you but i could feel how</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">when we are bringing the the muchness</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">the complexity into daily life in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">experience there&#39;s actually a</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">actually very simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:18.799" style="s2">because it it would be quite impossible</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">to bring all the different angles and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.799" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">perspectives and systems upon systems</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">the whole thing can feel like a big</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:25.840" style="s2">carriage how are you ever going to fit</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.840" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">into how are you going to chat with your</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">in your actual being then in in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">there is a simplicity i&#39;m not bringing</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">it all i&#39;m actually just showing up with</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">a trust that it is there and uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">and in a way a stepping into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">and not having to show up as the one who</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">knows</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">but i think that maybe is also something</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">would yearn for in these podcast spaces</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t all have to show up as experts</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">know what we know and share it which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">awesome but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">really be there present with the edges</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have a clue about</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">or that we&#39;re just very curious about</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">and inquisitive and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">looking to find out together</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">i would like to highlight what i just</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">heard that&#39;s most important</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">for me um</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">you know i have a five-year-old child</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">most of my time is still very much being</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">a mother</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">like 90 95 of my time it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">and um um</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">miriam is you said something about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:28.799" style="s2">being of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">uh the moment of uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">of that practice when as mothers were</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">trying to embody um certain ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">is actually simple uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">it is that simplicity that i would love</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">to hear us and other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">to to start trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">and i know bonnie hates it hates it when</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">i say principles and guiding principles</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">but i have that kind of tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">look for um north</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">stars at least if not</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">mean i do not believe in set in</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.880" end="00:25:21.039" style="s2">principle set in stone principles but</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">um i feel like there are certain north</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.039" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">stars that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">could guide us in settling into that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">of just being with the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">that it is our</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">being that is wiring</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">the child in front of us</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">um and that wiring is what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">carry that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">this new newly forming human</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">uh for the rest of his life so</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">it it matters greatly</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">how he gets wired in the early years of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">his life</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just so interesting because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.679" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">so much of the communication that just</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">has to do with not</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">diving into the cultural script that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">been written for us and uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">that is sometimes the hardest thing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">the world to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">whether it&#39;s to not say the thing or to</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">respond in a way that&#39;s off off off</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:31.039" style="s2">off the teleprompter and it&#39;s i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.039" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">the compelling urge to say the thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">um i remember this one time when my</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.840" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">daughter</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">was i don&#39;t know she was like 14 15. i</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">walked into her room and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">complete mess</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">right clothes all over the floor my</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">clothes</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">and um and that she had borrowed i</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">walked in and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it happened here it comes my god</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">how do you even think in here this place</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">is a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">i spend all this money on things for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">and this is how you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">you know can you hear the script do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">know the script we know the script</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">and she looked at me and she was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">she looks a lot like me and she had this</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">like red hair and she was fire</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">and she said you can&#39;t tell me how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">live my life</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">okay and in that moment on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">teleprompter there&#39;s a few options</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">right and one of them is young lady</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">don&#39;t talk to me like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">another one sounds like well as long as</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">you live under my roof i sure do have</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">the right to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">right okay we know these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">and somehow like you were saying miriam</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">in that moment i</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">what i saw was this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">fire and i thought my god this is so</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">beautiful this fire what</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">damage it would be to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">break this fire i don&#39;t even want to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">dampen it but to break the fire</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">and i just looked at her and i was like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;re right i don&#39;t have the right to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">tell you what to do and she just knew i</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">was going to come back with one of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:18.799" style="s2">script lines she was ready she was</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">and then it wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">and what happened in that moment was</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">not only did we have a shifting of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">arrangement about what was important in</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">life which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">fairly significant but we also had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">around what it feels like to get off the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">cultural scripts</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:44.559" style="s2">together and and she got to see me</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">learning something and changing my path</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.559" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">sensing something i didn&#39;t know i was</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">sense responding differently and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">actually altering the course of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">relational process</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s i think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">is it&#39;s in those moments and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">your those moments with your partners</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">like that that thing of just you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">when you&#39;re really looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">incredible complexity of life like</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">what do you want someone to promise you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.120" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">how do you want to be how do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">with someone given the complexity of at</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">what is that and that&#39;s a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">of question so</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">i think this is an important shift</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">that&#39;s the disservice that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">these complexity i mean there&#39;s a time</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">for the theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s a time to look at complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">systems from a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:29:57.120" style="s2">point of view</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:02.240" style="s2">like hydrology and plasma movements and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">stuff like that but there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.240" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">question whether</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.799" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">on my dining room table</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">and i watched that work on me right that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">it was there for like</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">five months now the thing is it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t see it it&#39;s just a chainsaw</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">on a dining room table</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">right and the truth is all of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">things that drive us crazy</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">are just like that they&#39;re just silly</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">concrete things</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">that are scripted in us in these</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">pathological ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">so i watched that i was teaching my</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">course and i go in and tell the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">students every month you know i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">watching that thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">and it resolved itself by itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">but it never fully resolved in me right</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">quiet now that sounds silly</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">it&#39;s nice sorry about the dog but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">just leave it at that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">like these opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">yeah this is where the opportunities are</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just noticing in both your</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">stories the inner</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">competence you know the the inner</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">that nora you had in that moment that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">you were able to see what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">in you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">and see your daughter</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">for me of this kind of process of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">really i watched</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">how it was working on me you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">um yeah and i still</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">i i would spend a lot of time working on</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">my inner</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">competence as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">mystic and tantric practitioner like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">lot of my practice</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">is is the inner awareness</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">and still when the rubber hits the road</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">parenting i mean this could this could</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">potentially just be a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">parenting um or relationships or</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s all right there right but it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">for me the parenting that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">really is the big uh test</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">of all my so-called</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">spirituality um and it&#39;s such a gift</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s such a gift i have fortunately a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:26.919" style="s2">no-nonsense nine-year-old girl</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">and she won&#39;t take it she points out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.919" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">inconsistencies</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">all the time and she because of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">pandemic i&#39;m doing a lot of my work in</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">front of her</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">which is kind of amazing because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">doing a lot of coaching</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">and very deep one-on-one work with</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">people and you know i&#39;m mostly wearing</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">and and she&#39;s not always around but um</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">but sometimes she&#39;s hearing me you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">in a conversation like this or</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">coaching someone or talking someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">through something and then i turn around</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">and yell at her for whatever it is and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">she&#39;s just like</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">but i kind of hit him i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">not very hard but that was the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">nora was dying and then</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">so he immediately he kicked me back yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">a normal healthy response so and i</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">i stopped and i didn&#39;t say anything and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:18.800" style="s2">i remember my mother-in-law kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:21.040" style="s2">trying to force me to to say something</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.800" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">to him because that was not appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.040" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">but i was like</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:25.359" style="s2">this is healthy if you get kicked you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">kick</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">back kind of and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">the the point was more to stand up</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">her view of me being the mother</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">with my then alice so</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">that and yeah there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">examples of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">yeah can we</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:38:03.680" style="s2">yet to to actually choose</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">to step out of that mold and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.680" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">again and again and again um</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">and probably help each other to step out</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">of the mold</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">and not give up i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">the conditioning is so deep and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">old and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">yeah that was my contribution for now</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">um i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">bring in the future here as i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">listening i&#39;m hearing how we are all</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">working with patterning that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">our past</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">and um there was something you said</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">nora about it we were talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.400" style="s2">can you bring that complexity into life</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.400" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">and it can be hard right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">sort of going right on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">and you don&#39;t really have scripts that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">you can follow</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">so that that was sort of the the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">there a future um</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">how can we you know one one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">questions i hold a lot in my work with</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">parents is how can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">recreate culture in our families how can</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">we do it in our partnerships</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">and and how do we do it partly for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">yes becoming very aware of the scripts</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">that come from the past and know how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">navigate them and become much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">competent with that navigation</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">the other piece is to to use the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">yearning we have towards the future to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">use our imagination that we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">of a possible future and even to use</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">literally any any way we can inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">a possible future that feels more sane</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">that feels more whole like can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">actually inhabit that even if just for</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">momentary states</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">to then inform us back to the present</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">um and i was chuckling as sky you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">talking about your daughter</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">listening to you coaching in a way i</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">hear the dynamic right there i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">i teach a course for years now called</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">parenting as a spiritual practice so i</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.599" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">had a five-year-old who would look at me</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">once in a while put her</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">put her hands on her hips and say mama</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">that&#39;s not parenting it&#39;s a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:30.079" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">and literally the only thing i could do</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">in that moment was like yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">you know and part of the context</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">within which i was teaching and which</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve been parenting her</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">is it&#39;s a journey we just doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">we have to be there to be able to embody</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">the culture</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">we are talking about so we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">be very inspired we can speak about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">we can coach others in it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">we&#39;re making our way there we&#39;ll fall</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">flat on our faces at times</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:40:59.680" style="s2">and so then we can actually model i</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">think for our kids also</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">saying sorry or i really didn&#39;t get that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">one right</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">um which i also heard in in the weave of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">your sharings</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because it seems like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.839" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">um first of all i i just have to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">that i completely agree with you and in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">in the discussion of you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">what what is the future all of this for</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">me that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">lies absolutely in the intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">um and and what is so tricky is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">in some frameworks of the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">we are often in pods talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">theoretical and cognitive aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:57.250" style="s2">this piece um defies</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">any kind of logic that could be</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.250" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">theorized upon that you could that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">could map</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">there is the deep experience of identity</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">and and how that is i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">why do we do the things we do we you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">know there&#39;s so many things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">that don&#39;t make any sense but we do</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">them because because why and</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">and somewhere in there is for me this</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s really relevant that we are talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">about family</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">and the way that family is at the core</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">of systems change and and it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:36.960" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">some of the family members you may not</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.960" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">be in communication with you may they</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">may be dead and gone</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">you know generations ago but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">moving through us and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">the ways in which i might respond in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">how much of that is me</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">and how much of that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">something that that came before and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">that attention like so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:10.839" style="s2">happened in that moment with my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">was there was attention</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.839" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">to what i saw in her fiery self</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">was actually that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">if i laid that down in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">i was gonna set something</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">and that thing that was going to get set</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">was going to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">a pivot in what it was possible to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">communicate</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">for i don&#39;t know how many years in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">future so it wasn&#39;t what was</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">communicated</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">that was communicated it was what was</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">to communicate that was communicated if</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">so it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t that i just</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t say the thing it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">between the two of us we had a moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">where we went somewhere else entirely</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">and that meant that from then on that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">door was open</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">right and that is a shifting a whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">shifting of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">of you know of of the possible</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">and and that happens in in one second</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">if you i had one second to see that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:23.599" style="s2">so how many generations did it take</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">to prepare for that one minute when i</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.599" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">there and how to share that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">right so that we don&#39;t have to wait</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:33.200" style="s2">several generations</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s there it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just that sometimes you can&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">since i&#39;ve become a mom um</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been obsessed with this question of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">how how do we raise</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">the new human you know because i</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">witnessed this</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">new consciousness come and come on to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">earth into his</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">body i&#39;ve been um</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">facilitating that helping him out in</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">this process</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">um so it is constantly that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">hold this question how do i not</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">bog him down uh with the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">social and the personal limitations that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">carry</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">so that he can fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">so that he can fully potentiate</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">uh to exist to function</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">and hopefully even flourish in a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">troubling</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">world that he&#39;s inheriting at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">um you know from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">world side that is inheriting i have no</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">idea what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">i just have a sense that it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">to be easy at</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">all so then</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:22.720" style="s2">planes of existence at the concrete</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">level like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:28.800" style="s2">bodily you know nervous system level</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">um at the emotional regulation and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.800" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">know thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.839" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">processed level and at the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">um how do i set a foundation that allows</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">a human who can flourish</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">regardless of of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">or he knows how to make the choices</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">that will allow him</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">the environment that he&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:09.119" style="s2">um which is planet earth you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">um like how does he then also become</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.119" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">an agent of uh movement in the right</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:15.440" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">because we need to be doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.440" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll just leave it at that for now</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.520" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">between two and eleven at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">and how they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">almost all of their energy does</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">go into exploration</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">and learning and figuring things out</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">amazing to see just from</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">let&#39;s say my generation to them</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">at least for my family how</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">less they are burdened by by the past</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:28.240" style="s2">like they&#39;re just there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t have many of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:39.359" style="s2">scripts that were used at least when i</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">was young</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.359" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">kind of uh imprinted like every day</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">for years on end and they have way more</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:53.200" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">and way more parents like</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.200" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">h.a and skye and miriam</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">and so i see there</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">a lot more potential that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">be developed</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">and is developing from when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">just a couple of months old and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">in the beginning i was surprised and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">was i thought it was exceptional but</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">now that the high of seven it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">yeah so in that way it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">also hopeful at least for</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">the kids who can grow up in that way i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">not saying it&#39;s happening everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s what i see from my</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.839" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">i have six kids in my life um two</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">are from my body and four are my</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">from my husband&#39;s previous</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">marriages and um</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:14.480" style="s2">i have been i was raised by somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">actually was aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.480" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">interdependencies and systems and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">this stuff that we&#39;re talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">i had a model um i had it i</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">had um i didn&#39;t know what that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">but you don&#39;t have to know because what</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">happens with parenting what happens</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">across generations</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">is not explicit it&#39;s it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">it&#39;s an indirect communication that this</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">that this really gets transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">um and my kids i was careful</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">and i paid attention and i was on it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">i knew they&#39;re coming into a world</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">that&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">and i did all sorts of things i could</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">tell you hours of stories about them</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">um but but i can tell you one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">i didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">which was that in all of my workings</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">in all kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">i didn&#39;t really take into account</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">not only their ability to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">world that was changing</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">but that they were going to be in really</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">close relationships</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">with other people who didn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.160" end="00:52:29.920" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">okay this was a piece that i missed</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.920" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">and um and it was it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">of course i was always you know modeling</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:41.040" style="s2">thing of being in relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">having communication</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.040" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">but what happens when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">relationship with people who have no</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">notion about being an expert</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">and this is something that i have pushed</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:52.960" style="s2">hard on</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">with my with my in my whole life because</p>

<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">this idea that only adults of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">kind of</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:06.720" style="s2">complexity i&#39;m calling</p>

<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">my kids all got it all the people that i</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">with around the world that have you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:16.960" style="s2">no education whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">they get it and part of it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.960" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">this thing of going through the dark</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:25.280" style="s2">night of meeting</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:27.520" style="s2">real difficulty in life and recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t single cause that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.520" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">is multiple that there are all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">processes that are all around it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s it i mean that&#39;s the stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">so this to me seems like the thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">and we&#39;re looking at the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">and what do we see</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:50.839" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be going along a road</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;s going to ask them to actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.839" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">um be in a kind of grace</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">with extreme difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">it already is and they&#39;re multiple</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">layers and they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">more than one at a time and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">that i mean ultimately it requires a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:15.920" style="s2">of love and a sense of humor</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:19.119" style="s2">and a a you know a keen intellect</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.920" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">and a lot of compassion and empathy and</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">i&#39;d like to jump in because um at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">nora offered a beautiful weekly call for</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:42.640" style="s2">about schooling last spring when none of</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.640" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">and i&#39;ve learned so much from her in</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">this regard and that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">that was beautiful um so</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">yeah i mean the one thing i&#39;ll add and</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">advice or bad advice but</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">we have a saying my daughter and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">that there are rules there are capital r</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:08.160" style="s2">rules and there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">small r rules and she&#39;s been brought up</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.160" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">mostly in brooklyn in new york city</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">and i&#39;m often</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:17.920" style="s2">pointing out to her like she has a very</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">different relationship to authority i</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.920" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">guess is where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:23.280" style="s2">kind of going with this um in part</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:26.079" style="s2">because she&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">the political shenanigans as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.079" end="00:56:28.640" style="s2">nine-year-old it&#39;s incredible like she</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">sees</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.640" end="00:56:35.599" style="s2">right through um and</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">and we talk a lot in the city about and</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.599" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">with school</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">as she goes to a public school</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.839" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">and there have been times when i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">really that&#39;s really been hard for me</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">and then there have been times when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">been an incredible opportunity to teach</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">her a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">about which rules she needs to follow</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">and which rules</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t necessarily need to follow and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">i model that a lot um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">uh yeah yeah i think i think that&#39;s it i</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:06.079" style="s2">you know her relationship to authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">is very very</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">very different and her inner authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:12.799" style="s2">is really what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">nurture in her because i foresee also</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.799" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to be an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:19.359" style="s2">um i don&#39;t even know what the word is</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">challenging probably doesn&#39;t capture it</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.359" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">at the at the end of the day i want her</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:25.680" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:27.520" style="s2">because she came in this way anyway like</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:30.160" style="s2">very strongly in her center</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">and very perceptive and i like a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.160" end="00:57:33.359" style="s2">no-nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">and i see that in a lot of children</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">actually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:38.240" style="s2">very aware of the climate situation we</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.240" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">mentioned that overtly but they feel it</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">they already have a sense um for what</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">dealing with she&#39;s been to so many</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">marches she has a favorite march</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:55.760" style="s2">um so you know she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">really engaged and really navigating by</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.760" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">her own inner authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i try to nurture</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.480" end="00:58:10.559" style="s2">i do we still have time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">so um just first i love your question</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.559" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve been bathing in it since you asked</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">it bonita</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been kind of looking in my</p>

<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:21.359" style="s2">with that question not actually she&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">school right now but like</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.359" end="00:58:24.799" style="s2">in in my imagination i&#39;ve been looking</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:26.559" style="s2">in her eyes and just looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.799" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">future that i see in there</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.559" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a few things</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.079" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">because she&#39;s 17 wow nora when you spoke</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">it like it was such a</p>

<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">parenting now</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">and knowing that the future is this</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">my heart</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:56.000" style="s2">in a very visceral way and and we have</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">since she was born been working so hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.000" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">to recreate culture in our family and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">in our greater family and community and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.240" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">um but god it it&#39;s slow</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s slow so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">of heartache there</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">um there&#39;s there&#39;s actually i have fear</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">too um but when i look into her</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:18.640" style="s2">eyes and look at the future that she is</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">starting to embody</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">there there are some things there one is</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">her capacity for discernment blows me</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:28.000" style="s2">away so and i&#39;ve heard that now um</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">you know this sort of the clarity the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.000" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">seeing through the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">um and nora was really moved by hearing</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:35.839" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:36.559" style="s2">experience of having older kids now and</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.839" end="00:59:39.680" style="s2">how they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.559" end="00:59:41.520" style="s2">met in the way that they were met and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.680" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">this has started for my daughter ever</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.520" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">since she homeschooled um with us</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">until she was 14 but as soon as she went</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">to um public school she started</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">experiencing that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">that she was not being met the way she</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">was met at home</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">and with her peers in the homeschooling</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="00:59:59.520" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:02.000" style="s2">and what what that is like to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.520" end="01:00:04.319" style="s2">and how early grief can set in around</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.000" end="01:00:06.799" style="s2">that and the kind of grief that i meet</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.319" end="01:00:07.920" style="s2">in myself on a daily basis she was</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:11.599" style="s2">meeting at age</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.920" end="01:00:14.559" style="s2">you know 14 15. um but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.599" end="01:00:16.400" style="s2">also that i see in her that i i gives me</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.559" end="01:00:20.720" style="s2">a lot of hope and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.400" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">future where her sensitivity as in her</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.720" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">we raised her so that i feel like she</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">really didn&#39;t have to shut down much</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">like her</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">her open pores were able to stay very</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:30.240" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:32.319" style="s2">and at the same time we&#39;ve attempted and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.240" end="01:00:32.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s an ongoing experiment like</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.319" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">she&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.880" end="01:00:36.000" style="s2">growing up but we&#39;ve attempted to build</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:38.079" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.000" end="01:00:40.000" style="s2">within her with her a sturdiness from</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.079" end="01:00:43.119" style="s2">the from the inside</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.000" end="01:00:44.079" style="s2">so rather than shut down or protect the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.119" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.079" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">actually to match that with an inner</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:51.280" style="s2">sturdiness and i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">a resilience in her that also has</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.280" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">given me a lot of hope when i look at</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">the future in her eyes</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">because i i can see her already having</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:01:01.839" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.839" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">um some you know some some smaller but</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.839" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">some some small dark nights of her soul</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">how she has already been able within a</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:12.079" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">two year time frame being able to take</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.079" end="01:01:15.839" style="s2">in the insights</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">learn the lessons and and literally</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.839" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">embody</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">the theory like she got it and now she</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.760" end="01:01:23.040" style="s2">acting differently in relationships so</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:26.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">the quick turnaround um that also</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.240" end="01:01:31.359" style="s2">gives gives me certainly a lot of hope</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:34.000" style="s2">when i consider the future but</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.359" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to end on this in difficult</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">note maybe but but it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:40.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s that i feel in the teenage</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">years right now and the teams that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.960" end="01:01:44.960" style="s2">aware of</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">um that i&#39;m meeting through her there</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.960" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">is a not taking for granted that there</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">is a future</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s it it it i think it&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a great grief that is running</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.000" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">through them that they maybe have words</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">for and maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">but that is very different i think than</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:06.079" style="s2">what i remember</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:08.480" style="s2">when i was growing up i knew there were</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.079" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">big threats but i i felt assured of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.480" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">and so um yeah i just want to maybe add</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:18.319" style="s2">in the context which i know we all hold</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:21.839" style="s2">so closely to ourselves but</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.319" end="01:02:23.680" style="s2">how much it really this is not just an</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.839" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">exercise that we need to bring theory</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.680" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">into embodiment this is like</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2"> sorry maybe you should use that</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">word this really really matters</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.000" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">okay i think i&#39;m talking to everyone who</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">knows this but i&#39;m just going to say it</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:39.440" style="s2">so the universe hears it more</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:40.559" style="s2">it really really matters that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">actually start</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.559" end="01:02:44.640" style="s2">living in our cells in our bones in our</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:47.599" style="s2">minds our hearts</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.640" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">our spirits our souls like we we bring</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.599" end="01:02:50.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">to life that that we feel the future is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.880" end="01:02:53.440" style="s2">calling for</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.599" end="01:02:56.319" style="s2">because that might actually make a</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.440" end="01:02:56.319" style="s2">future possible</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.079" end="01:03:04.319" style="s2">well so i would like to take up this</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">topic on another high pitch</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">session i think this is this is really</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.000" end="01:03:13.359" style="s2">uh this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:15.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know what to say this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.359" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">really what&#39;s what&#39;s very important and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.520" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">unsolved it&#39;s not it&#39;s not being taken</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">up and it&#39;s not solved</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.359" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">and i think the people that are here uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">are the people that are working on it i</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">mean no no for sure miriam this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:32.640" style="s2">basically your life&#39;s work actually is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">part of it now</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.640" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">um and for me it&#39;s very uh interesting</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:39.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:43.520" style="s2">and i&#39;ll just kind of wrap up with this</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.640" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">non-personal but more of a conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.520" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">einstein predicted this he said the rate</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:50.240" style="s2">change the rate of the change in</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:53.520" style="s2">knowledge would be so</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.240" end="01:03:55.280" style="s2">accelerated that from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.520" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2">the children the parents would live in</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.280" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">the past</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.200" end="01:04:01.200" style="s2">and then he said so then what is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:03.599" style="s2">role of adults and educators</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.200" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be faced with teaching</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.599" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">your child an</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">unknown and unknowable future</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">and for me as an educator one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">i teach one of the principles i take</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:17.440" style="s2">from this is that if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.079" end="01:04:19.440" style="s2">education today</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.440" end="01:04:23.280" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly trying to teach</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.440" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">children the lessons that we learned</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.280" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">and this is completely irrelevant to</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:29.359" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:29.760" style="s2">so first we have to put the problem in</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.359" end="01:04:32.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.760" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">and then show them how to solve it and</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.880" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">the problems they face</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:39.680" style="s2">we haven&#39;t learned only they can learn</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:42.240" style="s2">to solve them</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.680" end="01:04:44.079" style="s2">so this transforms the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.240" end="01:04:46.960" style="s2">between the adult and the child</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.079" end="01:04:48.079" style="s2">and the teacher and the student and</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.960" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">that&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.079" end="01:04:54.160" style="s2">i would really like to</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">have one of these conversations around</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.160" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">with you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.760" end="01:05:03.119" style="s2">now i know we didn&#39;t get uh time for</p>
