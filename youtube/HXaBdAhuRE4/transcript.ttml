<p begin="00:00:36.550" end="00:00:42.769" style="s2">understanding disagreement and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.769" end="00:00:45.079" style="s2">the first question should be why are we</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.769" end="00:00:46.399" style="s2">yelling that&#39;s a great question to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.079" end="00:00:48.979" style="s2">with let me thank you for inviting me</p>

<p begin="00:00:48.979" end="00:00:52.909" style="s2">we yelling it&#39;s because we&#39;re we feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:54.589" style="s2">stuck we feel frustrated about being</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.909" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">stuck we feel like everything we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.589" end="00:00:57.979" style="s2">tried has failed</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:59.359" style="s2">and we feel like we put out our good</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.979" end="00:01:00.499" style="s2">will and we&#39;ve tried to do the right</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.359" end="00:01:02.629" style="s2">thing multiple times and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.499" end="00:01:04.610" style="s2">stomped on like all of these things have</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.629" end="00:01:06.110" style="s2">made us resentful about trying to reach</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.610" end="00:01:08.390" style="s2">out again and have productive</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.110" end="00:01:10.700" style="s2">disagreements so you know what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.390" end="00:01:12.440" style="s2">if we feel like we have no other option</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.700" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">you know we can yell into our pillows we</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.440" end="00:01:15.380" style="s2">can yell into Twitter we can do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:16.610" style="s2">we could do all that kind of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.380" end="00:01:17.990" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re yelling right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.610" end="00:01:19.670" style="s2">I really enjoyed some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.990" end="00:01:21.230" style="s2">distinctions that you draw in the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.670" end="00:01:24.740" style="s2">between different kinds of disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.230" end="00:01:27.410" style="s2">and different strategies and want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.740" end="00:01:29.990" style="s2">tease those out but I want to start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.410" end="00:01:32.890" style="s2">one that you talked about productive</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.990" end="00:01:36.020" style="s2">disagreement as being a meta skill and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.890" end="00:01:38.990" style="s2">we never miss a a chance to go meta on</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.020" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">this channel so what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.990" end="00:01:43.940" style="s2">and what is productive disagreement as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:45.290" style="s2">meta skill yes so a better skill is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.940" end="00:01:47.960" style="s2">skill that makes all of your other</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.290" end="00:01:50.420" style="s2">skills better or more likely to progress</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.960" end="00:01:51.980" style="s2">and grow faster and you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.420" end="00:01:53.630" style="s2">also think of as psycho technology you</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.980" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">can think of it as a superpower it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.630" end="00:01:57.409" style="s2">really you know similar to you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:59.060" style="s2">learning how to read learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.409" end="00:02:00.710" style="s2">talk you&#39;re learning a new language all</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.060" end="00:02:03.050" style="s2">of these things once you learn them you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.710" end="00:02:05.530" style="s2">can now acquire new skills much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.050" end="00:02:08.390" style="s2">rapidly and we know what can make us</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.530" end="00:02:09.739" style="s2">even acquire skills even faster</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.390" end="00:02:10.819" style="s2">obviously working through our</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.739" end="00:02:12.349" style="s2">disagreements working through our</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.819" end="00:02:14.310" style="s2">problems and seeing what&#39;s on the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.349" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">side of a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.310" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">duck conversations like we desperately</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">need some of that the word and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:24.270" style="s2">concept of psycho technology seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">like it seems incredibly useful John Bob</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.270" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">a key I think is kind of given it to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:31.739" style="s2">as a concept and it&#39;s like language as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:34.349" style="s2">psycho technology many of our habits of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.739" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">thought are psycho technology their ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.349" end="00:02:38.489" style="s2">of dealing with problems and what are</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:40.410" style="s2">the key psycho technologies that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.489" end="00:02:43.620" style="s2">think we need for difficult</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.410" end="00:02:46.530" style="s2">conversations or productive disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.620" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">as you called it yeah I think the art of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.530" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">productive disagreement is a technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">a psycho technology in this sense right</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">this disagreement is when two worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">or perspectives are differ and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">so the psycho technology I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:04.200" style="s2">advance is the one where we can move</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:07.110" style="s2">into that space of differences different</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">worldviews and come out of it smarter</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.110" end="00:03:13.019" style="s2">more connected you know having enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:14.160" style="s2">the time if we can such that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.019" end="00:03:15.989" style="s2">the problems that we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.160" end="00:03:17.580" style="s2">don&#39;t you know I often say that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.989" end="00:03:18.600" style="s2">stuck arguing at the gate of many of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.580" end="00:03:20.489" style="s2">these problems we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:22.320" style="s2">whether or not the problem exists not</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.489" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">how to solve it and we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.320" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">through that gate which productive</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">disagreement can help us do so that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:29.819" style="s2">can solve the problems and can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">about your personal background with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.819" end="00:03:34.079" style="s2">because you do describe in the book how</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">the Trump election was a real kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.079" end="00:03:37.890" style="s2">awakening moment as it was for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:40.140" style="s2">people certainly on the more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.890" end="00:03:42.829" style="s2">side of the spectrum so can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.140" end="00:03:45.049" style="s2">about that that kind of it was that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.829" end="00:03:47.549" style="s2">connected with the origin of the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.049" end="00:03:50.310" style="s2">100% yeah that was I&#39;ve always prided</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.549" end="00:03:51.930" style="s2">myself on being a civil disagree or you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.310" end="00:03:54.200" style="s2">know someone that can talk to people I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.930" end="00:03:56.700" style="s2">disagree with without resorting to anger</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.200" end="00:03:58.620" style="s2">it turns out though that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.700" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">enough right I have these group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.620" end="00:04:03.329" style="s2">friends and we discussed the election</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:05.700" style="s2">politics situation happening all the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.329" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">up through illiac election and after it</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.700" end="00:04:10.019" style="s2">happened I was unable to talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:13.950" style="s2">anymore and so I felt like I had failed</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.019" end="00:04:15.720" style="s2">to relate to them to understand them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.950" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">actually have a conversation and I ended</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.720" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">up just being feeling lost and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:23.010" style="s2">if if we feel lost in our closest</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:24.150" style="s2">relationships because we can&#39;t connect</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.010" end="00:04:26.159" style="s2">with them and can&#39;t talk about our</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.150" end="00:04:27.870" style="s2">disagreements like what are the chances</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.159" end="00:04:30.030" style="s2">that I&#39;ll ever be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.870" end="00:04:32.220" style="s2">with you know a co-worker or a family</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.030" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">member or someone that I work with or</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.220" end="00:04:35.550" style="s2">you know someone I run into on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:37.320" style="s2">street so it was an eye-opening moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.550" end="00:04:39.150" style="s2">for me to realize that I was I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.320" end="00:04:41.130" style="s2">was good at this it turns out I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.150" end="00:04:44.130" style="s2">and I had a lot of work to do to figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.130" end="00:04:47.460" style="s2">it out and I like in the in the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.130" end="00:04:49.380" style="s2">that you talk about running towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.460" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">disagreement or using disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.380" end="00:04:53.100" style="s2">productively where are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">how would you recommend people do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.100" end="00:04:57.630" style="s2">and where are you doing that at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:05:00.389" style="s2">moment in your life yeah it&#39;s so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.630" end="00:05:02.729" style="s2">this is this is the most surprising</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.389" end="00:05:04.169" style="s2">thing to me is that I now my eyes light</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.729" end="00:05:06.780" style="s2">up when someone is like I disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.169" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">you but that&#39;s gonna be fun you know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.780" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">that could seem facetious I guess if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:14.940" style="s2">know you don&#39;t know me but it&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">I think that we do need to find that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.940" end="00:05:18.840" style="s2">right level of disagreement to help us</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.370" end="00:05:20.760" style="s2">grow like we have to develop each</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.840" end="00:05:22.860" style="s2">other&#39;s skill in this but once you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.760" end="00:05:24.150" style="s2">you know things that I&#39;ve done I know</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.860" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">I&#39;m in several Facebook groups for</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.150" end="00:05:27.389" style="s2">example where I&#39;m the only liberal</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:29.760" style="s2">person the only progressive person and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.389" end="00:05:31.889" style="s2">my goal is to really just see the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.760" end="00:05:33.780" style="s2">from somebody else&#39;s perspective get</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.889" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">into a build some relationships and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.780" end="00:05:37.770" style="s2">have these conversations you know I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.090" style="s2">a couple of those I&#39;m in like a you know</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.800" end="00:07:41.169" style="s2">belief about ghosts has radically</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:43.000" style="s2">shifted and I&#39;m now like really into the</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.139" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">in the sense of not feeling like I knew</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.210" end="00:08:23.979" style="s2">how to do it which meant inviting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:25.750" style="s2">of people to have conversations with me</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.979" end="00:08:27.190" style="s2">and I opened up a lot of different I</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.750" end="00:08:28.449" style="s2">called a lot of my friends and said like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.190" end="00:08:30.880" style="s2">okay you know how we always argue about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.449" end="00:08:32.200" style="s2">this let&#39;s have that argument and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.240" end="00:08:41.890" style="s2">groups I created a discourse community</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.570" end="00:08:48.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t work and it was through that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.399" end="00:08:49.810" style="s2">process that you know I I&#39;ve discovered</p>

<p begin="00:08:51.160" end="00:08:56.290" style="s2">helped translate that into practical</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:14.079" style="s2">will achieve I hope people will look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">a disagreement as a practice you know in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.079" end="00:09:18.670" style="s2">the same way that meditation or going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:20.620" style="s2">the gym is and find their skill level</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:24.069" style="s2">and start practicing because before</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.620" end="00:09:25.480" style="s2">until we can physically feel what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.069" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">like to have a productive disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.480" end="00:09:29.470" style="s2">and physically feel both our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:31.029" style="s2">stretching and sort of seeing something</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.470" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">differently and sort of seeing how it</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.029" end="00:09:35.529" style="s2">brings you together with other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:37.180" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to be able to expect</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.529" end="00:09:39.759" style="s2">that of other people and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.180" end="00:09:41.500" style="s2">one of the you know the crucial elements</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.759" end="00:09:43.060" style="s2">that&#39;s missing in our debates right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.500" end="00:09:44.550" style="s2">is we don&#39;t expect our politicians and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.060" end="00:09:46.870" style="s2">our leaders to have productive debates</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.550" end="00:09:49.209" style="s2">the way that we change our expectation</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.870" end="00:09:52.120" style="s2">is by first experiencing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.209" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">seeing why it&#39;s useful and then hoping</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.120" end="00:09:56.019" style="s2">that others also have it and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:58.029" style="s2">bottoms up sort of change in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.019" end="00:10:00.819" style="s2">that I hope happens and can you talk a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.029" end="00:10:02.649" style="s2">bit about your background why you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.819" end="00:10:05.259" style="s2">the book and where what the origins of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.649" end="00:10:06.910" style="s2">it were yeah so my background is from</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.259" end="00:10:09.939" style="s2">the tech world I was an Amazon Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.910" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">slack hitting a bunch of startups and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.939" end="00:10:14.189" style="s2">job as a product leader has always been</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:16.600" style="s2">to facilitate you know diverse</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.189" end="00:10:19.689" style="s2">collections of people and get them to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.600" end="00:10:22.209" style="s2">coordinate and produce something on time</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.689" end="00:10:25.389" style="s2">and actually achieve the results that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.209" end="00:10:26.980" style="s2">you want and so inadvertently I found</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.389" end="00:10:29.829" style="s2">that a lot of these skills could</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.980" end="00:10:31.689" style="s2">translate to all kinds of other aspects</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.829" end="00:10:33.910" style="s2">of our lives from the relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.689" end="00:10:35.889" style="s2">our work to politics to you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.910" end="00:10:37.720" style="s2">everything else the friendships and even</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.889" end="00:10:39.880" style="s2">at our own self-talk you know can can</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.720" end="00:10:42.459" style="s2">benefit from this kind of stuff so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.880" end="00:10:43.750" style="s2">was the impetus and when I took stock of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.459" end="00:10:46.509" style="s2">you know what I could do to have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.750" end="00:10:47.769" style="s2">positive impact after the election this</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.509" end="00:10:49.629" style="s2">was an area where I thought there was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.769" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">big enough gap in knowledge and I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.629" end="00:10:53.559" style="s2">sort of you know I felt like I was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:55.059" style="s2">right person to be doing this that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.559" end="00:10:57.399" style="s2">is a better use of my time than almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.059" end="00:10:59.110" style="s2">anything else I could be doing and also</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.399" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">in the book you mentioned the hidden</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.110" end="00:11:04.280" style="s2">disagreements are worse than surfaced</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:06.420" style="s2">ones which i think is a really important</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.280" end="00:11:10.190" style="s2">realization and it reminded me of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.420" end="00:11:12.960" style="s2">saying my good friend raffia talks about</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.190" end="00:11:14.130" style="s2">everything registers in the field and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.960" end="00:11:16.590" style="s2">this is sort of more from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.130" end="00:11:18.390" style="s2">personal growth perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.590" end="00:11:20.400" style="s2">everything on some level everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.390" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">that&#39;s going on is registered and is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.400" end="00:11:26.040" style="s2">aware and playing out in the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:27.420" style="s2">somewhere so from a maybe sort of less</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.040" end="00:11:29.520" style="s2">sort of personal growth orientated</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.420" end="00:11:31.050" style="s2">perspective how would you frame that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.520" end="00:11:34.740" style="s2">what why do you think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:37.710" style="s2">important framework yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.740" end="00:11:39.870" style="s2">you know the there is as I was writing</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.710" end="00:11:41.250" style="s2">this book I was assuming that we would</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.870" end="00:11:42.570" style="s2">just I would be practicing having</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.250" end="00:11:44.370" style="s2">unproductive disagreement and making</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.570" end="00:11:45.720" style="s2">them productive what actually turned out</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.370" end="00:11:47.820" style="s2">to be the case was that people had</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.720" end="00:11:49.860" style="s2">already given up with disagreements we</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.820" end="00:11:52.140" style="s2">are we are okay with ranting and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.860" end="00:11:53.460" style="s2">okay with doing zingers and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.140" end="00:11:55.140" style="s2">making lists I&#39;d feel bad but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.460" end="00:11:58.530" style="s2">actually in dialogue with the people we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.140" end="00:12:00.330" style="s2">disagree with across many different sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.530" end="00:12:02.940" style="s2">of dimensions and that was the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.330" end="00:12:04.410" style="s2">surprising thing and I also read um and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.940" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">willful blindness by Margaret Heffron</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.410" end="00:12:08.700" style="s2">and I believe her surname and she found</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:10.400" style="s2">that like 85% of people in a job</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.700" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">situation or in a relationship situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.400" end="00:12:14.520" style="s2">know that something is wrong that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">they&#39;re afraid to talk about and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.520" end="00:12:18.600" style="s2">really just putting things below the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:20.100" style="s2">surface under the rug and they don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.600" end="00:12:21.690" style="s2">away and they&#39;re in the field and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.100" end="00:12:23.880" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna come back in some way</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.690" end="00:12:25.770" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna grow they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.880" end="00:12:27.780" style="s2">accumulate and soon that small problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.770" end="00:12:30.270" style="s2">again turn into a big problem and be</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.780" end="00:12:34.230" style="s2">harder to resolve at that point yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.270" end="00:12:35.970" style="s2">just you you said that we weren&#39;t having</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.230" end="00:12:37.320" style="s2">disagreements people were just sitting</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.970" end="00:12:41.570" style="s2">on them do you think that that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.320" end="00:12:44.670" style="s2">kind of exhaustion or maybe sort of post</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.570" end="00:12:46.470" style="s2">post trump election kind of we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.670" end="00:12:47.790" style="s2">enough disagreements and now we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.470" end="00:12:48.410" style="s2">sitting on it what what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.790" end="00:12:50.370" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.410" end="00:12:52.200" style="s2">absolutely yeah I think lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.370" end="00:12:53.580" style="s2">exhaustion the lack of energy the fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.200" end="00:12:54.810" style="s2">that we&#39;re all feeling really anxious we</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.580" end="00:12:56.970" style="s2">don&#39;t want to add more to that to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.810" end="00:12:58.410" style="s2">pile but also I think it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.970" end="00:13:01.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive spin to it as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.410" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">which is historically you know how if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.380" end="00:13:05.400" style="s2">do resolve disagreements we&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:07.290" style="s2">force you know my might is right to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.400" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">resolve disagreements and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.290" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re not doing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:13.590" style="s2">is as good except for some extremists</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:14.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve always thought that reason was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.590" end="00:13:16.140" style="s2">way that we&#39;re going to resolve our</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.550" end="00:13:17.700" style="s2">disagreements but it turns out that only</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.140" end="00:13:19.620" style="s2">works when you&#39;re both appealing</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.700" end="00:13:21.090" style="s2">to the same source of truth and the sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.620" end="00:13:23.580" style="s2">of state authority and when you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.090" end="00:13:25.740" style="s2">across tribes you don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.580" end="00:13:27.540" style="s2">authority and trust in that authority of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.740" end="00:13:28.890" style="s2">different sources for information and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.540" end="00:13:30.330" style="s2">that&#39;s not working either and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.890" end="00:13:32.760" style="s2">like well this doesn&#39;t work that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.330" end="00:13:35.430" style="s2">work I got nothing I&#39;m gonna stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.760" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">anything and plus I&#39;m tired and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.430" end="00:13:38.970" style="s2">question I think it&#39;s it&#39;s good to admit</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:41.130" style="s2">that the two things aren&#39;t working but</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.970" end="00:13:42.870" style="s2">the thing I would you know I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.130" end="00:13:44.790" style="s2">encourage us to go one step further and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.870" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">have curiosity about you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.790" end="00:13:48.660" style="s2">the what are we missing like why is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:49.980" style="s2">so hard to resolve what is it about our</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.660" end="00:13:51.900" style="s2">culture right now that is or our</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.980" end="00:13:54.570" style="s2">relationship right now that&#39;s preventing</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.900" end="00:13:55.740" style="s2">us from communicating and we got to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.570" end="00:13:57.750" style="s2">build new skills to do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.740" end="00:14:00.660" style="s2">and I think that opens up a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.750" end="00:14:02.430" style="s2">Vista of possibilities in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.660" end="00:14:04.680" style="s2">we relate to each other that are worth</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.430" end="00:14:07.500" style="s2">exploring do you have any theories about</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.680" end="00:14:09.060" style="s2">that why it is now that things are so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.500" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">much more seem to be so much more</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.060" end="00:14:14.220" style="s2">difficult part of it is we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:17.520" style="s2">the skills we&#39;re in an arena where the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.220" end="00:14:20.760" style="s2">the difficulty of the conversations is</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.520" end="00:14:22.260" style="s2">way beyond our skill level and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.760" end="00:14:23.430" style="s2">sort of like being thrown you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.260" end="00:14:25.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve never done any public speaking</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.430" end="00:14:27.570" style="s2">you&#39;re thrown on stage at the Rose Bowl</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.500" end="00:14:29.790" style="s2">or something and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.570" end="00:14:32.550" style="s2">intimidating and so you resort to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.790" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">know defensive sort of things that will</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.550" end="00:14:36.600" style="s2">save your dignity a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:38.070" style="s2">oftentimes getting angry isn&#39;t as a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.600" end="00:14:39.300" style="s2">to do that and being negative as a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.070" end="00:14:41.070" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.300" end="00:14:42.540" style="s2">and so we have to be able to get onto</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.070" end="00:14:46.260" style="s2">that stage you know maybe it starts with</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.540" end="00:14:49.830" style="s2">a smaller stage and you know not freeze</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.260" end="00:14:51.000" style="s2">and not lash out but actually continue</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.830" end="00:14:52.350" style="s2">being up there and be like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.000" end="00:14:54.030" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.350" end="00:14:56.700" style="s2">about this I wonder what we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.030" end="00:14:57.810" style="s2">from each other and and then do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.700" end="00:14:59.100" style="s2">until you&#39;re really good at it and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.810" end="00:15:01.710" style="s2">move to the next arrow sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.100" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">difficulty level and you&#39;re you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.710" end="00:15:04.950" style="s2">of in the center of Silicon Valley and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:07.140" style="s2">have worked in the tech industry do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.950" end="00:15:09.870" style="s2">think the tech industry is at least</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.140" end="00:15:12.150" style="s2">partially to blame for this absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.870" end="00:15:14.850" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;re so complicit</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.150" end="00:15:16.470" style="s2">and I had this real awakening when I you</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.850" end="00:15:17.820" style="s2">know I&#39;ve always been an idealist and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.470" end="00:15:19.380" style="s2">growing up and that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.820" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">brought me to tech was this possibility</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.380" end="00:15:24.870" style="s2">of you know connecting the world and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:26.490" style="s2">sort of giving everyone a voice and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.870" end="00:15:29.550" style="s2">didn&#39;t think about the side effects as</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.490" end="00:15:31.140" style="s2">much and that is something we definitely</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.550" end="00:15:31.620" style="s2">have to reckon with and I feel complicit</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.140" end="00:15:33.180" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.620" end="00:15:35.790" style="s2">in you know the various roles I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.180" end="00:15:37.670" style="s2">directly and just indirectly by being</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.790" end="00:15:41.100" style="s2">you know a participant in that ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.670" end="00:15:43.980" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s a lot of people here</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.100" end="00:15:47.130" style="s2">I&#39;m not the only one by far that has</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.980" end="00:15:48.930" style="s2">come to this realization that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.130" end="00:15:51.630" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s we thought what we thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.930" end="00:15:54.660" style="s2">was wrong and we have to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.630" end="00:15:55.830" style="s2">to do now house mmm and you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.660" end="00:15:57.570" style="s2">hinted at it there but you think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.830" end="00:15:59.100" style="s2">feeling is quite widespread and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.570" end="00:16:01.529" style="s2">what are the conversations are going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.100" end="00:16:03.210" style="s2">in in Silicon Valley now around this</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.529" end="00:16:05.640" style="s2">yeah I mean a lot of people are leaving</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.210" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">tech I think you know just state you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.640" end="00:16:08.190" style="s2">know I could clean myself you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:09.510" style="s2">writing a book is just so much more</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.190" end="00:16:10.980" style="s2">fulfilling to me than continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.510" end="00:16:13.130" style="s2">build these platforms that I feel you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.980" end="00:16:15.029" style="s2">know are potentially making things worse</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.130" end="00:16:18.510" style="s2">so a lot of people are leaving a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.029" end="00:16:20.310" style="s2">people are seeking smaller you know less</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.510" end="00:16:22.770" style="s2">ambitious goals you know just let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.310" end="00:16:24.930" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s step away from the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.770" end="00:16:26.250" style="s2">that is potentially a great good and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.930" end="00:16:28.650" style="s2">great bad at the same time and find</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.250" end="00:16:31.050" style="s2">something like you know let&#39;s just start</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.650" end="00:16:32.760" style="s2">a yoga studio or something and just</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.050" end="00:16:33.720" style="s2">finding this you know again like trying</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.760" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">to find the arena that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.720" end="00:16:40.170" style="s2">feel more confident in and just</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:41.730" style="s2">generally there&#39;s a lot of infighting</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.170" end="00:16:43.310" style="s2">you know any of these companies that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.730" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">go inside the walls you&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.310" end="00:16:48.360" style="s2">vastly polarized communities of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:50.250" style="s2">employees there that are fighting about</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.360" end="00:16:52.350" style="s2">this you can go anywhere and see that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.250" end="00:16:53.940" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s as visible from</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.350" end="00:16:55.170" style="s2">outside the tech world but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.940" end="00:16:56.760" style="s2">certainly there and you we saw it with</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.170" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">Google you know obviously in Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.760" end="00:17:01.620" style="s2">starting to have that I know Twitter has</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:04.530" style="s2">it and so they&#39;re not uniformly bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.620" end="00:17:07.500" style="s2">necessarily they&#39;re they&#39;ve done some</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.530" end="00:17:09.319" style="s2">you know damage to the world but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.500" end="00:17:12.630" style="s2">also people in there that care about</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.319" end="00:17:14.790" style="s2">maintaining that and fixing it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.630" end="00:17:16.290" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting situation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.790" end="00:17:18.089" style="s2">everyone has to decide where they want</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.290" end="00:17:20.339" style="s2">to be in that ecosystem if they can</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.089" end="00:17:23.490" style="s2">handle it or not you also talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.339" end="00:17:25.260" style="s2">in the book look how anxiety sparks in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.490" end="00:17:27.630" style="s2">you can you explain what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.260" end="00:17:30.810" style="s2">that and what what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.630" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">yeah so that I think that beginning the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.810" end="00:17:37.560" style="s2">first step we can take is to try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:39.990" style="s2">think about why we get angry why we feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.560" end="00:17:41.790" style="s2">anxious why we leap into disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.990" end="00:17:43.740" style="s2">you know the whole joke about someone on</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.790" end="00:17:45.990" style="s2">the Internet is wrong I have to go you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.740" end="00:17:48.540" style="s2">know tell them why they&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.990" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">why why have to do that what is and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.540" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">know what I found through just the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.100" end="00:17:53.670" style="s2">research and consulting with experts and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:55.350" style="s2">sort of reading a lot is and having</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.670" end="00:17:57.960" style="s2">conversations is that almost always you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.350" end="00:18:00.690" style="s2">can tie that anxiety back to a value in</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.960" end="00:18:01.860" style="s2">a belief that you personally have and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.690" end="00:18:04.200" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s a much better</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.860" end="00:18:06.030" style="s2">platform to then reach out and have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.200" end="00:18:07.470" style="s2">conversation about you know you can say</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.030" end="00:18:10.470" style="s2">like hey I feel threatened you know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.470" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">feel like maybe you don&#39;t respect the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:14.310" style="s2">same people that I do or you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.720" style="s2">know value the you know the humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.310" end="00:18:19.020" style="s2">these people as much as I do is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.720" end="00:18:21.090" style="s2">true and you can find out like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.020" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">they had that that was not on their mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.090" end="00:18:24.030" style="s2">at all maybe they were thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:25.530" style="s2">something completely else and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:27.660" style="s2">way to identify that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.530" end="00:18:29.160" style="s2">always like you know fightin shared</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.660" end="00:18:31.530" style="s2">common ground but how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.160" end="00:18:33.570" style="s2">well anxiety is the signpost that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.530" end="00:18:35.370" style="s2">sort of point you to the potential</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.570" end="00:18:37.980" style="s2">common ground to address so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.370" end="00:18:40.110" style="s2">mentioned the word curiosity before and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.980" end="00:18:41.910" style="s2">I think that that sort of come up again</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.110" end="00:18:44.220" style="s2">and again is a really important meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.910" end="00:18:46.470" style="s2">skill to develop we did a series of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.220" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">films and called the science and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.470" end="00:18:49.890" style="s2">psychology of polarization which could</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">have been called the science and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.890" end="00:18:55.850" style="s2">psychology of difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:58.140" style="s2">that used polyvagal theory and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.850" end="00:19:01.740" style="s2">somatic experiencing work that comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.140" end="00:19:03.510" style="s2">from trauma work and showing how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.740" end="00:19:05.010" style="s2">either in an exploratory frame of mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.510" end="00:19:07.320" style="s2">were open to new information or</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.010" end="00:19:10.860" style="s2">defensive frame of mind and how we flip</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.320" end="00:19:12.660" style="s2">between the two and the the key for get</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.860" end="00:19:15.420" style="s2">it potentially getting out of that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.660" end="00:19:17.970" style="s2">if we can become curious about our own</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.420" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">defensive nurse that literally can</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.970" end="00:19:22.260" style="s2">rewire our experience we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">start changing our own internal state</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.260" end="00:19:26.280" style="s2">and that can start changing it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:28.620" style="s2">think it&#39;s a kind of physiological hack</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.280" end="00:19:30.120" style="s2">that if if we were taught this more</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.620" end="00:19:33.000" style="s2">widely could really change our</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.120" end="00:19:34.410" style="s2">conversations what will you what firstly</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.000" end="00:19:36.630" style="s2">what you make of that work were you</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.410" end="00:19:40.010" style="s2">aware of like polyvagal theory and those</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.630" end="00:19:41.970" style="s2">frameworks before you wrote the book</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.010" end="00:19:43.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned about it from your channel</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.970" end="00:19:45.990" style="s2">a little bit that&#39;s played the extent</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.680" end="00:19:47.550" style="s2">that I know it but I there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.990" end="00:19:50.550" style="s2">conversations about psychological safety</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.550" end="00:19:52.590" style="s2">and curiosity and the especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.550" end="00:19:55.320" style="s2">tech world where you know and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.590" end="00:19:57.390" style="s2">acknowledgement that that is crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.320" end="00:19:59.130" style="s2">having high-performing teams and yet on</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.390" end="00:20:02.670" style="s2">the other side you want diverse</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.130" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">city so diversity and sort of having</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.670" end="00:20:08.160" style="s2">multiple perspectives to sort of broaden</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:09.750" style="s2">your your view of a problem is directly</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.160" end="00:20:10.710" style="s2">in tension with psychological safety</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.750" end="00:20:12.840" style="s2">because that&#39;s what makes you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.710" end="00:20:15.270" style="s2">potentially have challenges of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.840" end="00:20:16.590" style="s2">communication misunderstanding and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.270" end="00:20:18.330" style="s2">can spiral out of control so again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.590" end="00:20:20.160" style="s2">like this two sides of the coin you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.330" end="00:20:22.590" style="s2">to like make it a little bit safer make</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.160" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">it little more diverse and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.590" end="00:20:26.370" style="s2">you can&#39;t be curious unless you feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:28.740" style="s2">safe and you can&#39;t force yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.370" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">feel safe and so that that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.740" end="00:20:32.310" style="s2">think about like it&#39;s not just about you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:34.650" style="s2">and me talking it&#39;s also about what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.310" end="00:20:37.080" style="s2">the environment that we&#39;re in what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.650" end="00:20:39.000" style="s2">our power dynamic what is the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.080" end="00:20:41.040" style="s2">expectation about you know bringing</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.000" end="00:20:42.840" style="s2">ideas to the table inviting new people</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.040" end="00:20:44.700" style="s2">into the room that kind of stuff and all</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.840" end="00:20:46.830" style="s2">that kind of stuff can then trigger our</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.700" end="00:20:50.040" style="s2">psychology about you know are we safe</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.830" end="00:20:51.480" style="s2">can we be curious perhaps you can you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.040" end="00:20:54.300" style="s2">know if you&#39;re on the verge there you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.480" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">can jump into curiosity but it&#39;s a fine</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.300" end="00:20:59.460" style="s2">line mmm because I mean that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:02.040" style="s2">talking about diversity and I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.460" end="00:21:04.110" style="s2">of the big things with diversity is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.040" end="00:21:05.430" style="s2">ideological diversity which is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.110" end="00:21:07.860" style="s2">harder to measure than some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.430" end="00:21:09.330" style="s2">metrics and that maybe is where Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.860" end="00:21:12.840" style="s2">Valley has been criticized in the past</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.330" end="00:21:16.800" style="s2">of not having enough ideological or</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.840" end="00:21:18.300" style="s2">political diversity yep I did yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.800" end="00:21:20.850" style="s2">past and the present I believe you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.300" end="00:21:22.560" style="s2">that I think there&#39;s definitely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.850" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">hard you know it does because it</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.560" end="00:21:26.610" style="s2">challenges your safety and you we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:29.040" style="s2">we&#39;re all at this sort of feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.610" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">feeling threatened all the time already</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.040" end="00:21:34.290" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to then extend that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:35.490" style="s2">make it more the case so yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.290" end="00:21:37.380" style="s2">that there&#39;s that&#39;s another piece of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.490" end="00:21:40.260" style="s2">serious self-reflection that the tech</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.380" end="00:21:42.150" style="s2">world is doing and yet you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.260" end="00:21:43.710" style="s2">that easy to solve so it&#39;s not like we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.150" end="00:21:46.440" style="s2">can just admit it and then fix it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.710" end="00:21:47.700" style="s2">more systemic than that yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.440" end="00:21:49.110" style="s2">want to put you on the spot as the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.700" end="00:21:51.540" style="s2">representation of the whole tech</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.110" end="00:21:53.910" style="s2">industry so that would be really unfair</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.540" end="00:21:56.370" style="s2">thing to do yeah what did you make of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.910" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">the the sort of polyvagal frame did you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.370" end="00:22:02.040" style="s2">find it useful I do and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:04.440" style="s2">anyone that you know does meditation or</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.040" end="00:22:07.290" style="s2">yoga or things like that and you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.440" end="00:22:09.570" style="s2">can sort of sense when you shift and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.290" end="00:22:12.059" style="s2">think that becoming aware of that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.570" end="00:22:14.219" style="s2">crucial especially when you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.059" end="00:22:15.509" style="s2">ding from sort of safe conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.219" end="00:22:18.509" style="s2">disagreement there&#39;s always this moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.509" end="00:22:20.070" style="s2">where something flips and you turn into</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.509" end="00:22:21.869" style="s2">your shield and your sword and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.070" end="00:22:23.879" style="s2">like ready to fight and that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.869" end="00:22:25.859" style="s2">when the polyvagal you know I forget the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.879" end="00:22:28.710" style="s2">terms but like one flips to the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.859" end="00:22:29.940" style="s2">threatened state and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.710" end="00:22:31.710" style="s2">notice when that&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.940" end="00:22:33.539" style="s2">potentially shift it back that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.710" end="00:22:35.099" style="s2">probably the best time to do it rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.539" end="00:22:36.450" style="s2">than further down the line when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.099" end="00:22:38.179" style="s2">feeling even more threatened or more</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.450" end="00:22:40.499" style="s2">hurt as a result of the back-and-forth</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.179" end="00:22:43.109" style="s2">so yeah I think being aware of that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.499" end="00:22:45.629" style="s2">really important there&#39;s been a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.109" end="00:22:47.489" style="s2">other books coming out recently around</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.629" end="00:22:49.710" style="s2">this same topic like it feels like those</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.489" end="00:22:53.369" style="s2">that there&#39;s a real well of interest in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.710" end="00:22:54.539" style="s2">it as an area or inquiry and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.369" end="00:22:57.450" style="s2">was to how to have impossible</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.539" end="00:23:00.929" style="s2">conversations by Peter Bogosian and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.450" end="00:23:03.089" style="s2">James Lindsay I wonder what you you made</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.929" end="00:23:05.029" style="s2">of that I&#39;d say I&#39;ve read both books and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.089" end="00:23:09.149" style="s2">I&#39;d say that theirs is probably more</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.029" end="00:23:11.369" style="s2">conversational techniques tactics and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.149" end="00:23:13.139" style="s2">probably less goes less into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.369" end="00:23:15.179" style="s2">psychological realm and your book goes a</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.139" end="00:23:18.269" style="s2">little bit more into that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.179" end="00:23:20.129" style="s2">psychological area I mean they do talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.269" end="00:23:22.649" style="s2">about psychological safety but it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.129" end="00:23:25.289" style="s2">I&#39;d say that focus is more on strategies</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.649" end="00:23:26.519" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s true and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.289" end="00:23:30.089" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s great we need the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.519" end="00:23:33.119" style="s2">strategies to use in the moment but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.089" end="00:23:35.099" style="s2">also think we need to respect the fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.119" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot more going in like we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.099" end="00:23:39.749" style="s2">can&#39;t we can&#39;t just unroll the strategy</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:42.899" style="s2">list and do it right we have to also</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.749" end="00:23:46.169" style="s2">consider our emotions consider the sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.899" end="00:23:49.559" style="s2">of backdrop of the cultural divides that</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.169" end="00:23:51.599" style="s2">are happening and that means also being</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.559" end="00:23:53.999" style="s2">willing to self reflect and think about</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.599" end="00:23:56.519" style="s2">your own place and that and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.999" end="00:23:59.460" style="s2">always considered a blessing and curse</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.519" end="00:24:03.149" style="s2">that I&#39;m I I doubt everything that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.460" end="00:24:04.859" style="s2">think or do all the time and yet that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.149" end="00:24:08.070" style="s2">sort of what we have to do I think to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.859" end="00:24:10.109" style="s2">step back from you know I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.070" end="00:24:11.759" style="s2">here to convince people that I&#39;m right</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.109" end="00:24:13.710" style="s2">because we actually don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.759" end="00:24:15.899" style="s2">answers to a lot of these questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.710" end="00:24:19.019" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a really big question</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.899" end="00:24:21.379" style="s2">here a friend of mine and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.019" end="00:24:24.239" style="s2">someone you know as well peter lindbergh</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.379" end="00:24:25.590" style="s2">who wrote a really interesting piece</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.239" end="00:24:26.909" style="s2">about culture war too</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.590" end="00:24:30.210" style="s2">in tow where he talked about the need</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.909" end="00:24:33.029" style="s2">for mimetic mediation which i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.210" end="00:24:35.400" style="s2">really great concept the idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.029" end="00:24:38.460" style="s2">sort of splitting off into mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.400" end="00:24:40.409" style="s2">tribes and that what&#39;s required is</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.460" end="00:24:43.049" style="s2">mediation between the tribes that for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.409" end="00:24:45.179" style="s2">feels like a really important concept to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.049" end="00:24:46.590" style="s2">enter the the discourse at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.179" end="00:24:48.450" style="s2">yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.590" end="00:24:51.029" style="s2">and I love that article that was written</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.450" end="00:24:52.409" style="s2">in the document and I already even go</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.029" end="00:24:55.260" style="s2">further so that we need people that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.409" end="00:24:57.659" style="s2">tribe less you know in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.260" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">like we have we we acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.659" end="00:25:00.179" style="s2">there are people out there that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:01.529" style="s2">more privileged than others and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.179" end="00:25:03.539" style="s2">that the people that do have more</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.529" end="00:25:04.260" style="s2">privilege that are willing to they want</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.539" end="00:25:06.179" style="s2">to put it to good use</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.260" end="00:25:08.909" style="s2">could be the tribal of people that go</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.179" end="00:25:12.090" style="s2">around and try to hang out with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.909" end="00:25:14.100" style="s2">tribes that you know most of their sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.090" end="00:25:15.630" style="s2">of culture has not gotten along with to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.100" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">understand them to also be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.630" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">representative of sanity of the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:22.620" style="s2">side I think it works both ways to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:24.149" style="s2">know but it&#39;s it&#39;s a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.620" end="00:25:26.220" style="s2">effort and so it&#39;s not an obligation for</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.149" end="00:25:28.399" style="s2">us to do but there is this opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.220" end="00:25:30.809" style="s2">for people to travel between and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.399" end="00:25:34.110" style="s2">hopefully not get exiled from all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.809" end="00:25:35.490" style="s2">them as a result and I&#39;d love to hear a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.110" end="00:25:37.220" style="s2">little bit I&#39;ll ask you a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.490" end="00:25:39.240" style="s2">questions about your particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.220" end="00:25:41.610" style="s2">political journey because you talked a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.240" end="00:25:43.169" style="s2">bit in the book about the Trump election</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.610" end="00:25:45.809" style="s2">and some arguments that were had around</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.169" end="00:25:47.490" style="s2">that and we&#39;ve taught just before we</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.809" end="00:25:50.850" style="s2">came on air about that that you feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.490" end="00:25:54.330" style="s2">that you this is partly related to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.850" end="00:25:56.130" style="s2">writing the book can you tell me a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.330" end="00:25:58.890" style="s2">about kind of how your views have maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.130" end="00:26:00.870" style="s2">changed or you&#39;ve tried to kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.890" end="00:26:05.880" style="s2">more of a different perspectives into</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.870" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">your worldview yeah I would put myself I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.880" end="00:26:10.919" style="s2">think I took one of those tribe tests</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:14.130" style="s2">and I got the you know far left</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.919" end="00:26:16.710" style="s2">progressive liberal designation that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.130" end="00:26:20.220" style="s2">know is is sort of unpopular right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.710" end="00:26:21.870" style="s2">amongst some people so I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.220" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">my background and that was that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.870" end="00:26:25.500" style="s2">continues to be my background I see a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:28.529" style="s2">lot of the the good that comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.500" end="00:26:30.929" style="s2">that sort of line of thinking what</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.529" end="00:26:33.960" style="s2">changed for me was this realization that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.929" end="00:26:35.130" style="s2">I was completely blind to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.960" end="00:26:36.780" style="s2">things that were happening a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.130" end="00:26:37.710" style="s2">things people were thinking because I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.780" end="00:26:39.630" style="s2">had my own</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.710" end="00:26:41.400" style="s2">you know worldview that I was filtering</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.630" end="00:26:43.170" style="s2">everything through and this came through</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.400" end="00:26:44.730" style="s2">like just having you know a long</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.170" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">conversation with a couple friends and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.730" end="00:26:47.850" style="s2">realizing that we&#39;ve known each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:50.220" style="s2">for twenty years and we can&#39;t connect</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.850" end="00:26:51.510" style="s2">and that was heartbreaking and if I</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.220" end="00:26:53.340" style="s2">can&#39;t connect with the people I know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.510" end="00:26:54.840" style="s2">best how am I ever gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.340" end="00:26:57.240" style="s2">conversation with a stranger or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.840" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">co-worker or you know somebody else that</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.240" end="00:27:02.040" style="s2">disagrees with me so I had to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:03.630" style="s2">sit back and think you know I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.040" end="00:27:06.390" style="s2">something wrong what am I doing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.630" end="00:27:07.850" style="s2">and you know that means having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.390" end="00:27:11.820" style="s2">these conversations and being willing to</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.850" end="00:27:14.190" style="s2">examine hard things that I tended to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.820" end="00:27:15.780" style="s2">believe by default and and being willing</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.190" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">to not necessarily change my mind but</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.780" end="00:27:19.470" style="s2">expand my belief to include other</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:21.080" style="s2">possibilities as well the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.470" end="00:27:24.780" style="s2">with those two friends was that a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.080" end="00:27:27.150" style="s2">political disagreement or it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.780" end="00:27:29.790" style="s2">definitely the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.150" end="00:27:32.400" style="s2">conservative versus liberal argument you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.790" end="00:27:35.370" style="s2">know my friends are religious and have</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.400" end="00:27:37.350" style="s2">you know they live in you know texas or</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.370" end="00:27:40.380" style="s2">Florida or often or the Middle East and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.350" end="00:27:41.700" style="s2">often give me this perspective like oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.380" end="00:27:43.890" style="s2">yeah this is how the other side is</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.700" end="00:27:45.270" style="s2">seeing what&#39;s happening I&#39;m interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.890" end="00:27:47.790" style="s2">it this way and they&#39;re interpreting it</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.270" end="00:27:49.140" style="s2">completely differently and yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.790" end="00:27:50.910" style="s2">it was definitely just a political</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.140" end="00:27:53.040" style="s2">disagreement at the time but it does go</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.910" end="00:27:55.830" style="s2">much deeper than that in terms of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.040" end="00:27:57.480" style="s2">know values and of like you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.830" end="00:27:59.610" style="s2">more important taking care of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.480" end="00:28:02.730" style="s2">or having freedom and independence and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.610" end="00:28:04.500" style="s2">and so those those are the the big you</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.730" end="00:28:06.750" style="s2">know disagreements that we&#39;re having as</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.500" end="00:28:09.270" style="s2">a culture and I saw it reflected in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.750" end="00:28:13.590" style="s2">friendships and you must be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.270" end="00:28:16.440" style="s2">Jonathan Heights work I imagine and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">he talks about would you agree with his</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.440" end="00:28:20.190" style="s2">framing that many of our political</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:22.530" style="s2">beliefs are actually temperamental so</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.190" end="00:28:25.470" style="s2">that a lot of the time we were arguing</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.530" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">with when we&#39;re arguing about political</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.470" end="00:28:29.480" style="s2">things we&#39;re arguing with different</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:33.360" style="s2">temperamental types rather than</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.480" end="00:28:36.210" style="s2">fact-based or things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.360" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">reasoned through yeah that was hugely</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.210" end="00:28:41.010" style="s2">influential in my book because I it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.660" style="s2">the first time I realized that hey</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.010" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">there&#39;s several moral spectrum&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.660" end="00:28:46.620" style="s2">judge something on and we don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:48.750" style="s2">about them we talk about good and bad we</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.620" end="00:28:49.670" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about you know freedom versus</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.670" end="00:28:55.340" style="s2">slavery nor harm versus care or disgust</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.220" end="00:29:01.910" style="s2">know once you see that and you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.440" end="00:29:06.980" style="s2">that all my arguments are about evidence</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.910" end="00:29:09.530" style="s2">and yet all of this is about values we</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.980" end="00:29:10.730" style="s2">are arguing over here about this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.530" end="00:29:12.740" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s not working we have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.730" end="00:29:14.420" style="s2">first move into the what I call like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.740" end="00:29:15.890" style="s2">the realm of the heart right Bethel</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.420" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">talked about our values of our what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.890" end="00:29:20.420" style="s2">care about what we prefer in order to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:22.429" style="s2">then connect and then we can move on to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.420" end="00:29:23.900" style="s2">what I call the realm of the hands like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.429" end="00:29:26.270" style="s2">doing something and seeing what works</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.900" end="00:29:27.559" style="s2">and seeing how how it unfolds and just</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.270" end="00:29:30.679" style="s2">leave the evidence behind because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.559" end="00:29:32.809" style="s2">not going to actually you know solve</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.679" end="00:29:33.950" style="s2">anyone&#39;s question in the moment because</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.809" end="00:29:35.090" style="s2">they were actually carrying about</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.950" end="00:29:37.220" style="s2">something completely different than you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.090" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">first we&#39;re talking about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.220" end="00:29:40.820" style="s2">dialogue across divisions and I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:45.320" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been very involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.820" end="00:29:47.210" style="s2">the letter platform which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.320" end="00:29:49.240" style="s2">new social media site designed for</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.210" end="00:29:51.710" style="s2">long-form conversation across divides</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.240" end="00:29:53.000" style="s2">however you have you found that what</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.710" end="00:29:56.510" style="s2">kind of conversations are you having</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.000" end="00:29:58.309" style="s2">their great ones are so great I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.510" end="00:29:59.900" style="s2">it&#39;s just the ability to have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.309" end="00:30:01.400" style="s2">long-form conversation with people you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.900" end="00:30:02.630" style="s2">disagree with you know where else can</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.400" end="00:30:05.299" style="s2">you do that I mean you can technically</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.630" end="00:30:07.640" style="s2">do it on your blog but you can do it on</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.299" end="00:30:10.419" style="s2">podcast and stuff like that but for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.640" end="00:30:13.700" style="s2">most part we don&#39;t have a way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.419" end="00:30:16.100" style="s2">just as people and in using Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.700" end="00:30:17.780" style="s2">Facebook so I my first conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.100" end="00:30:19.820" style="s2">there was with a fellow named BJ</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.780" end="00:30:22.100" style="s2">Campbell who was a gun rights advocate</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.820" end="00:30:23.690" style="s2">and had published some really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.100" end="00:30:26.270" style="s2">articles and medium that were thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.690" end="00:30:28.850" style="s2">too data-driven evidence and we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.270" end="00:30:30.440" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about this on letter and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.850" end="00:30:33.140" style="s2">had a fantastic conversation about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.440" end="00:30:35.059" style="s2">where our goal was to agree on some kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.140" end="00:30:39.650" style="s2">of policy proposal that we both felt</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.059" end="00:30:42.260" style="s2">would have an impact on gun violence gun</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.650" end="00:30:44.150" style="s2">death in the long term and after</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.260" end="00:30:46.490" style="s2">something like 14 thousand words we got</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.150" end="00:30:48.410" style="s2">there which is you know it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.490" end="00:30:50.120" style="s2">words but it&#39;s also we got somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.410" end="00:30:51.320" style="s2">that we&#39;ve never gotten before and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.120" end="00:30:53.020" style="s2">think we have to be willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.320" end="00:30:54.890" style="s2">patient to have those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.020" end="00:30:56.150" style="s2">individually before we can have them as</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.890" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">groups before we can have them as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.150" end="00:31:00.980" style="s2">country or you know as a world so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:03.380" style="s2">great place to start I was straw reading</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.980" end="00:31:07.160" style="s2">your book you reference the work of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.380" end="00:31:10.220" style="s2">in D&#39;Angelo and white fragility my</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.160" end="00:31:12.590" style="s2">understanding of her work and is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.220" end="00:31:15.770" style="s2">she talked about white fragility and she</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.590" end="00:31:19.790" style="s2">talks about how white fragility you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.770" end="00:31:22.250" style="s2">display white fragility by did</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.790" end="00:31:24.940" style="s2">essentially disagreeing with her or</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.250" end="00:31:26.840" style="s2">being silent or leaving the room or</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.940" end="00:31:28.790" style="s2">bursting into tears</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.840" end="00:31:30.380" style="s2">pretty much what I understand pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.790" end="00:31:32.930" style="s2">much everything apart from agreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.380" end="00:31:34.520" style="s2">her you demonstrate white fragility</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.930" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">which a lot of people have described as</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.520" end="00:31:40.160" style="s2">a casket wrap and so I&#39;m that that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:42.140" style="s2">be an area that would be the one point</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.160" end="00:31:44.810" style="s2">in the book where I was thinking I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.140" end="00:31:48.170" style="s2">sure yet that there was sort of a few</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.810" end="00:31:49.250" style="s2">red flags came up yeah that&#39;s it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.170" end="00:31:52.220" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting to explore</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.250" end="00:31:53.870" style="s2">because I&#39;ve read the book and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.220" end="00:31:55.580" style="s2">get those impressions at all I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.870" end="00:31:57.940" style="s2">listened to her talks and workshops and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.580" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">stuff and I&#39;m a big fan of what she says</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.940" end="00:32:02.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the step that I would encourage</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:04.190" style="s2">us to do is like let&#39;s let&#39;s confirm</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.540" end="00:32:06.740" style="s2">whether or not our belief about what</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.190" end="00:32:08.570" style="s2">she&#39;s claiming is true but you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.740" end="00:32:11.510" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s does she claim to speak for</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.570" end="00:32:13.250" style="s2">white people does she claim to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.510" end="00:32:14.750" style="s2">have all the answers and tell people why</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.250" end="00:32:18.070" style="s2">they&#39;re ron and know better than we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.750" end="00:32:20.270" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing wrong I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.070" end="00:32:22.130" style="s2">continue and those facts are about</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.270" end="00:32:24.800" style="s2">asking her I guess or reading her book</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.130" end="00:32:26.630" style="s2">and I think there is a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.800" end="00:32:28.600" style="s2">the same way that like someone like</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.630" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">James d&#39;amour has been you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.600" end="00:32:34.550" style="s2">demonized by the left and you know Robin</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">has been demonized by the that group you</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.550" end="00:32:38.840" style="s2">know the I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:40.490" style="s2">called but yeah so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.840" end="00:32:43.070" style="s2">there&#39;s the there&#39;s a projection of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.490" end="00:32:46.460" style="s2">something and that if that was true I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.070" end="00:32:48.470" style="s2">would not necessarily try to defend it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.460" end="00:32:50.570" style="s2">but there&#39;s also the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.470" end="00:32:52.550" style="s2">we&#39;re misrepresenting her and her work</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.570" end="00:32:54.350" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s definitely the case I</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.550" end="00:32:57.710" style="s2">I encourage people to read the book</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.350" end="00:32:58.220" style="s2">before thinking that they know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.710" end="00:33:00.440" style="s2">she&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.220" end="00:33:02.780" style="s2">because this is a nuanced thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.440" end="00:33:04.700" style="s2">hard to understand and it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.780" end="00:33:06.620" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to mischaracterize</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.700" end="00:33:07.970" style="s2">which is stuff that we should be having</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.620" end="00:33:10.550" style="s2">conversations about that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.970" end="00:33:12.230" style="s2">and putting up gates and saying that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.550" end="00:33:15.320" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it wrong is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.230" end="00:33:16.920" style="s2">productive yeah and I&#39;d like to - open</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.320" end="00:33:18.660" style="s2">it out and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.920" end="00:33:20.550" style="s2">it would be great to see her in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.660" end="00:33:24.090" style="s2">with someone maybe on the letter</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.550" end="00:33:27.150" style="s2">platform or on this channel or or</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.090" end="00:33:28.530" style="s2">wherever so maybe let&#39;s let&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.150" end="00:33:29.940" style="s2">put some feelers out and see whether</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.530" end="00:33:32.100" style="s2">that might be possible with someone who</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.940" end="00:33:34.650" style="s2">is critical of her work and those a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.100" end="00:33:37.740" style="s2">more about it than I do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.650" end="00:33:40.680" style="s2">I&#39;d be great I would love that so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.740" end="00:33:42.450" style="s2">my last question is there&#39;s one very</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.680" end="00:33:43.830" style="s2">practical tip that I really liked that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.450" end="00:33:47.070" style="s2">you talked about in the book and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.830" end="00:33:49.140" style="s2">to eat together which I thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.070" end="00:33:50.610" style="s2">really like it makes perfect sense if</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.140" end="00:33:52.890" style="s2">we&#39;re sharing food with someone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.610" end="00:33:55.620" style="s2">probably tapping into some very</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.890" end="00:33:58.740" style="s2">deep-rooted patterns of safety and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.620" end="00:33:59.790" style="s2">community that and that that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.740" end="00:34:01.680" style="s2">if you need to have a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.790" end="00:34:03.630" style="s2">conversation maybe do it over dinner is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.680" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">that is that something that that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.630" end="00:34:08.400" style="s2">would advise absolutely it might seem</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:09.630" style="s2">trite but you know I think we there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.400" end="00:34:12.179" style="s2">several reasons where I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.630" end="00:34:14.790" style="s2">good number one food you know is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.179" end="00:34:16.830" style="s2">calming sort of satiating chemical that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.790" end="00:34:18.630" style="s2">can sort of prevent our blood pressure</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.830" end="00:34:21.950" style="s2">from spiking suddenly and our heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.630" end="00:34:24.210" style="s2">from jumping out and turning us into</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.950" end="00:34:26.610" style="s2">sort of in the moving us through the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.210" end="00:34:28.380" style="s2">attack mode to the person has to be in</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.610" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">the room with you you know oftentimes we</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.380" end="00:34:31.710" style="s2">think we&#39;re arguing with someone or a</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:33.810" style="s2">group of people that a group of people</p>
