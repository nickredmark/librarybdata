<p begin="00:02:08.200" end="00:02:12.630" style="s2">is one of just sort of exploration an</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.209" end="00:02:14.430" style="s2">understanding and of curiosity and</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:28.050" style="s2">mindset was originally sort of just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">an underground sensation I think it came</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.050" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">out earlier last year and it&#39;s just sold</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:36.300" style="s2">tons of cops that copies it was at one</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">point in the top 150 overall not just in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">one section but overall on the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:41.610" style="s2">website and I believe they sell</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:43.830" style="s2">something like 8 million books there so</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.610" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a pretty impressive feat</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.830" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">and now the book has made it into</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">conservative think-tanks and mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:53.730" style="s2">media and there&#39;s been a series of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:56.460" style="s2">articles that have come out notably</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.730" end="00:02:58.860" style="s2">in Politico and from the Claremont</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.460" end="00:03:00.660" style="s2">Institute where Michael Anton gave it a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.860" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">very thorough review almost 5000 words</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.660" end="00:03:05.880" style="s2">from what I understand and it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:08.850" style="s2">brought the book and these ideas closer</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.880" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">and closer into the mainstream and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.850" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">know mr. bap I&#39;ll just call a bap if you</p>

<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">so what how did it feel and what do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.750" end="00:03:29.370" style="s2">think about the sudden interest from</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:31.220" style="s2">mainstream media and from conservative</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.370" end="00:03:34.740" style="s2">think-tanks what does that mean to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.220" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">well on one hand is very nice because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.740" end="00:03:43.140" style="s2">want my message to get vital exposure</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:45.660" style="s2">any author does and I was very Mike</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.140" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">Anton gave it such a thorough review as</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.660" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">you say on the other hand I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:53.550" style="s2">he agreed very much with me but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:55.950" style="s2">fine he gave me a fair review and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.550" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">intend to respond to him in the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.950" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">thing as for the other piece are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:04.440" style="s2">political piece that is a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:07.140" style="s2">matter and if we have a minute I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.440" end="00:04:09.080" style="s2">like to talk about this forum for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.140" end="00:04:12.300" style="s2">moment the political piece was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.080" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">concerning it was a hit piece on me okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.300" end="00:04:18.540" style="s2">yeah and tell us what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:22.470" style="s2">well quite aside from the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.540" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">connected me implicitly to shooters and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.470" end="00:04:26.590" style="s2">to violence which is just absurd for</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:29.389" style="s2">anyone who knows anything about</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.590" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">quite the sight from that lie there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.389" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">a much more sinister in significant lies</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.530" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">that was spread the media attacks on me</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:42.440" style="s2">they try to oppress me in coordination</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:44.630" style="s2">with probably with political strategists</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.440" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">and if you have a few minutes I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.630" end="00:04:50.360" style="s2">call out their dirty little game now</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.830" style="s2">then we can talk about details in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.360" end="00:04:54.530" style="s2">book but I think people need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.830" end="00:04:57.169" style="s2">understand what is going on why they are</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.770" end="00:12:31.690" style="s2">it&#39;s much closer to something like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.140" end="00:12:33.780" style="s2">then to any political manifesto it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.690" end="00:12:37.210" style="s2">just absurd to try to make me into this</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.780" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">and by the way since this connects to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.210" end="00:12:43.330" style="s2">what you just said about the way you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:45.430" style="s2">promote in self-improvement for men and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.330" end="00:12:48.040" style="s2">why these people are so threatened by</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.430" end="00:12:50.380" style="s2">that I&#39;m not saying that I just wrote</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.040" end="00:12:52.570" style="s2">some kind of artsy book out of a desire</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.380" end="00:12:55.510" style="s2">to pretend I&#39;m harmless</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.570" end="00:12:57.520" style="s2">my book is not harmful in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.510" end="00:12:59.830" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t teach violence I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.520" end="00:13:02.110" style="s2">and quite the opposite and so on but it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.830" end="00:13:04.870" style="s2">is very damaging to the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.110" end="00:13:06.940" style="s2">it&#39;s damaging to the so-called elite and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.870" end="00:13:09.580" style="s2">to their agenda and the pretensions I</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.940" end="00:13:12.460" style="s2">think what you do what rush darts what</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.580" end="00:13:15.370" style="s2">these other people do on the Internet is</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.460" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">the same is it shows to these people</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.370" end="00:13:20.950" style="s2">that they have no more say really</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">with the use they are not the future so</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.950" end="00:13:25.330" style="s2">of course they try to smear us the only</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.530" end="00:13:28.060" style="s2">way they know how by tying us to</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.330" end="00:13:31.720" style="s2">violence sort of whatever pretending</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.060" end="00:13:34.810" style="s2">that I&#39;m some kind of foreign guy trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.720" end="00:13:37.420" style="s2">to corrupt the military that I got into</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.810" end="00:13:40.390" style="s2">you that&#39;s what they will go with next</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.420" end="00:13:43.380" style="s2">right I&#39;m gonna jump ahead a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.390" end="00:13:45.790" style="s2">here but I mentioned that the book was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.380" end="00:13:47.350" style="s2">taking shots at her critique of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.790" end="00:13:49.660" style="s2">establishment and the elites and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.350" end="00:13:52.780" style="s2">makes them afraid one of the questions I</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.660" end="00:13:55.300" style="s2">was gonna ask you later is of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.780" end="00:13:58.690" style="s2">establishment itself at whom did you</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.300" end="00:14:01.510" style="s2">take aim because I think Mike Anton</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.690" end="00:14:04.870" style="s2">Michael Anton his reaction to me was</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.510" end="00:14:07.240" style="s2">like this guy bronze-age pervert is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.870" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">talking to the audience that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.240" end="00:14:13.270" style="s2">establishment conservatives want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:15.520" style="s2">address and he&#39;s doing a better job than</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.270" end="00:14:18.930" style="s2">we are and for that purpose we should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.520" end="00:14:22.630" style="s2">afraid so it seems to me that your book</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.930" end="00:14:24.310" style="s2">is probably can be can be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.630" end="00:14:27.160" style="s2">discarded by people on the left because</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.310" end="00:14:29.290" style="s2">they already hate us but for people on</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.160" end="00:14:31.210" style="s2">the right I think that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:33.460" style="s2">sort of terrifying because you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.210" end="00:14:34.900" style="s2">opened up a conduit to the next</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.460" end="00:14:36.850" style="s2">generation and that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.900" end="00:14:40.150" style="s2">they have unable been unable to do so</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.850" end="00:14:42.310" style="s2">far and for that reason you may also be</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.150" end="00:14:43.960" style="s2">subjected to attacks from people on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.310" end="00:14:47.830" style="s2">right as well what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.960" end="00:14:50.680" style="s2">that oh I have no doubt and in fact many</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.830" end="00:14:54.820" style="s2">people so-called on the right are are</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.680" end="00:14:57.940" style="s2">bad people they they will attack they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.820" end="00:15:00.340" style="s2">come out with all guns against Trump in</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.940" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">2020 not by the way that I&#39;m a big Trump</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.340" end="00:15:04.930" style="s2">booster but just be aware that many</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">people so-called on the right Russ doubt</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.930" end="00:15:10.840" style="s2">that other people like that at New York</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:14.410" style="s2">Times and elsewhere they&#39;re hardly</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.840" end="00:15:16.540" style="s2">really on the right but how to answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.410" end="00:15:20.470" style="s2">your thing look the people on the left</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.540" end="00:15:23.050" style="s2">and the right hate me because I talk to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.470" end="00:15:25.830" style="s2">young people outside of their knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.050" end="00:15:29.380" style="s2">and outside of their surveillance and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.830" end="00:15:30.760" style="s2">what they need to understand is they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.380" end="00:15:33.490" style="s2">try to talks me</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.760" end="00:15:36.699" style="s2">isolate me destroy me I&#39;m guessing they</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.490" end="00:15:39.550" style="s2">will try all of these things they try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.699" end="00:15:42.010" style="s2">identify me as a representative of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.550" end="00:15:44.260" style="s2">online youth movement so that then they</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.010" end="00:15:48.190" style="s2">can destroy me and they think therefore</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.260" end="00:15:50.050" style="s2">also this whole 4chan youth movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.190" end="00:15:52.690" style="s2">that&#39;s been going on online they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.050" end="00:15:54.850" style="s2">understand and I want to also tell you</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.690" end="00:15:57.250" style="s2">this I think you do understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.850" end="00:15:59.980" style="s2">going on online is much bigger than me</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.250" end="00:16:02.050" style="s2">it&#39;s much bigger than bronze-age pervert</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.980" end="00:16:04.420" style="s2">or Bronze Age mindset I didn&#39;t invent it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.050" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">and the conditions that led to it will</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.420" end="00:16:11.079" style="s2">exist with or without me it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:14.380" style="s2">movement of young people who communicate</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.079" end="00:16:17.320" style="s2">with each other with images with jokes</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.380" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2">with a highly specialized form of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.320" end="00:16:22.269" style="s2">knowledge that the whole establishment</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.750" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">had no access to whatsoever they missed</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.269" end="00:16:26.910" style="s2">it entirely and there are guys who came</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:29.170" style="s2">on in two thousand fifteen or fourteen</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.910" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">and they were fifteen or sixteen years</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.170" end="00:16:35.410" style="s2">old so half of the teenage years they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:37.630" style="s2">lived in this in this world okay which</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.410" end="00:16:39.250" style="s2">has spread well you say the left doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.630" end="00:16:41.740" style="s2">care they do care it&#39;s spread well</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.250" end="00:16:44.170" style="s2">beyond the so-called right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.740" end="00:16:46.269" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to say it spread among in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.170" end="00:16:49.000" style="s2">pop culture of the youth at large</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.269" end="00:16:50.410" style="s2">except outside the eyes and control of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.000" end="00:16:53.260" style="s2">the establishment that&#39;s why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.410" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">panicking and my book is only just the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.260" end="00:16:58.300" style="s2">tip of the iceberg of that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:17:02.319" style="s2">it&#39;s just the one thing that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.300" end="00:17:04.150" style="s2">that that made it to national media</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.319" end="00:17:06.280" style="s2">maybe the first but there are other</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.150" end="00:17:08.110" style="s2">things that will come out and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.280" end="00:17:11.410" style="s2">missing this entirely and that panicking</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.110" end="00:17:14.500" style="s2">they have no access to this entire huge</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.410" end="00:17:16.270" style="s2">segment of the youth who are good kids</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.500" end="00:17:19.270" style="s2">you know they go to school they have</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.270" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">good jobs etc they then it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.270" end="00:17:23.559" style="s2">to try to smear them the way they these</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">people try so they try to smear me</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.559" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">instead right well there are kids coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:31.270" style="s2">up and coming of age politically</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">speaking who have only ever heard from</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.270" end="00:17:37.980" style="s2">their leads and elders that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">white says straight men are the root of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.980" end="00:17:42.330" style="s2">all evil and so there&#39;s I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.470" end="00:17:45.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a growing dissatisfaction with</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.330" end="00:17:47.790" style="s2">that that sort of label and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.960" end="00:17:49.890" style="s2">there&#39;s no way any self-respecting</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.790" end="00:17:52.200" style="s2">individual male like that can can</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.890" end="00:17:54.540" style="s2">support or be involved in a process that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.200" end="00:17:57.030" style="s2">sees them or their fathers or their</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.540" end="00:17:58.470" style="s2">grandfathers or their legacy as being</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.030" end="00:17:59.460" style="s2">the source of all of the problems and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.470" end="00:18:02.370" style="s2">something that needs to be eradicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.460" end="00:18:04.560" style="s2">and while those kids may not understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.370" end="00:18:06.600" style="s2">what critical theory is or what actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.560" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">social justice or intersectionality is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.600" end="00:18:10.590" style="s2">you know all that has really worked its</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:12.780" style="s2">way into all of our media and narratives</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.590" end="00:18:14.430" style="s2">universities everything and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.780" end="00:18:16.890" style="s2">sufficient enough for the leftist</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.430" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">philosophers and and ideologues to just</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.890" end="00:18:21.570" style="s2">discuss things it&#39;s built into their</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">ideology to destroy and dismantle things</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.570" end="00:18:27.300" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s their explicit Express</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:28.560" style="s2">stated goal and the morality code is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.300" end="00:18:30.180" style="s2">based around intersectionality which</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.560" end="00:18:32.280" style="s2">just has which has the white male at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.180" end="00:18:33.570" style="s2">middle of it now personally I</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.280" end="00:18:35.550" style="s2">hate talking about all these issues</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.570" end="00:18:37.410" style="s2">about race and gender and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.550" end="00:18:40.110" style="s2">because I was raised to not think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.410" end="00:18:43.080" style="s2">that stuff I was I&#39;m Gen X I&#39;m 43</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.110" end="00:18:45.180" style="s2">I was raised don&#39;t think about race</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.080" end="00:18:47.130" style="s2">don&#39;t think about gender judge everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.180" end="00:18:48.600" style="s2">by their merits and let&#39;s just be happy</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.130" end="00:18:49.470" style="s2">you know I was like okay that seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.600" end="00:18:52.590" style="s2">reasonable to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.470" end="00:18:54.150" style="s2">and now all that has sort of been turned</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.590" end="00:18:56.610" style="s2">on its head and people are coming up are</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.150" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">not going to really want to stick with</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.610" end="00:19:01.350" style="s2">that now this brings me what you said</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:04.920" style="s2">brings me to a question that I have for</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.350" end="00:19:07.020" style="s2">you and you mentioned that it was you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.920" end="00:19:10.050" style="s2">used the language and ideas and imagery</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.020" end="00:19:13.020" style="s2">of sort of the very on line a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.050" end="00:19:14.940" style="s2">underground changi community and I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.020" end="00:19:17.370" style="s2">fortunate in some respects that I I got</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.940" end="00:19:19.650" style="s2">online big time like around 2007 so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.370" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">and I and I connected with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.650" end="00:19:23.880" style="s2">these people so I have seen this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:26.340" style="s2">evolve over you know more than a decade</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.880" end="00:19:30.020" style="s2">now and as I was reading the book I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.340" end="00:19:30.020" style="s2">struck by sort of thinking it was like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.380" end="00:19:35.340" style="s2">it was like urging people to do things</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.480" end="00:19:36.690" style="s2">and describing the circumstances but at</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.340" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">the same time it was sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.690" end="00:19:40.980" style="s2">surfacing and underground to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.660" style="s2">mainstream if that&#39;s if that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.980" end="00:19:44.310" style="s2">possible with the self-published book</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.660" end="00:19:46.590" style="s2">but it seemed to me it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.310" end="00:19:47.309" style="s2">collection of of all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.590" end="00:19:48.929" style="s2">I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.309" end="00:19:52.049" style="s2">thinking and people have been talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.929" end="00:19:55.830" style="s2">about overtime was there any intent that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.049" end="00:19:57.419" style="s2">you had to sort of memorialize what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.830" end="00:19:58.710" style="s2">had discovered and the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.419" end="00:20:00.179" style="s2">had talked you know the people you would</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.710" end="00:20:02.999" style="s2">talk to and the things that you&#39;d read</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.179" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">and your own ideas and contextualize it</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.999" end="00:20:08.190" style="s2">and in that in that community and bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:10.049" style="s2">it forth or was the book just all coming</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.190" end="00:20:11.519" style="s2">straight off the top of your head and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.049" end="00:20:15.269" style="s2">the way that you&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.519" end="00:20:17.370" style="s2">things for many years now yes more much</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.269" end="00:20:20.369" style="s2">more the second thing you say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.370" end="00:20:23.429" style="s2">because my intended audience was really</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.369" end="00:20:28.919" style="s2">this youth generation that you talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.429" end="00:20:31.499" style="s2">about who and not the mainstream I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.919" end="00:20:34.649" style="s2">no desire whatsoever to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.499" end="00:20:36.659" style="s2">mainstream I wrote the book we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.649" end="00:20:41.429" style="s2">later if you want but I wrote the book</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.659" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">for that audience principally and I like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.429" end="00:20:46.619" style="s2">you I&#39;ve been online since around</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:50.309" style="s2">exactly that time and maybe you also but</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.619" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">I think I don&#39;t think I take too much</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.309" end="00:20:54.990" style="s2">credit I&#39;ve been in part the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.200" end="00:20:56.610" style="s2">some of the means people use and have</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.990" end="00:20:58.529" style="s2">been using for a while so I&#39;ve been part</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.610" end="00:21:01.409" style="s2">of it for a long time no I that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.529" end="00:21:05.009" style="s2">how we communicate with each other right</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.409" end="00:21:07.379" style="s2">and I saw you finally I have to it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.009" end="00:21:09.869" style="s2">just about white youth I I must</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.379" end="00:21:12.419" style="s2">emphasize that it&#39;s yes it&#39;s much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.869" end="00:21:15.990" style="s2">the the there&#39;s a joke running around</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.419" end="00:21:18.119" style="s2">that this dissident right is is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.990" end="00:21:19.499" style="s2">non-white and there&#39;s I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.119" end="00:21:21.659" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s a lot of truth to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.499" end="00:21:24.809" style="s2">that people would be very surprised to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.659" end="00:21:27.240" style="s2">learn yeah I would agree with that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.809" end="00:21:29.549" style="s2">and again me personally I&#39;m uninterested</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.240" end="00:21:32.700" style="s2">in race and ethnic specific</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.549" end="00:21:34.919" style="s2">conversations and such like that the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.700" end="00:21:37.590" style="s2">gen-x are in me sort of route best you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.919" end="00:21:39.240" style="s2">know takes a takes a sour look at things</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.590" end="00:21:40.619" style="s2">like that but you mentioned that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.240" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re writing specifically for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.619" end="00:21:44.970" style="s2">youth movement so what what do you say</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:48.360" style="s2">to someone who doesn&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.970" end="00:21:51.539" style="s2">about you who may not know anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.360" end="00:21:55.139" style="s2">about rhetoric or satire or hyperbole in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.539" end="00:21:57.330" style="s2">literature what what do you tell them</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.139" end="00:21:59.340" style="s2">about your book how do you tell them to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.330" end="00:22:00.840" style="s2">approach it and what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.340" end="00:22:03.659" style="s2">happens to someone who picks up</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.840" end="00:22:07.820" style="s2">your book and reads it who isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.659" end="00:22:10.440" style="s2">steeped in rhetoric doesn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.820" end="00:22:14.070" style="s2">sort of the big picture and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.440" end="00:22:16.500" style="s2">techniques involved yes I imagine they</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.070" end="00:22:18.419" style="s2">might misunderstand but the book to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.500" end="00:22:20.669" style="s2">ignore me which is what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.419" end="00:22:23.850" style="s2">about that&#39;s the name for normal person</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.669" end="00:22:26.659" style="s2">let&#39;s say mainstream person right that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.850" end="00:22:31.260" style="s2">kind of person I think unless they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.659" end="00:22:33.090" style="s2">malicious or demented would realize for</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.260" end="00:22:34.860" style="s2">them it&#39;s a humor book I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.090" end="00:22:37.590" style="s2">things in it that are so absurd to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.860" end="00:22:40.289" style="s2">ignore me right so my hope is that such</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.590" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">a person with maybe chocolate it and put</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.289" end="00:22:46.140" style="s2">it down is aside from that or even that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:49.020" style="s2">I really don&#39;t care what they think I</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.140" end="00:22:51.510" style="s2">didn&#39;t write the book for them who did</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.020" end="00:22:54.029" style="s2">write for normies but let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.510" end="00:22:56.700" style="s2">just like a college freshman who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.029" end="00:22:58.860" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t know that like American</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.700" end="00:23:00.840" style="s2">politics has been steeped with rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.860" end="00:23:02.220" style="s2">I mean I remember reading about like an</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.840" end="00:23:03.929" style="s2">election around the turn of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.220" end="00:23:05.789" style="s2">century where the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.929" end="00:23:08.100" style="s2">candidates in the newspapers that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.789" end="00:23:09.720" style="s2">owned themselves mind you we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.100" end="00:23:12.090" style="s2">writing about the other guys saying if</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.720" end="00:23:14.399" style="s2">so-and-so wins there&#39;s gonna be open for</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.090" end="00:23:16.850" style="s2">negation streets and like I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.399" end="00:23:19.320" style="s2">like crazy stuff like end of time stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.850" end="00:23:21.419" style="s2">it&#39;s so like there&#39;s a tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.320" end="00:23:23.549" style="s2">rhetoric and hyperbole in American</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.419" end="00:23:26.279" style="s2">politics but when you&#39;re 18 you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.549" end="00:23:29.159" style="s2">know that and and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.279" end="00:23:32.270" style="s2">are some some passages in the book that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.159" end="00:23:35.309" style="s2">I think if people read quite literally</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.270" end="00:23:36.690" style="s2">you know could lead them maybe to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.309" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">different outcome that perhaps you had</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.690" end="00:23:41.190" style="s2">intended well you&#39;d have to tell me what</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:44.250" style="s2">you have in mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.190" end="00:23:48.090" style="s2">but I can tell you I have very big</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.250" end="00:23:50.940" style="s2">audience in Scandinavia the first review</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.090" end="00:23:53.309" style="s2">of my book was in Swedish and since then</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.940" end="00:23:56.039" style="s2">it&#39;s been circulated widely in</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.309" end="00:23:58.830" style="s2">Scandinavia I&#39;ve huge sales the huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.039" end="00:24:01.649" style="s2">sales in Japan so my book is not really</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.830" end="00:24:04.590" style="s2">yes it&#39;s not specific to American</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.649" end="00:24:07.950" style="s2">political culture or even just to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.590" end="00:24:11.280" style="s2">lingo of this internet world I think I</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.950" end="00:24:12.929" style="s2">try to go beyond that to talk to someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.280" end="00:24:14.119" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t know anything at all about</p>

<p begin="00:24:14.119" end="00:24:20.509" style="s2">hence the many references to books from</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.059" end="00:24:31.969" style="s2">the ideas in the book so I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.929" end="00:24:34.579" style="s2">go beyond just the say small corner of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.969" end="00:24:36.259" style="s2">the internet but I should emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.579" end="00:24:38.829" style="s2">attraction of this corner of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.259" end="00:24:41.959" style="s2">Internet is that we are not completely</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.970" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">know I tweeted and wrote a lot different</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.059" end="00:27:54.350" style="s2">when I only thought like 50 people we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.090" end="00:28:00.260" style="s2">could possibly read every tweet and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.309" end="00:28:03.080" style="s2">sometimes even millions of people can</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:06.470" style="s2">see a tweet thousands of people read my</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.080" end="00:28:08.990" style="s2">book like I have in my my own sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.470" end="00:28:11.149" style="s2">what I call platform responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.990" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">right like I would never write some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.149" end="00:28:16.669" style="s2">the things I wrote when I was first</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:21.649" style="s2">starting anonymous for fun as a joke etc</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.669" end="00:28:24.380" style="s2">yes as I would now do you feel like if</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.649" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">you had the same platform size when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.380" end="00:28:28.610" style="s2">wrote the book as you do now and will</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.580" style="s2">seemingly have in the future even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.610" end="00:28:35.029" style="s2">would you write the book the same way</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.580" end="00:28:37.220" style="s2">how will you handle power your power</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.029" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">growing and the unintended consequences</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.370" end="00:28:45.310" style="s2">I think I would write the book the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.070" end="00:28:47.390" style="s2">way I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.310" end="00:28:49.910" style="s2">irresponsible in the book and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.390" end="00:28:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a very wholesome message the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.910" end="00:28:53.990" style="s2">practical advice I give if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.400" end="00:28:58.130" style="s2">something not like that you should tell</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.990" end="00:29:01.340" style="s2">me what you have in mind but no I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.130" end="00:29:03.590" style="s2">I think I would do the same well you</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.340" end="00:29:06.460" style="s2">have you asked me and so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.590" end="00:29:07.610" style="s2">have to ask a couple questions so</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.460" end="00:29:09.320" style="s2">wholesome</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.610" end="00:29:12.710" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that wholesome is the word</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.320" end="00:29:17.000" style="s2">that I would use to describe it indeed</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.710" end="00:29:20.150" style="s2">some of the few concrete example call to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.000" end="00:29:23.330" style="s2">action items in the book are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.150" end="00:29:25.190" style="s2">wholesome and benign but for example go</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.330" end="00:29:26.780" style="s2">to the gym worship the Sun and steel</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.190" end="00:29:28.220" style="s2">which I love that&#39;s a wonderful phrase</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.780" end="00:29:30.050" style="s2">that&#39;s something I&#39;ve been writing about</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.220" end="00:29:31.880" style="s2">anyone that knows anything about</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.420" end="00:29:54.860" style="s2">how to adapt to this new technology that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.730" end="00:29:56.780" style="s2">we have Jordan Hall who&#39;s been on my</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.300" end="00:30:10.790" style="s2">see that that&#39;s that&#39;s great advice and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.090" end="00:30:13.390" style="s2">then also you give them advice to form</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.790" end="00:30:16.160" style="s2">very tight male friendships fraternity</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.390" end="00:30:18.140" style="s2">societies and orders and and I you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.160" end="00:30:20.060" style="s2">obviously I take that very seriously as</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.140" end="00:30:22.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve already created and done something</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.060" end="00:30:24.530" style="s2">in that very exact particular vein which</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.730" end="00:30:26.660" style="s2">is to create a fraternity of men who</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.530" end="00:30:28.790" style="s2">seek to support each other and want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.660" end="00:30:31.430" style="s2">prepare themselves to be the best people</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.790" end="00:30:34.220" style="s2">that they can be and if something crazy</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.430" end="00:30:36.140" style="s2">happens down the line be prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.220" end="00:30:37.700" style="s2">take appropriate action and buy action</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.140" end="00:30:39.140" style="s2">that can mean protect your family I</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.140" end="00:30:44.060" style="s2">prepared and aware so that to me is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.930" end="00:30:47.480" style="s2">the wholesome part there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.060" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">the the rhetorical flourishes let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.480" end="00:30:51.890" style="s2">or sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.750" style="s2">and and this is gonna dovetail with</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.890" end="00:30:56.180" style="s2">another question I want to ask but sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.750" end="00:30:59.240" style="s2">of like predictions for the future and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.180" end="00:31:01.010" style="s2">or slash requests for the future I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.240" end="00:31:03.320" style="s2">know like for example there&#39;s a passage</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.010" end="00:31:05.060" style="s2">where you say that in the future either</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.320" end="00:31:07.520" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember is it there will be or</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.220" end="00:31:31.270" style="s2">inevitability is it desirable you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.130" end="00:31:34.820" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about that well</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.270" end="00:31:38.180" style="s2">remember I also say I think somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.820" end="00:31:40.340" style="s2">that zoo animals from the zoos should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.180" end="00:31:43.670" style="s2">open and that animals from the zoos</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.340" end="00:31:45.710" style="s2">should run free in the city you know and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.670" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">I think I know but I as I&#39;m reading that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.710" end="00:31:50.690" style="s2">similarly that&#39;s a met that&#39;s a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:52.520" style="s2">for unleashing the Beast Within upon the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.690" end="00:31:57.380" style="s2">world I mean is it not or was that just</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.520" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">a throwaway it&#39;s it&#39;s a joke we&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.060" end="00:32:37.400" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously a lot of stuff in it</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.920" end="00:32:39.050" style="s2">like that now as for the specific</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.400" end="00:32:41.240" style="s2">question you asked about the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.050" end="00:32:44.660" style="s2">that&#39;s not a call to action</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.240" end="00:32:47.060" style="s2">many people have let&#39;s say predicted the</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.790" end="00:32:54.470" style="s2">not a call to action it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.710" end="00:32:56.570" style="s2">observations about political life across</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.470" end="00:32:58.820" style="s2">the world and it&#39;s entirely possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.570" end="00:33:00.470" style="s2">that at some point in the future who</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.820" end="00:33:02.420" style="s2">knows when it could be a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.470" end="00:33:05.060" style="s2">that&#39;s not the call to action</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.420" end="00:33:07.340" style="s2">but right right I mean and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.060" end="00:33:09.170" style="s2">part and parcel to like fourth</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.340" end="00:33:11.240" style="s2">generation warfare to where the lines</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:19.820" style="s2">different kinds of levels whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.380" end="00:33:21.320" style="s2">mental moral spiritual or physical you</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.820" end="00:33:23.810" style="s2">know those things are evolving so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.320" end="00:33:25.280" style="s2">know it is a it is an observation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.810" end="00:33:28.370" style="s2">something that may come in the future</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.280" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">and and this is exactly why I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.370" end="00:33:32.240" style="s2">have this conversation is because I</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:34.550" style="s2">tried to read the book as if I were</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.240" end="00:33:38.330" style="s2">someone that didn&#39;t know anything that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.550" end="00:33:41.300" style="s2">know right and when I read you say that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.330" end="00:33:44.390" style="s2">women&#39;s freedom is an infection a fatal</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.300" end="00:33:46.660" style="s2">infection upon the West it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.390" end="00:33:51.020" style="s2">makes it makes me laugh right because</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.660" end="00:33:55.040" style="s2">it&#39;s funny but you know to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.020" end="00:33:56.660" style="s2">who&#39;s not who doesn&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.040" end="00:33:59.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper more nuanced argument</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.660" end="00:34:03.560" style="s2">within there they&#39;re going to read that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.000" end="00:34:05.420" style="s2">and just be terrorized right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.560" end="00:34:08.240" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s your way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.420" end="00:34:11.780" style="s2">feminist overreach I guess is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.240" end="00:34:13.400" style="s2">what I&#39;m understanding and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.780" end="00:34:15.170" style="s2">think that there are probably people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.400" end="00:34:17.600" style="s2">will hear me ask these questions hear</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.170" end="00:34:19.970" style="s2">your answers and hear you say it&#39;s humor</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.600" end="00:34:22.220" style="s2">and these are jokes and whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.970" end="00:34:24.260" style="s2">then they&#39;ll still be like nah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.220" end="00:34:26.060" style="s2">still just a secret code to turn</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.260" end="00:34:28.460" style="s2">everybody into pirates running around</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.060" end="00:34:34.400" style="s2">the world you know just taking what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.460" end="00:34:37.940" style="s2">want right right right</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.400" end="00:34:40.910" style="s2">which is right so again again this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.940" end="00:34:43.460" style="s2">exactly why this is exactly why I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.910" end="00:34:45.920" style="s2">to have this conversation and and before</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.460" end="00:34:47.600" style="s2">I move on from sort of like this meta</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.920" end="00:34:50.510" style="s2">part and the structure and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.600" end="00:34:52.160" style="s2">did you you said you&#39;ve been very online</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.510" end="00:34:54.530" style="s2">since around the time I have did you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.160" end="00:34:57.860" style="s2">hang out around any of those old blogs</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.530" end="00:34:59.660" style="s2">like Roissy or the old roof place did</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.880" end="00:35:07.580" style="s2">sort of felt like echoing Jack Donovan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:11.060" style="s2">way of men and certainly there were</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.580" end="00:35:15.000" style="s2">terms and ideas and memes and turns of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.060" end="00:35:17.190" style="s2">phrase that reminded me of very specific</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.000" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">that commenters back on those old boards</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.190" end="00:35:23.340" style="s2">I told you about that I am I was like no</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.770" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">copy one phrase from a commenter on</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:20.100" style="s2">Rosie&#39;s blog but I don&#39;t think this year</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:23.340" style="s2">of interest to broader audience and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.100" end="00:36:25.860" style="s2">that&#39;s not me and I just thought it he</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.340" end="00:36:29.340" style="s2">had a funny turn of phrase in one you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.860" end="00:36:32.670" style="s2">know a but hexed okay I like that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.340" end="00:36:34.910" style="s2">this the example you just gave of how it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.670" end="00:36:36.810" style="s2">could my rhetoric you say could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.910" end="00:36:40.860" style="s2">misinterpreted other thing about women</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.810" end="00:36:43.950" style="s2">because okay so you&#39;re right I do say</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.860" end="00:36:46.710" style="s2">that giving the franchise to women the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.950" end="00:36:51.090" style="s2">voting franchise was the biggest self</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.710" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">owned that Western civilization any</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.090" end="00:36:55.980" style="s2">civilization has ever done okay and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:59.150" style="s2">stand by that as a historical</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.100" end="00:37:19.320" style="s2">as I argue in the book and elsewhere it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.620" end="00:37:22.410" style="s2">is an impossibility what you do when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.320" end="00:37:26.580" style="s2">free women to vote and not just women</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.410" end="00:37:28.049" style="s2">but when you put universal democracy the</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.929" end="00:37:50.849" style="s2">wrongness of that but insofar as call to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.719" end="00:37:53.819" style="s2">action remember in the book I follow</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.849" end="00:37:57.779" style="s2">this up by saying and you should never</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.709" end="00:38:43.589" style="s2">just the beginning he&#39;s not okay so so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.319" end="00:38:47.009" style="s2">I can try to mix in the book what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.589" end="00:38:49.140" style="s2">would call extreme states statements of</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.789" end="00:39:16.739" style="s2">I had much smaller account then and yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.939" end="00:39:20.459" style="s2">when you are obscured and you lack power</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.739" end="00:39:24.119" style="s2">your fears to tell the truth right part</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.459" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">of um on a meta level I thought that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.119" end="00:39:31.229" style="s2">book was a demonstration in freedom</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">right it was a demonstration and I can</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.390" end="00:39:42.210" style="s2">and this is sort of a way</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.400" end="00:42:15.210" style="s2">then other just sort of normal things</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.930" end="00:42:17.450" style="s2">that any reasonable person should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.210" end="00:42:20.060" style="s2">able to discuss like the merits of</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.060" end="00:42:25.020" style="s2">undocumented immigration on like things</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.470" end="00:42:32.010" style="s2">up myself in such a way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.120" end="00:42:33.840" style="s2">anticipating maybe that would happen and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.010" end="00:42:36.360" style="s2">I have been able to turn a doxxing into</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.840" end="00:42:38.130" style="s2">a positive and to use it to you know</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.900" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">the same thing in fact I have absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.270" end="00:42:50.310" style="s2">no doubt that you have thought about</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:52.310" style="s2">that quite a bit yes yes they need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.310" end="00:42:54.870" style="s2">understand I&#39;m not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.310" end="00:42:59.820" style="s2">some people disappeared unfortunately</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.820" end="00:43:03.600" style="s2">important to understand why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.530" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">doing this they believe by isolating me</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.600" end="00:43:09.480" style="s2">or isolating you that they can put cat</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:12.300" style="s2">back in the bag when it comes to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.480" end="00:43:14.730" style="s2">youth movement it&#39;s not going anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.300" end="00:43:17.370" style="s2">and when you mentioned earlier about why</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.730" end="00:43:20.790" style="s2">they would take interest in you and us</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.370" end="00:43:24.990" style="s2">who built our own audiences over time it</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.790" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">just shows how artificial before all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.990" end="00:43:30.570" style="s2">this popular culture has been in America</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:34.230" style="s2">probably in the world as a whole they</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.570" end="00:43:36.390" style="s2">pick a young guy out of Los Angeles or</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.230" end="00:43:39.570" style="s2">some other place Miami and they raise</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.390" end="00:43:41.490" style="s2">him to be a singer and everything is</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.570" end="00:43:43.950" style="s2">public relations he&#39;s completely and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.490" end="00:43:46.080" style="s2">through raising up such people they</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.950" end="00:43:48.630" style="s2">entirely hope to modulate popular</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.080" end="00:43:51.420" style="s2">culture and the minds of young people</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.630" end="00:43:54.330" style="s2">and we have been talking to the young</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.420" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">entirely outside of that okay and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.330" end="00:43:58.950" style="s2">can get rid of us you know but they</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:00.930" style="s2">can&#39;t get rid of this and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.950" end="00:44:03.210" style="s2">white youth this needs to be emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.930" end="00:44:05.940" style="s2">the entire sections of the youth not</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.210" end="00:44:07.500" style="s2">even just on the right are dissatisfied</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.940" end="00:44:09.990" style="s2">and they&#39;ve been communicating with each</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.500" end="00:44:12.150" style="s2">other online outside the view of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.990" end="00:44:15.300" style="s2">authorities and establishment and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.150" end="00:44:16.500" style="s2">going to continue no matter what yes no</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.300" end="00:44:20.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s only going to actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.500" end="00:44:21.869" style="s2">proliferate and you know for folks like</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.040" end="00:44:23.970" style="s2">me and the members of the liminal order</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.869" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve got over a hundred guys now seven</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.970" end="00:44:30.119" style="s2">countries around the world three</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">different continents our goal is to sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.119" end="00:44:36.030" style="s2">of get out of the spotlight get off of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:39.720" style="s2">social media out of the glare and to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.030" end="00:44:42.119" style="s2">sort of go back underground and put down</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.720" end="00:44:45.720" style="s2">dark root or deep roots rather and in</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.119" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">fact part of my inspiration for doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.720" end="00:44:50.550" style="s2">that with luminal order was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:53.640" style="s2">Curtis sharp and he suggests he</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.550" end="00:44:56.849" style="s2">suggested that exact thing which is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.640" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">is to stop engaging with the Predators</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.849" end="00:45:02.190" style="s2">on the savanna and to actually sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:03.390" style="s2">become a little bit more quiet and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.190" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">little bit more judicious with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.390" end="00:45:08.130" style="s2">things that you do and you say and to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:11.579" style="s2">sort of allow things to have time to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.130" end="00:45:14.790" style="s2">grow and to evolve and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.579" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">online the kids the young people you</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.790" end="00:45:19.410" style="s2">know we don&#39;t mean children here we mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:21.420" style="s2">you know like 18 24 somewhere in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.410" end="00:45:26.280" style="s2">range they&#39;re definitely taking their</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.420" end="00:45:29.130" style="s2">conversations out of their learning to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.280" end="00:45:30.300" style="s2">up front about it because it&#39;s gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.130" end="00:45:32.339" style="s2">you in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.300" end="00:45:36.270" style="s2">and so those conversations are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.339" end="00:45:38.220" style="s2">still happening I wanted to just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.270" end="00:45:39.690" style="s2">now get into some of the meat and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.220" end="00:45:41.670" style="s2">concepts in the book because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.690" end="00:45:44.099" style="s2">much fascinating stuff in here and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.670" end="00:45:46.079" style="s2">gotta say reading it reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.099" end="00:45:48.210" style="s2">reading Camille Paglia</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.079" end="00:45:49.740" style="s2">in that like every sentence and</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.210" end="00:45:52.710" style="s2">assertion you made was backed up by</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.740" end="00:45:54.900" style="s2">historical references to antiquity and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.710" end="00:45:57.089" style="s2">the classics and stuff which I found to</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.900" end="00:45:59.099" style="s2">be very impressive and very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.089" end="00:46:01.079" style="s2">there&#39;s by no means any way that I could</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.099" end="00:46:03.000" style="s2">fact check or confirm everything that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.079" end="00:46:04.740" style="s2">you said in there but I&#39;m of the things</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.000" end="00:46:07.609" style="s2">I did know about you seem to get them</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.740" end="00:46:10.680" style="s2">right and so I&#39;m gonna trust that but</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.609" end="00:46:12.569" style="s2">the book contents is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.680" end="00:46:13.650" style="s2">also really want to talk about here and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.569" end="00:46:16.829" style="s2">one of the main things I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.650" end="00:46:17.970" style="s2">about is this idea of space and claiming</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.829" end="00:46:20.460" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.970" end="00:46:22.110" style="s2">is there you know can you give us a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.460" end="00:46:25.380" style="s2">little summary on that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.110" end="00:46:27.180" style="s2">primary theme within within the whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.380" end="00:46:29.010" style="s2">book and it&#39;s something that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.180" end="00:46:34.680" style="s2">dig into about dig into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.010" end="00:46:37.980" style="s2">with you yes I think I can sum it up in</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.680" end="00:46:42.650" style="s2">one quote that I I think Carl Schmitt he</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.980" end="00:46:45.630" style="s2">said they&#39;ve put us out to pasture</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.650" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">regarding the fate of Europe after World</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.630" end="00:46:51.660" style="s2">War two when it was reduced to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:55.170" style="s2">province and entirely dependent and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.660" end="00:46:57.780" style="s2">think this experience of essentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.170" end="00:46:59.670" style="s2">being put in I don&#39;t want to say mental</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.780" end="00:47:03.720" style="s2">asylum but something like that and in</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.670" end="00:47:06.510" style="s2">closed own space is something that many</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.720" end="00:47:08.790" style="s2">young people grow up today feeling very</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.510" end="00:47:12.270" style="s2">dissatisfied with this lack of ability</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.790" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">to explore so forth so I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.270" end="00:47:20.070" style="s2">about this feeling in context of biology</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:23.790" style="s2">in general and meaning of life in</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.070" end="00:47:26.610" style="s2">general like meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.790" end="00:47:29.900" style="s2">biologically I mean yeah I see I see so</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.610" end="00:47:33.150" style="s2">what what is constraining young people</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.900" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">in in their space who&#39;s putting them in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.150" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">their space how is the this space you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:41.400" style="s2">talking about already preoccupied what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:44.600" style="s2">occupying it I would like to just free</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.400" end="00:47:48.030" style="s2">to expand on that a little bit please</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.600" end="00:47:52.260" style="s2">yes I must say I think before we start</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.030" end="00:47:55.020" style="s2">the talk I I told you in regards of</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.260" end="00:47:58.320" style="s2">particular ideas or passages of the book</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.020" end="00:48:01.260" style="s2">I would prefer not to elaborate too much</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.320" end="00:48:04.920" style="s2">detail because I put them this way in</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.260" end="00:48:08.040" style="s2">the book for for the reason the book was</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.920" end="00:48:11.130" style="s2">something I&#39;ve thought about for perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.040" end="00:48:13.410" style="s2">10 years or longer and I expressed</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.130" end="00:48:16.280" style="s2">things in it in a very condensed way for</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.410" end="00:48:20.040" style="s2">the reason while writing some passages I</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.280" end="00:48:22.230" style="s2">found myself going for many pages with</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.040" end="00:48:25.380" style="s2">explanations and arguments the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.230" end="00:48:27.630" style="s2">people normally would and and I stopped</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.380" end="00:48:31.050" style="s2">myself and I limited myself to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.630" end="00:48:34.340" style="s2">expressing the main idea as I skipped</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.050" end="00:48:36.990" style="s2">many steps of reasoning on purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.340" end="00:48:41.420" style="s2">so for this reason I don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.990" end="00:48:44.600" style="s2">too much into detailed elaboration of</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.420" end="00:48:46.380" style="s2">passages so I think the book speaks</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.600" end="00:48:49.230" style="s2">speaks for itself</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.380" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">but I can tell you regarding what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.230" end="00:48:55.560" style="s2">asking now in the book I say we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:58.830" style="s2">know who the owners of this space are</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.560" end="00:49:01.920" style="s2">and I meant that and I will leave it at</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.830" end="00:49:04.350" style="s2">that but the feeling that your</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.920" end="00:49:08.790" style="s2">possibilities for action are entirely</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.350" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">constrained is undeniably there and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.790" end="00:49:13.260" style="s2">not just there in the first world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:15.000" style="s2">much more pronounced people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.260" end="00:49:21.450" style="s2">realize this if you go to a third-world</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.000" end="00:49:24.030" style="s2">slum it&#39;s it&#39;s much more it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.450" end="00:49:26.190" style="s2">much more advanced this is feeling right</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.030" end="00:49:28.650" style="s2">a sort of a sort of a lack of choice a</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.190" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">lack of freedom I guess this was just</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.650" end="00:49:31.950" style="s2">one step in a series of questions I</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:34.080" style="s2">wanted to go through which was you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.950" end="00:49:36.690" style="s2">trying to find a frontier like where</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.080" end="00:49:39.840" style="s2">where is it right now where people can</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.690" end="00:49:41.820" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re exploring where is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.840" end="00:49:44.430" style="s2">that they feel like they can get that</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.820" end="00:49:46.020" style="s2">sort of vitality that you described from</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.430" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">seeking out new adventures and new</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.020" end="00:49:53.730" style="s2">places and unknown things and weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:56.430" style="s2">and underworld like well I think you yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.730" end="00:49:57.750" style="s2">I think that isn&#39;t is yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.430" end="00:50:01.590" style="s2">that&#39;s the point I think it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.750" end="00:50:05.130" style="s2">completely squashed down tamp down</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.590" end="00:50:08.220" style="s2">throughout the 20th century with much</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.130" end="00:50:11.700" style="s2">more so after the cold war started but</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.220" end="00:50:13.980" style="s2">you said one word there at the end and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.700" end="00:50:15.660" style="s2">it&#39;s the last section of my book and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.980" end="00:50:18.120" style="s2">I&#39;ll just put it at that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.660" end="00:50:19.230" style="s2">frontier it&#39;s just not what people think</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.120" end="00:50:22.460" style="s2">it is mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.230" end="00:50:25.020" style="s2">because the way this world is controlled</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.460" end="00:50:27.240" style="s2">you asked who the owners of this space</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.020" end="00:50:30.630" style="s2">are the owners of this space are the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.240" end="00:50:32.670" style="s2">people who just assassinated epstein in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.630" end="00:50:35.310" style="s2">front of the public knowing there would</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.670" end="00:50:36.990" style="s2">be no consequences for them they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.310" end="00:50:39.210" style="s2">stronger than the president they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.990" end="00:50:41.670" style="s2">stronger than the Department of Justice</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.210" end="00:50:43.650" style="s2">you don&#39;t know who they are they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.670" end="00:50:47.100" style="s2">care and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.650" end="00:50:51.360" style="s2">is the frontier except a normal person</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.100" end="00:50:54.150" style="s2">has no access to it the Epstein I like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.360" end="00:50:56.760" style="s2">call it an assassination the apparent</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.150" end="00:50:59.550" style="s2">suicide of Jeffrey Epstein just kidding</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.760" end="00:51:02.280" style="s2">he that should have been there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.550" end="00:51:04.770" style="s2">massive and I used this term loosely now</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.280" end="00:51:08.220" style="s2">red pilling sort of revealing moment for</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.770" end="00:51:10.710" style="s2">the entire nation that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.220" end="00:51:13.050" style="s2">forces out there that seemingly can just</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.710" end="00:51:14.360" style="s2">murder the guy we all knew the guy was</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.050" end="00:51:16.680" style="s2">gonna get killed</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.360" end="00:51:18.570" style="s2">yeah and then they did it right in front</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.680" end="00:51:22.200" style="s2">of our faces and they&#39;re gonna get away</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.570" end="00:51:24.990" style="s2">with it it if that didn&#39;t just stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.200" end="00:51:27.210" style="s2">everybody in their tracks like nothing</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.990" end="00:51:30.180" style="s2">really is gonna I don&#39;t think it seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.210" end="00:51:32.820" style="s2">to me that we&#39;ve sort of accepted that</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.180" end="00:51:35.640" style="s2">would you agree that we&#39;ve accepted the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.820" end="00:51:39.000" style="s2">presence of of people that can operate</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.640" end="00:51:42.120" style="s2">with impunity and and commit murders and</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.000" end="00:51:45.030" style="s2">steal billions of dollars and start wars</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.120" end="00:51:48.930" style="s2">and I mean have we just accepted that as</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.030" end="00:51:51.420" style="s2">our fate I&#39;m afraid so I&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.930" end="00:51:55.350" style="s2">everything they say about Russia that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.420" end="00:51:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s run by spooks who bribe and extort</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.350" end="00:52:00.210" style="s2">people with compromise and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.840" end="00:52:03.270" style="s2">thing is how America and in fact all</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.210" end="00:52:05.610" style="s2">modern states run except here it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.270" end="00:52:08.570" style="s2">more occulted by this whole language of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.610" end="00:52:13.110" style="s2">democracy and rights and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.570" end="00:52:16.140" style="s2">people have been hypnotized many too</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.110" end="00:52:18.600" style="s2">into buying that language but more and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.140" end="00:52:20.790" style="s2">more that they&#39;re seeing the way the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.600" end="00:52:23.040" style="s2">cake is baked right to sorry to use</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.790" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">cliche but they saw it with the Podesta</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.040" end="00:52:29.220" style="s2">emails yes you know it&#39;s so obvious but</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:30.990" style="s2">I am a bit black pale or pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.220" end="00:52:34.140" style="s2">about this I have an older friend who</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.990" end="00:52:38.370" style="s2">says Kennedy when he was killed everyone</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.140" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">no one believed the the government story</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.370" end="00:52:43.820" style="s2">the single so I interfere oh yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.520" end="00:52:46.530" style="s2">mean it&#39;s come to be believed because</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.820" end="00:52:48.510" style="s2">it&#39;s the historical narrative that got</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.530" end="00:52:51.270" style="s2">put in books but apparently at the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.510" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">no one believed the story they all</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.270" end="00:52:56.010" style="s2">thought the CIA did it or whoever some</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:56.410" style="s2">some secrets agency we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.010" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.410" end="00:53:04.299" style="s2">and but did that change anything no I</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:09.009" style="s2">think so you ask who owns the space and</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.299" end="00:53:12.039" style="s2">I I can only begin to to think that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.009" end="00:53:15.009" style="s2">is who right well one of the frontiers</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.039" end="00:53:17.079" style="s2">that I saw and I see in my life and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.009" end="00:53:20.470" style="s2">I seek out is one that&#39;s inside my own</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.079" end="00:53:23.019" style="s2">head I&#39;m finding through meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.470" end="00:53:25.480" style="s2">the time that I take to become present</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.019" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">inside my own thoughts or even table to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.480" end="00:53:28.450" style="s2">discard them</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:30.369" style="s2">that there&#39;s like a whole frontier</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.450" end="00:53:31.980" style="s2">inside of my brain that I had no idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.369" end="00:53:35.890" style="s2">was even there</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.980" end="00:53:37.599" style="s2">and I recommend guys to take ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.890" end="00:53:39.369" style="s2">every day to try to meditate and to try</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.599" end="00:53:41.559" style="s2">to calm themselves and to try to explore</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.369" end="00:53:44.109" style="s2">that space because truly that is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.559" end="00:53:47.259" style="s2">one of the only places where you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.109" end="00:53:49.720" style="s2">actually find freedom and and liberation</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.290" end="00:55:42.230" style="s2">because it allows them to increase their</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.230" end="00:55:46.240" style="s2">I say you fight them you have to fight</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.790" end="00:55:49.250" style="s2">them spiritually you have to engage them</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.240" end="00:55:52.910" style="s2">the way I tried with the book with some</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.250" end="00:55:55.010" style="s2">is that with media with videos with as</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.910" end="00:55:57.080" style="s2">most of all with mockery</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.010" end="00:55:59.180" style="s2">it&#39;s what absolutely kills them is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.080" end="00:56:01.160" style="s2">mockery yeah they can&#39;t stand being</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.180" end="00:56:04.550" style="s2">mocked you know that so they come after</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.160" end="00:56:06.310" style="s2">me and people who mock them right in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.550" end="00:56:08.390" style="s2">fact that&#39;s one of the things that I</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.980" end="00:57:10.670" style="s2">mock people it does sort of denude them</p>

<p begin="00:58:08.779" end="00:58:16.999" style="s2">you know but I you look at someone like</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.319" end="00:58:19.279" style="s2">Nietzsche who I keep mentioning in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.999" end="00:58:22.579" style="s2">book there are many people middlebrow</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.279" end="00:58:25.430" style="s2">people who read him and they say oh this</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.579" end="00:58:28.460" style="s2">is all rhetoric it&#39;s already see they</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.430" end="00:58:31.279" style="s2">are the ones who can&#39;t get beyond his</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.460" end="00:58:33.349" style="s2">rhetoric but Nietzsche isn&#39;t interested</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.279" end="00:58:37.640" style="s2">in talking to the middle brow he talks</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.349" end="00:58:40.160" style="s2">to to audiences he wants to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.640" end="00:58:44.049" style="s2">people on one hand and perhaps artists</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.160" end="00:58:47.059" style="s2">and others who would make art literature</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.059" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">hand he&#39;s in dialogue with great</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:59.630" style="s2">okay and he doesn&#39;t care about the other</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.069" end="00:59:01.819" style="s2">audiences and this is lost this is lost</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.630" end="00:59:04.579" style="s2">on many people when when those are your</p>

<p begin="01:04:28.370" end="01:04:31.970" style="s2">really stood out to me and there seem to</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.290" end="01:04:34.040" style="s2">be a lot of emphasis on feelings</p>

<p begin="01:05:22.700" end="01:05:28.850" style="s2">ultimately that or even travel today I</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.810" end="01:05:30.800" style="s2">was talking with some people about this</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.850" end="01:05:34.700" style="s2">movie the beach you know the movie the</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.050" end="01:06:01.020" style="s2">will only really be able to escape that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.300" end="01:06:04.130" style="s2">feeling if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.020" end="01:06:08.220" style="s2">managed to attain actual sovereignty of</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.930" end="01:06:18.900" style="s2">and that can be achieved primarily I</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.530" end="01:06:21.660" style="s2">think in the fight against what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.900" end="01:06:23.970" style="s2">called wealth I&#39;m copying Hobbs right</p>

<p begin="01:07:06.270" end="01:07:11.869" style="s2">I mean it the same way in the book the</p>

<p begin="01:08:29.830" end="01:08:33.910" style="s2">struck by the conformist nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.049" end="01:08:38.020" style="s2">dissident art that they had up I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.910" end="01:08:40.779" style="s2">it&#39;s all in the same veins of what I</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.020" end="01:08:42.870" style="s2">believe Garvin would call the cathedral</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.779" end="01:08:45.460" style="s2">what Jordan Hall called the blue church</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.870" end="01:08:48.279" style="s2">and all that contained therein</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.460" end="01:08:51.009" style="s2">it&#39;s all just sort of art echoing all</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.279" end="01:08:54.279" style="s2">that stuff and it&#39;s not dissident it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.009" end="01:08:56.170" style="s2">not subversive in any way when was the</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.279" end="01:08:59.109" style="s2">last time like a dissident or subversive</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.170" end="01:09:01.000" style="s2">movie came out or even music I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.109" end="01:09:03.100" style="s2">there&#39;s not is there even such a thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.000" end="01:09:06.040" style="s2">as punk rock anymore maybe I&#39;m just old</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.100" end="01:09:09.310" style="s2">you know they&#39;ve completely co-opted it</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.040" end="01:09:11.739" style="s2">okay Rage Against the Machine is now the</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.310" end="01:09:14.319" style="s2">machine I mean I&#39;ve seen them talk and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.739" end="01:09:16.540" style="s2">and they and they they toe the new party</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.319" end="01:09:19.150" style="s2">line and such and so I think that your</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.540" end="01:09:21.160" style="s2">book in particular is a great example of</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.150" end="01:09:24.670" style="s2">the possibility of dissident or</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.160" end="01:09:26.230" style="s2">subversive art because it is important</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.670" end="01:09:29.009" style="s2">to take to read the book with that</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.230" end="01:09:32.620" style="s2">perspective rather than like a literal</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.009" end="01:09:35.170" style="s2">handbook they&#39;re freaked out by anyone</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.620" end="01:09:37.480" style="s2">who is not owned that freaked out by you</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.170" end="01:09:39.250" style="s2">yes they&#39;re freaked out by certain of</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.480" end="01:09:41.380" style="s2">which that freaked out by Rush and by</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.250" end="01:09:44.170" style="s2">many others whose names are not yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.380" end="01:09:46.299" style="s2">known from our corner of the internet</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.170" end="01:09:49.350" style="s2">like manequa known for and other</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.299" end="01:09:51.880" style="s2">incredibly talented people who I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.350" end="01:09:54.310" style="s2">deserve attention and who actually do</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.880" end="01:09:56.920" style="s2">have a very large audience among the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.310" end="01:09:59.350" style="s2">youth but they&#39;re freaked out by people</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.920" end="01:10:02.020" style="s2">who have a message that is an own look</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.350" end="01:10:03.670" style="s2">at how they react to PewDiePie right I</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.020" end="01:10:05.560" style="s2">mean he&#39;s the biggest one of all right</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.670" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">but but he&#39;s so big they can&#39;t stop he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.560" end="01:10:10.900" style="s2">got 100 million you know me they can</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:12.969" style="s2">start they can they can try to stop or</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.900" end="01:10:14.980" style="s2">some became they can&#39;t but look at how</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.969" end="01:10:16.960" style="s2">they freak out over him so when I say</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.980" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">cultural warfare he&#39;s having a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.960" end="01:10:22.090" style="s2">fun right he&#39;s not explicitly political</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:23.739" style="s2">I think I mean things like that people</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.090" end="01:10:26.860" style="s2">can do things like that right I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.739" end="01:10:27.650" style="s2">right and I think also people can create</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.860" end="01:10:29.540" style="s2">new Association</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.650" end="01:10:31.219" style="s2">and create new friendships and new</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.540" end="01:10:32.360" style="s2">communities and such and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.219" end="01:10:34.699" style="s2">that&#39;s something that you really</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.360" end="01:10:35.989" style="s2">emphasize especially in the air towards</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.699" end="01:10:38.600" style="s2">the end there were some quotes that I</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.989" end="01:10:40.940" style="s2">like man they really hit home to me like</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.600" end="01:10:42.530" style="s2">especially this one the friendships you</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.940" end="01:10:44.390" style="s2">have made meeting each other in person</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.530" end="01:10:45.830" style="s2">or online are the greatest event to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.390" end="01:10:49.040" style="s2">last few years and source for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.830" end="01:10:51.530" style="s2">greatest promise I can&#39;t tell you how</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.040" end="01:10:54.980" style="s2">much I agree with that sentiment it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.530" end="01:10:56.989" style="s2">an absolute miracle the people that I</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.980" end="01:10:59.900" style="s2">have become connected to the way that</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.989" end="01:11:01.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to congregate both</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.900" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">online and in person because doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.640" end="01:11:08.360" style="s2">things in person now are is an essential</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:11.719" style="s2">next step the ability that we&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.360" end="01:11:14.780" style="s2">come together around ideas and not just</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.719" end="01:11:16.550" style="s2">come together around a job or a location</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.780" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">where I live or a school that I went to</p>

<p begin="01:12:18.080" end="01:12:21.409" style="s2">the last issues is I want to dig into</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.580" end="01:12:24.800" style="s2">before we just sort of come to a wrap</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.409" end="01:12:29.210" style="s2">here was your sort of discussion about</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.800" end="01:12:32.750" style="s2">are so many things sir the masculinity</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.210" end="01:12:34.340" style="s2">purity of purpose is manliness manliness</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.750" end="01:12:37.250" style="s2">is the first requirement of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.340" end="01:12:38.579" style="s2">philosopher these ideas and the mention</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.250" end="01:12:40.469" style="s2">of masculinity</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.579" end="01:12:43.860" style="s2">to be seemed like to indicate that it</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.469" end="01:12:46.590" style="s2">was really important to you do you think</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.860" end="01:12:50.070" style="s2">that masculinity is specifically under</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.590" end="01:12:52.710" style="s2">attack today who owns the masculine</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.070" end="01:12:56.040" style="s2">space right now and I don&#39;t mean like</p>

<p begin="01:13:11.969" end="01:13:16.409" style="s2">mood benefits the psychological benefits</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.670" end="01:13:19.949" style="s2">aside from the physical ones</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.409" end="01:13:22.559" style="s2">but aside from that I think just what</p>

<p begin="01:21:56.680" end="01:22:01.390" style="s2">expect even right they will run McMaster</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.830" end="01:22:03.010" style="s2">or something for as a spoilered</p>

<p begin="01:22:12.970" end="01:22:16.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter but what he basically</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.200" end="01:22:18.580" style="s2">said is like he said that there was a</p>
