<p begin="00:00:09.540" end="00:00:15.059" style="s2">fear that the that men checking out</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.420" end="00:00:17.400" style="s2">could be a fatal situation for Western</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.059" end="00:00:19.350" style="s2">culture gods definitely fatal for</p>

<p begin="00:00:19.350" end="00:00:24.570" style="s2">struck me over the last year all even</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">last night at the lecture at last</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">night&#39;s lecture 85% of the people were</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:32.579" style="s2">men now in the twelve part series that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">preceded that more and more women came</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.579" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">and then there was this gap but like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.579" style="s2">vast majority of the audience was men</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">and men of all sorts like it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.579" end="00:00:44.570" style="s2">you&#39;re like every sort of man was</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">York City or I drove from Michigan it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:00.020" style="s2">like well you could watch it on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like no they&#39;re not doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.020" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">that&#39;s very promising to me because well</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">this logos that the West will die</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">without the rebirth of the logos because</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">the West is that so</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">there&#39;s fascism</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">there&#39;s communism and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:28.740" style="s2">New Age mess because it&#39;s a mess and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">most of its wish fulfillment and fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">and inability to there&#39;s creativity in</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">it but there&#39;s no capacity to edit</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">there&#39;s no coherence and so that&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:43.409" style="s2">so weak that anyone with any commitment</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">can just push it aside and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.409" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">justification for the for the Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">and or for the fascism it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">already had that experiment could you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:55.140" style="s2">describe what you mean by the rebirth of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">the logos then in that context well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.140" end="00:02:02.420" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s part of it is taking</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:04.820" style="s2">taking voluntary responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.420" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">appalling conditions of your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.820" end="00:02:10.170" style="s2">essentially that you&#39;re a suffering</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:12.940" style="s2">creature that&#39;s mortal right and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.170" end="00:02:15.400" style="s2">you&#39;re the locus of evil both of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.940" end="00:02:17.410" style="s2">those things and that it&#39;s your response</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.400" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">that your life is about responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.410" end="00:02:24.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s your responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:27.160" style="s2">voluntarily accept that and then to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.610" end="00:02:32.890" style="s2">what you can about it even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.160" end="00:02:34.750" style="s2">in some sense you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.890" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">enterprise doomed to failure in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.750" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">sense because you&#39;re going to die and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:47.110" style="s2">and and the world is a carnage a place</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">of carnage but that that you can accept</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.110" end="00:02:52.210" style="s2">that and if you can&#39;t accept it then</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:54.130" style="s2">what that means is that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.210" end="00:02:56.950" style="s2">integrated enough because if your</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.130" end="00:02:58.450" style="s2">integrated enough then you can accept it</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.950" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like the test of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.450" end="00:03:03.940" style="s2">integration so your your character isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:06.100" style="s2">forged sufficiently if you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.940" end="00:03:07.480" style="s2">tolerate that and it&#39;s not like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.100" end="00:03:09.670" style="s2">easy thing to tolerate often what people</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.480" end="00:03:11.500" style="s2">do is they just don&#39;t think about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.670" end="00:03:16.270" style="s2">they just push it out of their mind and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.500" end="00:03:19.739" style="s2">no wonder but they pay for that with</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.270" end="00:03:22.660" style="s2">shallowness and with self contempt and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.739" end="00:03:26.820" style="s2">with with the inability to bear</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.660" end="00:03:29.080" style="s2">suffering nobly let&#39;s say and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:33.730" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in that that&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.080" end="00:03:36.180" style="s2">people so the rebirth of the logos as</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.730" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned is well it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.180" end="00:03:43.300" style="s2">willingness to take responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">for the shaping of destiny that&#39;s it I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.300" end="00:03:50.800" style="s2">mean the old Mesopotamian God Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:54.580" style="s2">when he became the pinnacle God by</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.800" end="00:03:56.530" style="s2">election basically one of his demands</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.580" end="00:03:59.260" style="s2">from the other gods was that he be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.530" end="00:04:01.600" style="s2">control of the tablet of destiny right</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.260" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an the old idea among the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.600" end="00:04:05.470" style="s2">Mesopotamians was that the highest God</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:07.660" style="s2">was he who was in control of destiny</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.470" end="00:04:10.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like well to the degree that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.660" end="00:04:12.810" style="s2">align yourself properly then you take</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.170" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">responsibility for destiny and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.810" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">that&#39;s a concentric set of circles with</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:22.450" style="s2">no end you know because you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:24.490" style="s2">straighten up yourself and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.450" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">straighten up your family and if you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.490" end="00:04:26.780" style="s2">that property you&#39;re simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:30.820" style="s2">strengthening</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.780" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">community and and and and then you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.820" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">model for your peers and so that starts</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">to spread and we don&#39;t have any idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.530" style="s2">what we would be like if we all got our</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:42.139" style="s2">acts together like we&#39;re pretty amazing</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.530" end="00:04:46.370" style="s2">as it is human beings and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.139" end="00:04:48.620" style="s2">probably devoting who knows what it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.370" end="00:04:50.389" style="s2">in terms of percentage I mean the doubt</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.620" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">a Ching suggests you know that thirty</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.389" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">percent thirty percent of people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:56.480" style="s2">working to make things better and thirty</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.660" style="s2">percent of people are neutral and thirty</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.480" end="00:05:03.290" style="s2">percent are trying to make things worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.660" end="00:05:05.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s obviously a metaphor but but</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.290" end="00:05:07.040" style="s2">there&#39;s some truth in it we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.000" end="00:05:09.230" style="s2">what it would be like what we would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.040" end="00:05:11.000" style="s2">like if we put our effort to making</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.230" end="00:05:12.830" style="s2">things better devoted our effort to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.000" end="00:05:15.950" style="s2">making things better wherever we went</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.830" end="00:05:17.990" style="s2">and it would be interesting to find out</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.950" end="00:05:21.320" style="s2">how would you summarize why men are in</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.990" end="00:05:23.900" style="s2">crisis no I think it&#39;s because in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.320" end="00:05:26.060" style="s2">level the West has lost faith in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.900" end="00:05:28.580" style="s2">idea of masculinity now that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.060" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">different than the death of God it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.580" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:36.979" style="s2">the consequence of that would be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:39.320" style="s2">that&#39;s most of what he wrote about you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.979" end="00:05:41.180" style="s2">know and so you&#39;d say well the divine</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.320" end="00:05:43.190" style="s2">symbol of masculinity has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.180" end="00:05:46.850" style="s2">obliterated well so then what do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.190" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">expect what it what&#39;s gonna happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.850" end="00:05:52.729" style="s2">gonna that means masculinity is going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.800" end="00:05:55.190" style="s2">become weak and especially if the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.729" end="00:05:58.610" style="s2">is also denigrated right which it</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.190" end="00:06:02.650" style="s2">definitely is so what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.610" end="00:06:07.940" style="s2">the ideal that man could aspire to is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.650" end="00:06:09.169" style="s2">denigrated and well then with your ideal</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.940" end="00:06:12.669" style="s2">in tatters</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.169" end="00:06:17.330" style="s2">you&#39;re weak that&#39;s that&#39;s definitional</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.669" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">so I think the reason that men have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.330" end="00:06:24.650" style="s2">responding positively to my my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">let&#39;s say is that I don&#39;t buy any of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.650" end="00:06:34.450" style="s2">that I like the masculine spirit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:37.310" style="s2">necessary and it&#39;s not fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.450" end="00:06:40.940" style="s2">carnage and pillaging it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.310" end="00:06:43.730" style="s2">fundamentally rape culture you know it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.940" end="00:06:45.590" style="s2">not fundamentally world destroying and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.730" end="00:06:47.960" style="s2">all of those things have been all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.590" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">those aspersions have been cast upon it</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.960" end="00:06:52.970" style="s2">that&#39;s partly the guilt of Western</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:57.350" style="s2">society for technological progress even</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.970" end="00:07:02.360" style="s2">and those are reasonable challenges to</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.519" end="00:11:56.100" style="s2">yes exactly exactly exactly well and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:58.350" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a consequence of our</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.589" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">there&#39;s no getting around that now as I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.649" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">said you can distinguish masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">feminine from that and you can speak</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.160" end="00:12:20.130" style="s2">about the psychological components of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:22.680" style="s2">sex as well as the physiological</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.130" end="00:12:26.600" style="s2">components but the real radicals deny</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.680" end="00:12:26.600" style="s2">the physiological components it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.000" end="00:12:32.459" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.570" end="00:12:34.860" style="s2">except when they force other people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.459" end="00:12:36.660" style="s2">do the same kind of denial like people</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.860" end="00:12:39.029" style="s2">are entitled to their opinion but</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.660" end="00:12:41.810" style="s2">they&#39;re not entitled to put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.029" end="00:12:44.370" style="s2">law and so that&#39;s why I was opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.810" end="00:12:46.920" style="s2">not to transgender rights or to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.370" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">transgender people or I mean it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.920" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">a sideshow in in many ways I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.640" end="00:13:30.660" style="s2">something in as Jung talked about the</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.060" end="00:13:53.340" style="s2">know one way of conceptualizing that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.630" end="00:13:55.530" style="s2">in in terms of let&#39;s say in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.340" end="00:13:58.050" style="s2">archetypes well we use the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.530" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">archetypes for for illustration so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.050" end="00:14:03.960" style="s2">could say well for the male generally</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.960" end="00:14:10.620" style="s2">and so that would be partly associated</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.560" end="00:14:13.230" style="s2">with the word that creates order out of</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.150" end="00:14:41.160" style="s2">still the fact that it happens at all is</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.040" end="00:14:45.000" style="s2">is a biological miracle so human being</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.160" end="00:14:48.300" style="s2">males are very maternal for male mammals</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.000" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">or for males period and then females are</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.300" end="00:14:54.690" style="s2">pretty masculine I mean but you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:56.940" style="s2">of see that the the difference to which</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.690" end="00:14:59.640" style="s2">the sexes differ by looking out there</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.940" end="00:15:02.850" style="s2">the difference in their in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.640" end="00:15:05.090" style="s2">physiological configuration you know men</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.850" end="00:15:08.310" style="s2">are bigger and stronger than women and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.090" end="00:15:10.140" style="s2">not a tremendous amount although upper</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.310" end="00:15:12.090" style="s2">body strength there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.140" end="00:15:15.480" style="s2">difference but that&#39;s approximately how</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.090" end="00:15:18.680" style="s2">different they are and that&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.480" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">more the same than they are different</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.680" end="00:15:25.650" style="s2">but the differences aren&#39;t trivial and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.260" end="00:15:28.020" style="s2">the thing is is that differences that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.650" end="00:15:30.810" style="s2">are small at the average can be huge at</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.020" end="00:15:33.810" style="s2">the extremes so you might say well if</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.810" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">you took the most agreeable people say</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.810" end="00:15:38.939" style="s2">the most comparison</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:41.160" style="s2">people out of a hundred and segregated</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.939" end="00:15:43.050" style="s2">them they would all be women all of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.160" end="00:15:45.089" style="s2">and if you took the least agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.050" end="00:15:47.069" style="s2">people and those would often be people</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.089" end="00:15:50.699" style="s2">who have a criminal bent they would all</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.069" end="00:15:53.129" style="s2">be men and often the cultural force is</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.699" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">driven by the extremes not by the middle</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.129" end="00:15:58.589" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t need huge differences</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:01.559" style="s2">in the average to produce relatively</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.589" end="00:16:03.089" style="s2">large differences in in in cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.559" end="00:16:05.699" style="s2">manifestation that&#39;s why there are so</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.089" end="00:16:07.379" style="s2">many men in prison compared to women you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.699" end="00:16:09.990" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.379" end="00:16:11.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s not the sexism of society that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.990" end="00:16:13.980" style="s2">does that although it might be to some</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.610" end="00:16:16.769" style="s2">degree because like male judges give</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.980" end="00:16:18.569" style="s2">female criminals lighter sentences for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.769" end="00:16:21.269" style="s2">example then female judges give female</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.569" end="00:16:29.870" style="s2">criminals so but no one ever talks about</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.269" end="00:16:29.870" style="s2">that so so yes it&#39;s it&#39;s reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.259" end="00:16:35.670" style="s2">note the psychological components of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.240" end="00:16:37.889" style="s2">masculine and feminine let&#39;s say it at a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.670" end="00:16:40.129" style="s2">psychological and symbolic level but to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.889" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">do that at the same time that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.129" end="00:16:45.449" style="s2">denying biological reality and playing</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:48.660" style="s2">an anti patriarchal game behind the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.449" end="00:16:51.660" style="s2">scenes and perhaps masking your Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.660" end="00:16:53.850" style="s2">anti capitalism at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.660" end="00:16:55.559" style="s2">contaminates all of it so badly that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.850" end="00:16:59.160" style="s2">can&#39;t have a reasonable discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.559" end="00:17:01.410" style="s2">so even this the transgender issue that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.160" end="00:17:03.689" style="s2">arose in Canada is so contaminated by</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.410" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">the underlying ideology well first of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.689" end="00:17:07.770" style="s2">all people would have just ignored it if</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:09.329" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the case but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.770" end="00:17:12.510" style="s2">contaminated by the underlying ideology</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.329" end="00:17:17.399" style="s2">that you can&#39;t trust the legislation not</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.510" end="00:17:19.530" style="s2">a bit so and that was my point you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.399" end="00:17:21.750" style="s2">have a quality but then difference is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.530" end="00:17:23.819" style="s2">also essential within that yeah unless</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.750" end="00:17:25.770" style="s2">you want sterile uniformity which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.819" end="00:17:27.059" style="s2">something that only a tyrant wants I</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.770" end="00:17:31.289" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what the tyrant wants a</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.059" end="00:17:34.350" style="s2">sterile uniformity and and the sterile</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.289" end="00:17:37.110" style="s2">is not only ideon &#39;el sterility but</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.350" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">actual physiological sterility no and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.110" end="00:17:42.360" style="s2">that&#39;s no recipe for for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.100" style="s2">continuation of a culture you know and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.360" end="00:17:45.690" style="s2">you can be cynical about that and say</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.100" end="00:17:46.980" style="s2">well you know one cultures as good as</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.690" end="00:17:49.799" style="s2">the next and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.980" end="00:17:52.020" style="s2">no you don&#39;t have any responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.799" end="00:17:54.030" style="s2">continue your culture but it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.020" end="00:17:56.070" style="s2">how you want to construe your life you</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.030" end="00:17:57.570" style="s2">know I mean one of the things that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.070" end="00:18:01.080" style="s2">interesting about the biblical stories</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.570" end="00:18:03.570" style="s2">is that they&#39;re these ancient people had</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.080" end="00:18:06.630" style="s2">a sense of the continuity of life across</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.570" end="00:18:08.490" style="s2">generations that we really don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.630" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s a consequence of I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.490" end="00:18:14.970" style="s2">don&#39;t know a too narrow individualism</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:18.179" style="s2">something like that or or maybe a - or</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.970" end="00:18:21.690" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a present centered hedonism</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.179" end="00:18:23.940" style="s2">but they&#39;re always acting under guidance</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.690" end="00:18:25.860" style="s2">from God let&#39;s say as if the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.940" end="00:18:27.480" style="s2">consequences of their personal actions</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.860" end="00:18:29.640" style="s2">echo down the centuries</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.480" end="00:18:35.790" style="s2">you know indefinitely which they</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.640" end="00:18:38.280" style="s2">actually do you know and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.790" end="00:18:40.020" style="s2">with regards to the issue of what so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.280" end="00:18:41.370" style="s2">need men and women to play the role in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.020" end="00:18:42.780" style="s2">that and they have to play their</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.370" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">masculine and feminine roles</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.780" end="00:18:47.460" style="s2">fundamentally even though male and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:51.390" style="s2">female and masculine feminine are not</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.460" end="00:18:54.059" style="s2">exactly the same idea there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.390" end="00:18:56.220" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to not have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.059" end="00:18:58.919" style="s2">differentiation it should be it should</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.220" end="00:19:00.360" style="s2">be encouraged differentiation I feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.919" end="00:19:02.220" style="s2">like there&#39;s so much in the maps of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.360" end="00:19:03.929" style="s2">meaning and the biblical lectures that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.220" end="00:19:05.970" style="s2">really want to integrate into what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.929" end="00:19:08.220" style="s2">teaching because I think it&#39;s so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.970" end="00:19:10.679" style="s2">essential stuff mm-hmm for orienting</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.220" end="00:19:13.020" style="s2">yourself in the world is it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.679" end="00:19:13.890" style="s2">to be great without it that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.020" end="00:19:15.990" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.890" end="00:19:19.650" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re adrift without it you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.990" end="00:19:22.169" style="s2">to you have to have a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.650" end="00:19:24.270" style="s2">relationship with the archetypes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.169" end="00:19:26.549" style="s2">no way if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.270" end="00:19:30.360" style="s2">susceptible to possession that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.549" end="00:19:32.190" style="s2">basically or - or to despair yeah so and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.360" end="00:19:33.929" style="s2">no wonder well you&#39;ve got to have axioms</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.190" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">so the run yeah seems are the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.929" end="00:19:40.440" style="s2">yes that&#39;s where they exist you see a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:42.630" style="s2">certain axis biological structures there</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.440" end="00:19:44.790" style="s2">at least that yeah they&#39;re preexisting</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.630" end="00:19:49.110" style="s2">their pre-existing categories of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.790" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">perception in the Kantian sense that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.110" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">good way of thinking about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:55.080" style="s2">you know that the peer empiricist thinks</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:19:57.750" style="s2">that you get all your information from</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.080" end="00:19:59.909" style="s2">the outside world right but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.750" end="00:20:00.930" style="s2">true because you bring on a priori</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.909" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">interpretive framework</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.930" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">to the world and that&#39;s instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:09.090" style="s2">biologically but then it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:10.800" style="s2">enculturated so separating the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.090" end="00:20:13.370" style="s2">from the underlying biological reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.800" end="00:20:21.410" style="s2">isn&#39;t easy so you have the snake you</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.370" end="00:20:25.640" style="s2">have the propensity to to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.410" end="00:20:28.110" style="s2">reptilian predators the manner in which</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.640" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">those things are represented in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.110" end="00:20:34.140" style="s2">culture fill those holes essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:35.910" style="s2">so that can same as the language</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.140" end="00:20:37.920" style="s2">instinct so yeah that&#39;s right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.910" end="00:20:40.230" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.920" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">like the archetypes are manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.230" end="00:20:44.250" style="s2">of the universal grammar grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:45.810" style="s2">emotion and motivation that&#39;s a good way</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.250" end="00:20:51.540" style="s2">of thinking about it now they may be</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.810" end="00:20:55.080" style="s2">more than that but because well we you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.540" end="00:20:58.440" style="s2">know I mean life has been moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.080" end="00:21:00.570" style="s2">for 3 and 1/2 billion years and it moves</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.440" end="00:21:02.460" style="s2">forward in these pattered and manners</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.570" end="00:21:03.780" style="s2">like the dominance hierarchy for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.460" end="00:21:05.700" style="s2">so that&#39;s that let&#39;s call that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.780" end="00:21:09.260" style="s2">masculine archetype it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.700" end="00:21:11.610" style="s2">masculine archetype in fact the onus</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.260" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">Proclamation was that the female</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.610" end="00:21:18.180" style="s2">representation of the male so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:21.720" style="s2">animus is the dominance hierarchy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.180" end="00:21:23.880" style="s2">the patriarchy so that&#39;s that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.720" end="00:21:25.710" style="s2">unconscious archetype which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.880" end="00:21:26.970" style="s2">extremely interesting given what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.710" end="00:21:28.830" style="s2">happened say in the women&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.970" end="00:21:32.790" style="s2">because that&#39;s what&#39;s projected onto men</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.830" end="00:21:34.230" style="s2">and and it can be projected in a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.790" end="00:21:37.170" style="s2">negative way it doesn&#39;t have to be but</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.230" end="00:21:39.720" style="s2">it can be and so an animus possessed</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.170" end="00:21:41.040" style="s2">woman treats a man as if he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.720" end="00:21:41.850" style="s2">manifestation of the tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.040" end="00:21:45.420" style="s2">patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.850" end="00:21:47.820" style="s2">he&#39;s a group he&#39;s that group of men yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.420" end="00:21:49.170" style="s2">the group of bad men naturally he spoke</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.820" end="00:21:54.870" style="s2">really well about in connecting the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.170" end="00:21:57.750" style="s2">logos and I found often sharing for</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.870" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">example men &#39;z groups speaking my truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.750" end="00:22:02.310" style="s2">speaking honestly being vulnerable being</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.980" style="s2">open being available has been really</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.310" end="00:22:06.390" style="s2">important I don&#39;t hear you talking so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.980" end="00:22:09.000" style="s2">much about the value of say</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.390" end="00:22:12.060" style="s2">vulnerability or the value of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.000" end="00:22:13.810" style="s2">honesty is that but as a psyche as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.060" end="00:22:15.790" style="s2">psychologist that must be something the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.810" end="00:22:18.370" style="s2">well it&#39;s more just the value of honesty</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.790" end="00:22:21.730" style="s2">in general like you need to say the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.370" end="00:22:25.660" style="s2">things that are you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.730" end="00:22:28.330" style="s2">represent being as accurately as you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.660" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">in your communication right that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.330" end="00:22:33.250" style="s2">of the logos process that&#39;s the truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:36.190" style="s2">its truth oriented to love I think is</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.250" end="00:22:38.800" style="s2">the right formula and love is something</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.190" end="00:22:41.710" style="s2">like the desire for being to flourish</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.800" end="00:22:43.540" style="s2">rather than to be eradicated right those</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.710" end="00:22:46.300" style="s2">are the archetypal realities are you</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.540" end="00:22:49.510" style="s2">working for the flourishing of being or</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.300" end="00:22:51.610" style="s2">for its eradication and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.510" end="00:22:56.350" style="s2">credible case to be made for its</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.610" end="00:23:00.040" style="s2">eradication so but love I think is in</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.350" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">the in the archetypal sense is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.040" end="00:23:10.570" style="s2">desire for being to flourish and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:13.780" style="s2">truth is truth is the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.570" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">represent your relationship with being</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.780" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">in the most precise and accurate manner</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:27.340" style="s2">possible because well you have to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:29.530" style="s2">to reality so you can&#39;t adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.340" end="00:23:32.920" style="s2">something too whose existence you will</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.530" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">not admit and so emotional honesty is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.920" end="00:23:38.680" style="s2">part of that but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:42.300" style="s2">important than any of the other elements</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.680" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">of honesty the vulnerability issue is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.300" end="00:23:47.260" style="s2">your modeling not so much your</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:49.270" style="s2">vulnerability but you&#39;re voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.260" end="00:23:53.140" style="s2">voluntary acceptance of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.270" end="00:23:55.420" style="s2">vulnerability so because to just model</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.140" end="00:23:57.640" style="s2">your vulnerability is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.420" end="00:23:59.530" style="s2">distinguishable from being a victim you</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.640" end="00:24:02.280" style="s2">know I&#39;m hurt and and I&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.530" end="00:24:04.660" style="s2">I&#39;m hurt it&#39;s that isn&#39;t that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.280" end="00:24:07.180" style="s2">that&#39;s not the whole story the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.660" end="00:24:10.170" style="s2">story is well we&#39;re all hurt and some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.180" end="00:24:13.660" style="s2">us more than others certainly but that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.170" end="00:24:17.740" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to come to terms with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.660" end="00:24:20.980" style="s2">and with God&#39;s grace let&#39;s say and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.740" end="00:24:23.920" style="s2">some help from other people to accept</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.980" end="00:24:26.350" style="s2">that and then transcend it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.920" end="00:24:27.500" style="s2">the hope the hope is that you get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.350" end="00:24:29.630" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.500" end="00:24:33.230" style="s2">you&#39;re hurt because otherwise you tend</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.630" end="00:24:37.550" style="s2">to distribute it and and pay it forward</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.230" end="00:24:40.540" style="s2">and and that&#39;s not good obviously what</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.550" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">you&#39;re asked you to to group work or to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.540" end="00:24:44.150" style="s2">sort of some of the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:46.730" style="s2">processing stuff that has come out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.150" end="00:24:48.500" style="s2">say the 60s and 70s I found it very very</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.730" end="00:24:51.770" style="s2">useful that I&#39;ve not heard you speak</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.500" end="00:24:54.410" style="s2">well it can go terribly wrong you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.770" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the reason it did in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.410" end="00:24:58.670" style="s2">some ways died out in in the 60s like it</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.560" style="s2">could go terribly wrong the encounter</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.670" end="00:25:02.450" style="s2">groups are often very hard on people it</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.560" end="00:25:04.040" style="s2">can easily become tyrannical and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.450" end="00:25:08.690" style="s2">totalitarian and I&#39;ve seen that happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.040" end="00:25:12.050" style="s2">very rapidly in in group situations but</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.690" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">I mean group work it&#39;s part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.050" end="00:25:16.610" style="s2">that you integrate yourself into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:18.290" style="s2">society so it&#39;s necessary it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.610" end="00:25:20.660" style="s2">that group work would be prone to all</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.290" end="00:25:23.030" style="s2">those potential catastrophes because</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.660" end="00:25:28.070" style="s2">those are the catastrophes of groups but</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.030" end="00:25:29.270" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary and I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.070" end="00:25:30.890" style="s2">lectures that I&#39;m doing for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.270" end="00:25:33.290" style="s2">there&#39;s group work there because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.890" end="00:25:35.870" style="s2">an audience right a crowd and people</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.290" end="00:25:37.490" style="s2">like the live part of it and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.870" end="00:25:40.040" style="s2">difference between speaking to people</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.490" end="00:25:41.750" style="s2">live in a group and speaking to them say</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.040" end="00:25:45.860" style="s2">through electronic means there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.750" end="00:25:49.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a collective spirit</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.860" end="00:25:50.540" style="s2">let&#39;s say that manifests itself in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.340" end="00:25:51.830" style="s2">room and that&#39;s a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.540" end="00:25:55.850" style="s2">everyone imitating everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.830" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">unconsciously and and so and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.850" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">a very powerful thing and can also be</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:02.060" style="s2">provide direction because maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:03.920" style="s2">you&#39;re fortunate and things are coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.060" end="00:26:07.010" style="s2">together properly in the room it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.920" end="00:26:08.780" style="s2">best part of the crowd that rises up and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.010" end="00:26:10.430" style="s2">then that rises up as a kind of ideal</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.780" end="00:26:12.050" style="s2">and then that sort of possesses each</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.430" end="00:26:13.550" style="s2">individual because they can see that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.050" end="00:26:16.040" style="s2">they&#39;re supported in their journey</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.550" end="00:26:18.200" style="s2">forward and that these things can be and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.040" end="00:26:20.090" style="s2">they can look around and think well</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.200" end="00:26:22.550" style="s2">these other people are taking this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.090" end="00:26:24.350" style="s2">seriously and paying attention and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.550" end="00:26:26.360" style="s2">there&#39;s something to take serious here</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.350" end="00:26:29.270" style="s2">seriously here and to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.360" end="00:26:32.180" style="s2">and so that&#39;s all good but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.270" end="00:26:34.970" style="s2">be very aware that of the pitfalls and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.180" end="00:26:37.550" style="s2">and so you have to beat yourself with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.970" end="00:26:40.940" style="s2">stick so that you mean you retain the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.550" end="00:26:41.420" style="s2">proper humility and the humility ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.940" end="00:26:43.250" style="s2">are very</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.420" end="00:26:45.050" style="s2">complicated one and I think what that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.250" end="00:26:47.690" style="s2">in essence is that you have to remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.050" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">all the time that what you don&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.690" end="00:26:51.560" style="s2">more important than what you know you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:54.170" style="s2">have to remember that as if your life</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.560" end="00:26:55.940" style="s2">depends on it because it does I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.170" end="00:26:57.530" style="s2">even technically because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.940" end="00:27:00.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.530" end="00:27:02.990" style="s2">like you&#39;re prone to catastrophe so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.680" end="00:27:04.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough by definition and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.990" end="00:27:08.780" style="s2">you know that and understand that then</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.820" end="00:27:11.300" style="s2">that can reduce the temptation to to act</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.780" end="00:27:12.860" style="s2">in a manner that would be totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.300" end="00:27:16.610" style="s2">or tyrannical and that can facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.860" end="00:27:20.810" style="s2">the group work you know so it&#39;s risky</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.610" end="00:27:22.370" style="s2">but everything&#39;s risky and just coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.810" end="00:27:24.050" style="s2">back to the idea of the rebirth of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.370" end="00:27:25.850" style="s2">logos something&#39;s been coming up quite a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.050" end="00:27:28.130" style="s2">lot recently as the idea of initiation</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.850" end="00:27:30.490" style="s2">and I there&#39;s a couple of organizations</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.130" end="00:27:36.380" style="s2">in the UK one called Band of Brothers</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.490" end="00:27:38.930" style="s2">which is using men&#39;s work initiation</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.380" end="00:27:41.300" style="s2">work of some description to take</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.930" end="00:27:42.650" style="s2">disadvantaged youths and to give them a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.300" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">sense of direction give them a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.650" end="00:27:46.790" style="s2">purpose give them a sense of dignity</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:49.060" style="s2">well part of that&#39;s part of what an</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.790" end="00:27:52.090" style="s2">initiation is for like part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.060" end="00:27:55.490" style="s2">exposure to that which terrifies you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.090" end="00:27:58.010" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it but then in the state</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.490" end="00:28:00.470" style="s2">that that produces you&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.010" end="00:28:02.870" style="s2">inculcated with the cultural wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.470" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">that partly is direction I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.870" end="00:28:08.150" style="s2">what older men have to provide it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:10.910" style="s2">the case with elephants you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.150" end="00:28:12.830" style="s2">young elephants herd has been decimated</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.910" end="00:28:14.660" style="s2">and the old guys are gone the young guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.830" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">basically go insane they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.660" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">uncontrollable and obviously that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.760" end="00:28:21.470" style="s2">case with human beings and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:23.390" style="s2">purpose of mature men or the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.470" end="00:28:26.750" style="s2">responsibility of mature men is to give</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.390" end="00:28:32.210" style="s2">young men is to be models obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.750" end="00:28:34.130" style="s2">mostly models of direction yeah well you</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.210" end="00:28:36.530" style="s2">need direction you uni and you need</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.130" end="00:28:38.930" style="s2">there has to be a rationale for aiming</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.530" end="00:28:41.450" style="s2">up because that&#39;s direction you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.930" end="00:28:43.130" style="s2">aim down that&#39;s just why would you aim</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.450" end="00:28:44.900" style="s2">down unless you were angry and bitter</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.130" end="00:28:47.900" style="s2">and resentful and you know full of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.900" end="00:28:50.090" style="s2">hatred and all that you aim up and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.900" end="00:28:53.240" style="s2">but that has to be put forward in a way</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.090" end="00:28:55.370" style="s2">that isn&#39;t this too tight corset</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.240" end="00:28:58.180" style="s2">grandmotherly moralizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.370" end="00:29:01.070" style="s2">because anybody with any sense who isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.180" end="00:29:04.340" style="s2">overly domesticated is just gonna reject</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.070" end="00:29:05.870" style="s2">that so you know that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.340" end="00:29:07.730" style="s2">morality that Nietzsche described his</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.870" end="00:29:10.040" style="s2">cowardice right he said most people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.730" end="00:29:13.870" style="s2">morality is cowardice it&#39;s it&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.040" end="00:29:15.950" style="s2">afraid they&#39;re afraid to be bad and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.870" end="00:29:17.780" style="s2">because they&#39;re afraid they think</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.950" end="00:29:20.270" style="s2">they&#39;re good but they&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.780" end="00:29:23.390" style="s2">they&#39;re just afraid and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.270" end="00:29:25.670" style="s2">morality morality is a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.390" end="00:29:27.470" style="s2">issue and it&#39;s partly aiming up but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.670" end="00:29:30.290" style="s2">also partly gathering your forces</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.470" end="00:29:33.500" style="s2">together so that you aren&#39;t interfered</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.290" end="00:29:37.660" style="s2">with well you&#39;re moving upward so</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.500" end="00:29:39.650" style="s2">because you you will be people test it</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.660" end="00:29:41.420" style="s2">do you think the central problem of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.650" end="00:29:43.580" style="s2">Western societies that were intent on</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.420" end="00:29:46.670" style="s2">slamming off responsibility at every</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.580" end="00:29:49.400" style="s2">level any society where people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.670" end="00:29:53.230" style="s2">shying away from responsibility is is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.400" end="00:29:55.820" style="s2">society that&#39;s self crippling because</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.230" end="00:29:59.450" style="s2">the responsibility is to do the work</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.820" end="00:30:03.010" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary to revitalize and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.450" end="00:30:05.870" style="s2">culture to rescue it&#39;s it&#39;s fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.010" end="00:30:08.930" style="s2">axioms from the darkness to revitalize</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.870" end="00:30:11.240" style="s2">it and to have it expand and grow and if</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.930" end="00:30:13.340" style="s2">that isn&#39;t happening then anything that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.240" end="00:30:15.350" style="s2">isn&#39;t growing dies you know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.340" end="00:30:22.610" style="s2">sort of a fundamental truth of life and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.350" end="00:30:24.890" style="s2">so so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.610" end="00:30:27.260" style="s2">central problem of the West because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.890" end="00:30:29.210" style="s2">not like there aren&#39;t people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.260" end="00:30:34.040" style="s2">taking responsibility in the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.210" end="00:30:38.330" style="s2">world but it&#39;s enough of a problem in</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.040" end="00:30:40.400" style="s2">the West that it threatens us and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.330" end="00:30:42.470" style="s2">think that&#39;s particularly felt by young</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.400" end="00:30:45.020" style="s2">men I think the reason for that in part</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.470" end="00:30:47.630" style="s2">is that there&#39;s the direction for young</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.020" end="00:30:49.340" style="s2">women in some sense is more obvious both</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.630" end="00:30:52.940" style="s2">culturally and biologically because</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.340" end="00:30:55.370" style="s2">young women are encouraged if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.940" end="00:30:56.870" style="s2">attempting to manifest the logos let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.370" end="00:30:58.970" style="s2">say they&#39;re definitely encouraged in</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.870" end="00:31:01.880" style="s2">that there&#39;s no doubt about it and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.970" end="00:31:04.660" style="s2">as a backup they have the divine mother</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.880" end="00:31:08.030" style="s2">and child and so they&#39;re kind of set</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.660" end="00:31:08.900" style="s2">with men it&#39;s more this is perhaps why</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.030" end="00:31:12.740" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.900" end="00:31:15.410" style="s2">have always undergone a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.740" end="00:31:21.020" style="s2">initiation because they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.410" end="00:31:22.550" style="s2">directed more in a more art in a more</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.020" end="00:31:25.700" style="s2">articulate manner in a more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.550" end="00:31:28.820" style="s2">manner they have to be inculcated with</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.700" end="00:31:31.010" style="s2">the culture in order to decide that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.820" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">adopting responsibility is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.010" end="00:31:35.059" style="s2">appropriate thing to do and they need a</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:36.950" style="s2">rationale for that because why the hell</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.059" end="00:31:39.950" style="s2">would you adopt responsibility without a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.950" end="00:31:44.150" style="s2">rationale it&#39;s way like the default</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.950" end="00:31:47.450" style="s2">position is aimless impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.150" end="00:31:48.890" style="s2">pleasure-seeking and inertia because all</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.450" end="00:31:51.920" style="s2">you have to do to have that is do</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.890" end="00:31:53.960" style="s2">nothing and that&#39;s easy so then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.920" end="00:31:55.130" style="s2">question immediate question is well why</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.960" end="00:31:57.230" style="s2">not just do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.130" end="00:31:59.920" style="s2">and what one of the answers is because</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.230" end="00:32:02.780" style="s2">you and the world will go to hell and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.920" end="00:32:05.210" style="s2">very rapidly and that&#39;s a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.780" end="00:32:07.190" style="s2">answer and it&#39;s actually true now you</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.210" end="00:32:09.740" style="s2">know what that means in any eternal</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.190" end="00:32:15.040" style="s2">sense is not an easy thing to say but</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.740" end="00:32:20.059" style="s2">the proximal sense is true enough so</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.040" end="00:32:26.150" style="s2">even in action is not morally acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.059" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">in the face of the unkempt unfinished</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.150" end="00:32:32.660" style="s2">state of being I guess that&#39;s a</p>
