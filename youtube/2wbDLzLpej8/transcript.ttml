<p begin="00:01:23.220" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">and a little bit of what you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">maybe before you got the bright part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">course I mean I&#39;m I&#39;ll preface this by</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">saying I&#39;m terrible about talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">myself but I&#39;ll do my best so I did my</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">studies at Oxford back in graduated in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">2013 then started off working in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">politics actually for liberals real</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:50.790" style="s2">liberals real liberals well I say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">like the party I work for the Liberal</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.790" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">Democrat Party in the UK is not what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">describe as liberal at anyway at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">moment but there were a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:01:59.969" style="s2">liberal back then they&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">quite good on civil liberties and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.969" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">protecting people against surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">and so on but right now they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:06.530" style="s2">like a social justice warrior and tybor</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:10.550" style="s2">exit party</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.530" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">but that&#39;s why I was doing in 2013 2014</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.550" end="00:02:13.780" style="s2">then I started working for a political</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:16.930" style="s2">consultant</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.780" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">a very globalist which was extremely an</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.930" end="00:02:21.430" style="s2">extremely boring office job where large</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:23.190" style="s2">corporations paid us lots of money to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.430" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">tell them what&#39;s going on in politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.190" end="00:02:28.420" style="s2">political consultants is a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">glamorous and sinister than you&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.420" end="00:02:32.440" style="s2">it&#39;s generally just people informing</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:33.430" style="s2">other people about what&#39;s going on at</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.440" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">least that&#39;s how it was at the place</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.430" end="00:02:40.060" style="s2">where I worked but at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:42.970" style="s2">was sort of very extremely online I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.060" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">always very into the dark corners of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.970" end="00:02:47.709" style="s2">internet for Chan reddit the reddit is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:50.650" style="s2">probably mainstream and for Chan&#39;s eyes</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.709" end="00:02:52.180" style="s2">and I was seeing all these sort of new</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.650" end="00:02:53.800" style="s2">cultural battles happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.180" end="00:02:55.420" style="s2">Millennial Generation well anyway you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.800" end="00:02:58.450" style="s2">you got involved in this just because</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.420" end="00:02:59.890" style="s2">you had personal interest or yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.450" end="00:03:01.900" style="s2">just curious at all these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.890" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">controversies that were erupting on</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.900" end="00:03:05.860" style="s2">social media I mean these on these web</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:10.420" style="s2">sites and communities in 2013 and 2014</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.860" end="00:03:11.890" style="s2">and the biggest one that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.420" end="00:03:16.360" style="s2">led into my Breitbart job was gamergate</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.890" end="00:03:18.250" style="s2">in 2014 so when I saw that starting I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.360" end="00:03:19.600" style="s2">thought well you know this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.250" end="00:03:22.060" style="s2">be big because they&#39;ve been a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.600" end="00:03:24.160" style="s2">of previous sort of social justice</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.060" end="00:03:25.390" style="s2">warrior versus anti social justice</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.160" end="00:03:27.010" style="s2">warrior contra buzz it&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.390" end="00:03:29.530" style="s2">the year leading up to that and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.010" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">seemed like there was this big battle</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.530" end="00:03:32.620" style="s2">about to take place and no one really</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.120" style="s2">understood it because no one was</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.620" end="00:03:35.500" style="s2">following those communities know most</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.120" end="00:03:37.299" style="s2">following reddit and fortunate back in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.500" end="00:03:39.670" style="s2">those days right could you could you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.299" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">give just like a 30-second summary on</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.670" end="00:03:42.609" style="s2">what gamergate is because I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.170" style="s2">probably more than half the people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.609" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">listening to the podcast you say</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.170" end="00:03:47.829" style="s2">gamergate they have no idea what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:49.510" style="s2">means but to me gamergate is like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.829" end="00:03:51.070" style="s2">shot heard around the world that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.510" end="00:03:53.350" style="s2">got us to where we are today you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.070" end="00:03:54.970" style="s2">almost trace back so much what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.350" end="00:03:57.549" style="s2">happening today back to gamergate so</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.970" end="00:04:01.290" style="s2">could you just like sum it up real quick</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.549" end="00:04:04.829" style="s2">absolutely so short answer is it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.290" end="00:04:07.299" style="s2">battle between online gamers and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.829" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">feminists and left-wing journalists over</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.299" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">political correctness and media bias and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">lack of media ethics in games journalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:18.789" style="s2">which sounds like a very niche sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:20.410" style="s2">topic that would n be interesting to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.789" end="00:04:22.570" style="s2">few people but you have to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.410" end="00:04:24.190" style="s2">gaming was like it&#39;s the hobby of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.570" end="00:04:26.990" style="s2">millennial generation millions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.190" end="00:04:30.020" style="s2">millions of people play video games</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.990" end="00:04:31.639" style="s2">and while at the same time you had</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.020" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">things like campus censorship going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.639" end="00:04:34.849" style="s2">when someone sent it on campus that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.699" style="s2">affects maybe 200 students who might</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.849" end="00:04:40.759" style="s2">have gone to see the talk but if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.699" end="00:04:42.020" style="s2">insert little correctness or get a video</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.759" end="00:04:44.270" style="s2">game censored that would affect</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.020" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">potentially millions of fans and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.270" end="00:04:46.580" style="s2">what that&#39;s also why we see</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:48.440" style="s2">controversies happening over</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.580" end="00:04:51.050" style="s2">Ghostbusters and Star Wars and all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.440" end="00:04:53.090" style="s2">pop culture phenomenon because you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.050" end="00:04:54.169" style="s2">it does matter to like millions of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.090" end="00:04:55.220" style="s2">millions of people who enjoy those</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.169" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">things and don&#39;t want to see them</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.220" end="00:04:59.479" style="s2">politicized and censored right and these</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:01.400" style="s2">are multi multi-billion dollar</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.479" end="00:05:03.229" style="s2">industries this isn&#39;t just like some you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.400" end="00:05:04.819" style="s2">know backwater thing of course so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.229" end="00:05:06.409" style="s2">why it turned into a big thing and even</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.819" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">though so many people thought well this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.409" end="00:05:10.759" style="s2">is just like a niche hobby it&#39;ll blow</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:12.740" style="s2">over in a few days actually that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.759" end="00:05:15.289" style="s2">controversy ran on for over a year and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.740" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">people still talk about it today partly</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.289" end="00:05:20.090" style="s2">because so many people were involved</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:23.030" style="s2">with billions of gamers but also because</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.090" end="00:05:24.919" style="s2">it was the first time where I think you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.030" end="00:05:26.840" style="s2">saw the dominance of left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.919" end="00:05:30.169" style="s2">Millennials being challenged on social</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.840" end="00:05:33.289" style="s2">media so up until 2014 when gaming it</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.169" end="00:05:34.849" style="s2">started the left and left-wing activists</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.289" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">sort of dominated social media it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.849" end="00:05:38.570" style="s2">like their playground it was where they</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.220" end="00:07:45.610" style="s2">who appeared to be anonymous on 4chan</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.960" end="00:07:47.080" style="s2">who were making lots of posts at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.610" end="00:07:49.930" style="s2">time saying you need to be on Twitter if</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.450" end="00:08:14.920" style="s2">huge followings during gamergate because</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.720" end="00:08:16.780" style="s2">it turned into something that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.920" end="00:08:18.340" style="s2">just limited to games it was more like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.780" end="00:08:19.720" style="s2">generalized backlash against this</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.340" end="00:08:21.640" style="s2">culture of political correctness this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.720" end="00:08:23.950" style="s2">culture of public shaming that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.640" end="00:08:26.920" style="s2">coming out of left wing right I think I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.950" end="00:08:29.080" style="s2">think I remember the tag line was free</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.920" end="00:08:31.540" style="s2">speech in games journalism right</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.080" end="00:08:32.979" style="s2">something like that yeah but so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.540" end="00:08:34.870" style="s2">would that what would somebody from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.979" end="00:08:36.370" style="s2">left&#39;s say was the real issue around</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.870" end="00:08:37.390" style="s2">gamergate cuz that&#39;s that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.370" end="00:08:38.830" style="s2">they would say they wouldn&#39;t say it</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.390" end="00:08:40.840" style="s2">wasn&#39;t about free speech it was about</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.830" end="00:08:42.580" style="s2">what oh yeah the narrative from the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.840" end="00:08:44.700" style="s2">was that this is a huge harassment</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.580" end="00:08:48.070" style="s2">campaign led by bigots who hate</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.700" end="00:08:50.750" style="s2">progressive values and hate feminists</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.070" end="00:08:53.480" style="s2">and women and minorities</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.750" end="00:08:56.450" style="s2">and yeah actually it was in in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.480" end="00:08:58.030" style="s2">cases a dress rehearsal for 2016 because</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.450" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">he saw exactly the same narrative</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.030" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">emerging about Trump supporters that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.590" style="s2">they&#39;re coming from these dark corners</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.930" style="s2">of the Internet to harass journalists</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.590" end="00:09:07.820" style="s2">that they&#39;re all hateful bigots they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.930" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">all deplorable</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.820" end="00:09:12.740" style="s2">so it was like a test run because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:15.260" style="s2">only way that the left can respond to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.740" end="00:09:17.030" style="s2">these emergent movements that come out</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.260" end="00:09:19.280" style="s2">and challenge them is to sort of smear</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.030" end="00:09:20.600" style="s2">the entire movement and cast it as</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.280" end="00:09:22.340" style="s2">illegitimate right</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.600" end="00:09:23.840" style="s2">anybody who participates in it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.340" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">obviously a terrible horrible rotten</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.840" end="00:09:28.070" style="s2">person and forget about whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:29.960" style="s2">principle is that they&#39;re defending it</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.070" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">really just comes down to social social</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.960" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">you know exile and personal attacks and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:36.440" style="s2">smears like that indeed yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:38.330" style="s2">it that&#39;s very fascinating you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.440" end="00:09:39.560" style="s2">gamergate gets a gets a lot of attention</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.330" end="00:09:42.290" style="s2">in the circles that we run in I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.560" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">know that there&#39;s been a definitive like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.290" end="00:09:47.330" style="s2">gamergate book written or something that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:49.070" style="s2">really tracks the way that this has had</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.330" end="00:09:50.660" style="s2">an influence I think even on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.070" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">election and who&#39;s in the White House</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.660" end="00:09:55.700" style="s2">and you know moving forward as a as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">beginning of these online insurgencies</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.700" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">and these collective eyes intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:01.070" style="s2">networks that that don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:04.280" style="s2">have a leader I do remember very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.070" end="00:10:06.050" style="s2">back then people would say they say</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.280" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">mockingly like I am the leader of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.050" end="00:10:09.380" style="s2">gamergate and everyone would be saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:10.820" style="s2">that because there was no leader of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.380" end="00:10:14.089" style="s2">gamergate right I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.820" end="00:10:15.320" style="s2">yeah I know of Jonas we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.089" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">find a leader because that&#39;s the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.320" end="00:10:18.620" style="s2">way to take out a movement you know you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:20.930" style="s2">find it&#39;s like classic alinsky tactics</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.620" end="00:10:22.490" style="s2">you know you find the leader you isolate</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.930" end="00:10:24.230" style="s2">them you personalize them you destroy</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.490" end="00:10:26.089" style="s2">their reputation we&#39;ve seen it happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.230" end="00:10:28.010" style="s2">again and again and there was a book</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.089" end="00:10:29.810" style="s2">about gamergate i believe brad glasgow a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.010" end="00:10:31.250" style="s2">fairly unbiased journalist has written a</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.280" end="00:10:43.250" style="s2">those were misses and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:45.650" style="s2">political ramifications you often hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.250" end="00:10:47.270" style="s2">left-wing journalists who were involved</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.650" end="00:10:50.030" style="s2">in trying to smear game I get talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.270" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2">about how if everyone had just listened</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.030" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">to them back then the Trump movement</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.630" end="00:13:11.180" style="s2">they weren&#39;t sure what it was about</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.500" end="00:13:13.610" style="s2">obviously the young millennial reporters</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.180" end="00:13:14.690" style="s2">a place like BuzzFeed and Gawker and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.610" end="00:13:15.860" style="s2">video game and it didn&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.690" end="00:13:16.790" style="s2">was about and they were attacking it</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.860" end="00:13:17.520" style="s2">relentlessly but there were no</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.790" end="00:13:19.080" style="s2">journalists</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.520" end="00:13:21.540" style="s2">on the other side presenting a different</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.080" end="00:13:24.440" style="s2">view and challenging that narrative so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.540" end="00:13:27.410" style="s2">as it was all kicking off I sent the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.440" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">breakdown up the story to Breitbart</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.410" end="00:13:32.790" style="s2">bright but initially you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:34.230" style="s2">going on but I sort of explained it to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.790" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">them and then they started covering it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.230" end="00:13:38.730" style="s2">and that became a very big deal and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:39.840" style="s2">was how I ended up working for Breitbart</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.730" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">cuz I venture started writing articles</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.840" end="00:13:43.080" style="s2">for them as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:44.850" style="s2">got it got it so were you trained in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.080" end="00:13:46.140" style="s2">journalism did you study that in school</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.850" end="00:13:48.450" style="s2">were you on your high school newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.140" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">or was was this something that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.450" end="00:13:53.820" style="s2">sort of evolved into it&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:55.980" style="s2">evolved into my background my academic</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.820" end="00:13:57.840" style="s2">background is history in politics and my</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.980" end="00:14:00.120" style="s2">professional back was politics well but</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.840" end="00:14:01.260" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a fairly you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.120" end="00:14:02.790" style="s2">of overlap between journalism and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.260" end="00:14:05.280" style="s2">politics especially these days so it</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.790" end="00:14:07.950" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t too difficult to to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.280" end="00:14:09.480" style="s2">into journalism and started to learn the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.950" end="00:14:10.650" style="s2">ropes laughs so you just started sending</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.480" end="00:14:11.940" style="s2">bright bright information and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.650" end="00:14:14.490" style="s2">eventually they hired you on to write</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">about the subject basically yes and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.490" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2">the widest subject about tank censorship</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:20.520" style="s2">and the social justice warrior movement</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:21.660" style="s2">and the opposition to it great and what</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.520" end="00:14:24.690" style="s2">year was that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.660" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">that was 2014 2015 I joined right but</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.690" end="00:14:29.730" style="s2">formally in October 2015 or just when</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:31.320" style="s2">right but tank was set up got it okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.730" end="00:14:33.720" style="s2">which brings me to the first time that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.320" end="00:14:35.310" style="s2">ever saw your name which was and and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.720" end="00:14:37.560" style="s2">know I&#39;m sure you were doing work before</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.310" end="00:14:39.720" style="s2">this and and you know I&#39;m not certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.560" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">the sole purveyor of what&#39;s out there in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.720" end="00:14:43.860" style="s2">this world but they were the first time</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:46.140" style="s2">I saw your name was around the taxidermy</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.860" end="00:14:47.850" style="s2">article on the alt-right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.140" end="00:14:49.530" style="s2">that that was right around that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.850" end="00:14:52.710" style="s2">it a bit later I think it was it was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.530" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">summer of 2016 when the old riot was</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.710" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">sort of something that everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:58.440" style="s2">everyone the media was talking about at</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:15:00.270" style="s2">the time right so tell me tell me about</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.440" end="00:15:02.940" style="s2">now this was like a seminal article I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.270" end="00:15:04.590" style="s2">remember people didn&#39;t know nobody knew</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.940" end="00:15:06.530" style="s2">what all right was what all right meant</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.590" end="00:15:09.240" style="s2">what the frame with the the term meant</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.530" end="00:15:11.280" style="s2">who was under this umbrella did anybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.240" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">actually pick up the umbrella and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.280" end="00:15:15.540" style="s2">know the banner and run with it it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:17.160" style="s2">this amorphous weird thing that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.540" end="00:15:19.710" style="s2">people so when I first heard the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.160" end="00:15:22.380" style="s2">alright my perspective on it was like</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.710" end="00:15:23.670" style="s2">okay I used speed I was Democrat don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.380" end="00:15:26.370" style="s2">want to be a Democrat anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.670" end="00:15:28.360" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone crazy I never wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.370" end="00:15:31.690" style="s2">part of my grandfather&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:33.880" style="s2">you know good old Grand Old Party GOP</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.690" end="00:15:36.550" style="s2">Republicans I never saw them as my</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.880" end="00:15:38.560" style="s2">people and so when I heard the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.550" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">alright I thought okay this is something</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.560" end="00:15:43.030" style="s2">that I could get with because it sounded</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">like a cool name first of all and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.030" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">seemed to me to signal that you know not</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.620" style="s2">Democrat not a Republican but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:53.530" style="s2">now finding myself on the right side of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.620" end="00:15:55.960" style="s2">Center and so I even tried out the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.530" end="00:15:58.930" style="s2">alt-right myself and once I started to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.960" end="00:16:00.700" style="s2">learn more about what it meant you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.930" end="00:16:03.100" style="s2">I definitely shucked that but your</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.700" end="00:16:04.870" style="s2">article that you think you did in</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.080" end="00:16:11.740" style="s2">that sort of had taken on the name all</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:13.900" style="s2">right one just tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.740" end="00:16:16.150" style="s2">about the impetus for the article what</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.900" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">your thought process was in writing it</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.150" end="00:16:19.630" style="s2">and we can also talk about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:21.940" style="s2">ramifications of the - well at the time</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.630" end="00:16:25.570" style="s2">we wrote that article I believe it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.940" end="00:16:27.190" style="s2">around April 2016 alright was just</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.570" end="00:16:28.810" style="s2">emerging and as you said lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.190" end="00:16:34.300" style="s2">were claiming it and it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.810" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">have a clear identity and the point of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.300" end="00:16:38.140" style="s2">the article was to explain what groups</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.310" end="00:16:40.450" style="s2">and what individuals were claiming the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.140" end="00:16:42.670" style="s2">label now at the time it was a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.450" end="00:16:45.670" style="s2">broad mix of people who claim the label</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.670" end="00:16:49.090" style="s2">obviously six months later I&#39;d say by</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.670" end="00:16:51.250" style="s2">the time of September November 2016</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.090" end="00:16:53.020" style="s2">around the election it would it had been</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.840" end="00:22:38.030" style="s2">hearing that and I&#39;m sure it was before</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.290" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">this evolved definition came into play</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.030" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">and it was really in reference to this</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">disaffected group of people that embrace</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:44.810" style="s2">technology don&#39;t want to be a Democrat</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.700" end="00:22:49.490" style="s2">things forward but yeah the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.260" end="00:22:52.940" style="s2">you&#39;ll never have in mainstream media is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.490" end="00:22:55.670" style="s2">at the definition that was used back in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.940" end="00:22:56.990" style="s2">early 2016 and what the old quite turned</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.670" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">into later in the year were two</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.990" end="00:23:01.430" style="s2">different things right never and I even</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">I you know I wrote a very long essay</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.430" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">about my exploration of the alright and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:08.900" style="s2">what it meant because I early like in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:10.190" style="s2">late 2015 maybe I might use that word to</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.900" end="00:23:12.230" style="s2">describe myself oh my god man that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.190" end="00:23:13.970" style="s2">sounds cool but then I started reaching</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.230" end="00:23:16.160" style="s2">out to guys like Richard Spencer and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.970" end="00:23:18.230" style="s2">other idiots to ask them what their what</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">their ideas were and and what they had</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.230" end="00:23:21.740" style="s2">in mind for government or policy or what</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:22.910" style="s2">their visions for the future were and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.740" end="00:23:24.830" style="s2">the more I learned about it the more I</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.910" end="00:23:26.090" style="s2">realized they were insane and I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.830" end="00:23:27.740" style="s2">nothing to do with it and I wrote a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.090" end="00:23:29.720" style="s2">long essay about it and it gets read on</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.740" end="00:23:31.250" style="s2">my website you know a couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.720" end="00:23:33.470" style="s2">times a month but that&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.250" end="00:23:35.060" style="s2">enough to to change the change the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.470" end="00:23:36.500" style="s2">mainstream narrative but it does help</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.060" end="00:23:39.170" style="s2">anybody that wants to learn about me</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.500" end="00:23:40.760" style="s2">understand that process and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.170" end="00:23:43.730" style="s2">people went through the similar</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.760" end="00:23:45.890" style="s2">exploration and evolution and have</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.730" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">learned now to stay the away from</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.890" end="00:23:49.640" style="s2">all of those people so yeah why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:51.530" style="s2">talk a bit more about why the old Freud</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.640" end="00:23:55.300" style="s2">isn&#39;t saying I think this isn&#39;t explored</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.530" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">often enough you know the way I see</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.300" end="00:23:59.650" style="s2">increasingly see politics and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:02.630" style="s2">the way it&#39;s always historically been</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.650" end="00:24:04.160" style="s2">philosophically is that politics is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.630" end="00:24:05.780" style="s2">about you know how much how far do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.160" end="00:24:07.880" style="s2">embrace human nature and how far do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.780" end="00:24:10.340" style="s2">try and contain it because a society</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.880" end="00:24:11.190" style="s2">that just lets human nature run wild is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.340" end="00:24:13.260" style="s2">a isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.190" end="00:24:15.390" style="s2">society&#39;s not civilization its barbarism</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.260" end="00:24:17.550" style="s2">the definition of civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.390" end="00:24:18.810" style="s2">containing the worst aspects of human</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.550" end="00:24:22.860" style="s2">nature that&#39;s the point that Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.810" end="00:24:24.300" style="s2">Hobbes made in the Leviathan but a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.860" end="00:24:26.070" style="s2">society that goes too far towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.300" end="00:24:27.540" style="s2">controlling human nature is a tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.070" end="00:24:30.330" style="s2">society that&#39;s what the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.540" end="00:24:31.800" style="s2">tried to do so I think what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.330" end="00:24:33.210" style="s2">alt-right want to do is they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.800" end="00:24:35.420" style="s2">saying all these negative aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.210" end="00:24:37.830" style="s2">human nature like racism and bigotry and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.420" end="00:24:39.510" style="s2">ethnic tribalism are good things and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.830" end="00:24:41.310" style="s2">should be embraced I think no</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.510" end="00:24:43.110" style="s2">right-thinking people agrees with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.310" end="00:24:45.450" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.110" end="00:24:47.880" style="s2">I think be the pragmatic way to look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.450" end="00:24:50.190" style="s2">it is that yes racism and tribalism do</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.880" end="00:24:51.930" style="s2">exist and when you bring groups in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.190" end="00:24:53.400" style="s2">close proximity there will always be</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.930" end="00:24:56.370" style="s2">people inside them who try and create</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.400" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">conflict and divide that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.370" end="00:24:59.730" style="s2">reasons why you have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:01.650" style="s2">about mass immigration because you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.730" end="00:25:04.220" style="s2">it will lead to at least in the short</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.650" end="00:25:06.870" style="s2">term a lot of conflict and strife and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.220" end="00:25:08.700" style="s2">the way societies then try and control</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.870" end="00:25:11.940" style="s2">that conflict and strife is bypassing</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.700" end="00:25:14.810" style="s2">hate speech laws and cracking down on</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.940" end="00:25:17.190" style="s2">freedom of speech so it in Everett and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.810" end="00:25:20.430" style="s2">control those negative aspects of human</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.190" end="00:25:22.650" style="s2">nature so I think the way to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.430" end="00:25:27.210" style="s2">is not the way the old right looks at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.650" end="00:25:29.250" style="s2">which is all this ethnic identity is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.210" end="00:25:30.840" style="s2">good thing you know that&#39;s this that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.250" end="00:25:32.580" style="s2">know that that&#39;s that&#39;s Cupid and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.840" end="00:25:34.710" style="s2">leans towards barbarism it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.580" end="00:25:37.290" style="s2">civilized no no civilized person would</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.710" end="00:25:38.670" style="s2">believe in that but you also can&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.290" end="00:25:41.220" style="s2">at it the way the left looks at it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.670" end="00:25:42.810" style="s2">that well let&#39;s just have open borders</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.220" end="00:25:44.970" style="s2">and you know if there are negative</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.810" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">aspects of human nature like racism that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.970" end="00:25:47.850" style="s2">starts showing themselves we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:49.650" style="s2">create an author or tearing society and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.850" end="00:25:50.940" style="s2">control everyone&#39;s speech no one wants</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.650" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">to live in a society as well you have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.940" end="00:25:53.670" style="s2">make a pragmatic view you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">limited immigration you have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.670" end="00:25:58.710" style="s2">acknowledge that the dark side of human</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:26:00.120" style="s2">nature without embracing it but also you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.710" end="00:26:01.830" style="s2">know take that into account when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.120" end="00:26:03.390" style="s2">making policies yeah I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.830" end="00:26:05.370" style="s2">a really fundamental divide there which</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.390" end="00:26:08.460" style="s2">is acknowledging the darker side of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.370" end="00:26:10.800" style="s2">human nature I think we see on the on</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.460" end="00:26:13.470" style="s2">the Left people are more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.800" end="00:26:14.850" style="s2">perfecting human nature where they think</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.470" end="00:26:16.830" style="s2">that there&#39;s some sort of end goal</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.850" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">outcome where we can have a the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.830" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">human being and the way that they get</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.030" style="s2">there is by coercing all of us into this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">into this position and it also go</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.030" end="00:26:27.860" style="s2">and and if you have limited success in</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">America then that means something is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.860" end="00:26:32.390" style="s2">wrong right because everybody is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.520" style="s2">ability or at least the same in some way</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.390" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">and so if people have different outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.520" end="00:26:36.800" style="s2">and that means there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.360" end="00:26:38.420" style="s2">societally wrong then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.800" end="00:26:41.330" style="s2">continue to change it and I find on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.420" end="00:26:43.160" style="s2">right people have an acceptance of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.330" end="00:26:44.810" style="s2">darker side of human nature and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.160" end="00:26:46.100" style="s2">understand that there is good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.810" end="00:26:49.370" style="s2">in the world and there&#39;s never gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.100" end="00:26:51.860" style="s2">a way to eradicate all that from from</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.370" end="00:26:53.240" style="s2">society and so you begin to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.860" end="00:26:54.740" style="s2">yourself in the way that you can improve</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.240" end="00:26:57.050" style="s2">yourself and improve the people around</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.740" end="00:26:59.030" style="s2">you and to do the best that you can I</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.050" end="00:27:02.090" style="s2">find myself on the edge of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.030" end="00:27:04.340" style="s2">discussion in a number of ways one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.090" end="00:27:07.100" style="s2">the ways is like through sexual norms</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.340" end="00:27:08.930" style="s2">and mores and sexual practices like on</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.100" end="00:27:10.940" style="s2">to the right of me there are people that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.930" end="00:27:12.740" style="s2">will say advocate only exclusively for</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.940" end="00:27:14.180" style="s2">like you know monogamous relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.740" end="00:27:15.410" style="s2">within the context of marriage and have</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.180" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">sex solely for the act of procreation</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.410" end="00:27:19.340" style="s2">and then on the Left we have very far to</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:21.260" style="s2">the left you know hedonism and people</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.340" end="00:27:23.810" style="s2">just willy-nilly running around and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.260" end="00:27:26.210" style="s2">engaging in their most animal desires</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.810" end="00:27:27.770" style="s2">I&#39;m somewhere in the middle and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.210" end="00:27:30.770" style="s2">this tug and I&#39;ve always sort of felt</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.770" end="00:27:32.690" style="s2">the tug which is to the extent that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.770" end="00:27:34.940" style="s2">have urges as a human being whether they</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.690" end="00:27:36.740" style="s2">be tribal relationships or whether they</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.940" end="00:27:38.660" style="s2">be one smash somebody on the head or</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.740" end="00:27:40.670" style="s2">whether it is to have sex with many</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.660" end="00:27:43.070" style="s2">people as I can or whatever like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.670" end="00:27:45.170" style="s2">always been conscious of to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.070" end="00:27:47.630" style="s2">I&#39;m like exist as a human being that has</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.170" end="00:27:50.030" style="s2">urges and then my job is to sort of rein</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.630" end="00:27:52.760" style="s2">those in and I think that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.030" end="00:27:54.290" style="s2">interesting sort of battlefield and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.760" end="00:27:56.030" style="s2">I&#39;m in the middle of that and I find</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.290" end="00:27:57.920" style="s2">myself wandering through that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.030" end="00:28:00.680" style="s2">perspective in that lens both looking at</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.920" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">politics sexual practices are sexual</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.680" end="00:28:05.270" style="s2">dating and mating markets and all</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:06.950" style="s2">aspects of human life and I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.270" end="00:28:08.660" style="s2">have an answer there I just I know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.950" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">I feel the tug from both directions</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.660" end="00:28:12.740" style="s2">where I can see that our society will</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:14.540" style="s2">benefit from curtailing certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.740" end="00:28:15.980" style="s2">behaviors but I can also see how from a</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.540" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">personal perspective you can really</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.980" end="00:28:21.670" style="s2">enjoy certain things and to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:24.500" style="s2">is your personal enjoyment the foremost</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.670" end="00:28:26.360" style="s2">guiding light in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.500" end="00:28:28.760" style="s2">decision-making versus what might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.360" end="00:28:30.860" style="s2">better for society at large so you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.760" end="00:28:31.750" style="s2">this is a very fascinating battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.860" end="00:28:35.860" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.750" end="00:28:38.610" style="s2">of ideas there for me yeah and the way I</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.860" end="00:28:40.570" style="s2">look at it is you know what&#39;s publicly</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.610" end="00:28:41.860" style="s2">encouraged versus what&#39;s allowed in</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.570" end="00:28:43.780" style="s2">private I think you should allow the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.860" end="00:28:44.440" style="s2">maximum number of non harmful behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.780" end="00:28:47.020" style="s2">in private</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.440" end="00:28:48.370" style="s2">yeah so what semadar for public policy</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.020" end="00:28:49.030" style="s2">and in what&#39;s encouraged in public is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.370" end="00:28:53.800" style="s2">different matter</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.030" end="00:28:55.030" style="s2">I think if governments the government</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.800" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t clamp down a private behavior</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.030" end="00:28:58.390" style="s2">but they should encourage certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.860" end="00:29:01.000" style="s2">behaviors that are beneficial to society</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.390" end="00:29:03.670" style="s2">like though like Viktor Orban and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.000" end="00:29:05.970" style="s2">Matthias salvini in Europe are doing a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.670" end="00:29:07.990" style="s2">lot of things to encourage families and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.970" end="00:29:09.340" style="s2">procreation partly because it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.990" end="00:29:10.870" style="s2">mainly because it&#39;s very good it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.340" end="00:29:12.670" style="s2">for society then you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.870" end="00:29:15.340" style="s2">resort to mass immigration which creates</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.670" end="00:29:16.840" style="s2">all the problems we discussed earlier so</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.340" end="00:29:18.670" style="s2">I think there are certain types of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.840" end="00:29:20.830" style="s2">private habeas it&#39;s fine for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.670" end="00:29:22.180" style="s2">government to encourage I think banning</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.830" end="00:29:24.610" style="s2">private behaviors is a different matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.180" end="00:29:26.140" style="s2">right but one of the other things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.610" end="00:29:27.670" style="s2">interesting here is that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.140" end="00:29:29.170" style="s2">talking about human nature earlier and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.670" end="00:29:31.030" style="s2">the dark side of human nature and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.170" end="00:29:33.190" style="s2">good side of human nature you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.030" end="00:29:34.660" style="s2">really create good policy unless you</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.190" end="00:29:37.510" style="s2">have an understanding of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.660" end="00:29:38.740" style="s2">and we do have more understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.510" end="00:29:40.530" style="s2">human nature now than we&#39;ve ever done</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.740" end="00:29:42.430" style="s2">before thanks the cognitive revolution</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.530" end="00:29:45.270" style="s2">evolutionary psychology and all these</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.430" end="00:29:47.320" style="s2">new fields the problem is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.270" end="00:29:49.990" style="s2">research being done and the conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.320" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">being reached are so dangerous to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.990" end="00:29:55.000" style="s2">left and their ideology that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:58.360" style="s2">based on you know outdated social</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.000" end="00:29:59.530" style="s2">science in the 60s and 70s which means</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.360" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">that we can&#39;t really have an honest</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.530" end="00:30:03.400" style="s2">conversation about human age and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.230" style="s2">really harmed society in general what</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.400" end="00:30:06.220" style="s2">subjects in particular anything well</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.230" end="00:30:07.750" style="s2">you&#39;re just talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.220" end="00:30:10.510" style="s2">sexual relations that&#39;s that&#39;s some way</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.750" end="00:30:11.920" style="s2">you base need to have two studies of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.510" end="00:30:14.530" style="s2">human age you know the male and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.920" end="00:30:15.820" style="s2">female but the left won&#39;t even let you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.530" end="00:30:17.710" style="s2">have that discussion because in their</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.820" end="00:30:19.450" style="s2">view there&#39;s no such thing as innate</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.710" end="00:30:20.710" style="s2">maleness through innate female a suit on</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.450" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">you can&#39;t even develop that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.710" end="00:30:24.000" style="s2">understanding to the point where you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:25.990" style="s2">start building policy on the basis of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.000" end="00:30:27.880" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.990" end="00:30:31.960" style="s2">that&#39;s fascinating that&#39;s fascinating I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.880" end="00:30:34.180" style="s2">think that the way that I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.960" end="00:30:35.950" style="s2">where I was politically speaking is when</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.180" end="00:30:37.480" style="s2">I started to understand what was</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.950" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">happening in our dating and mating</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.480" end="00:30:42.400" style="s2">markets and the way I saw the ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:44.020" style="s2">of the left and affecting just human</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.400" end="00:30:44.770" style="s2">relationships on the ground with people</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.020" end="00:30:46.750" style="s2">in there too</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.770" end="00:30:49.630" style="s2">and whatever and this sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.750" end="00:30:52.510" style="s2">dissociation of their being maleness and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.630" end="00:30:54.520" style="s2">femaleness and the limiting factor of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.510" end="00:30:56.440" style="s2">the knob that keeping people from</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.520" end="00:30:58.030" style="s2">actually studying the differences in</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.440" end="00:31:01.720" style="s2">embracing the differences but were there</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.030" end="00:31:04.390" style="s2">any other elements of like new research</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.720" end="00:31:07.150" style="s2">and and new science that you think are</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.390" end="00:31:08.440" style="s2">gonna be inhibited by the left where you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.150" end="00:31:10.150" style="s2">know I think that people have always</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.440" end="00:31:11.710" style="s2">thought that the right was the science</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.150" end="00:31:13.870" style="s2">deniers but it seems to me that people</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.710" end="00:31:15.610" style="s2">on the left are the science deniers</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.870" end="00:31:17.550" style="s2">these days or any other subjects that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.610" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">you think are gonna be affected by that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.550" end="00:31:21.100" style="s2">I mean there are still some science</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:22.450" style="s2">denies on the Left I&#39;m sure there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.100" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">still a few people out there who believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.450" end="00:31:27.580" style="s2">in like you know the earth four thousand</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:29.470" style="s2">year shells and so on but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.580" end="00:31:31.030" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not even that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.470" end="00:31:32.770" style="s2">a harmful belief in my view because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.030" end="00:31:35.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s nowhere it&#39;s not an academia</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.770" end="00:31:37.170" style="s2">it&#39;s on the mainstream media it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.140" end="00:31:41.770" style="s2">really do much damage to society I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.170" end="00:31:43.000" style="s2">we where you have have this mentality on</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.770" end="00:31:46.060" style="s2">the Left where you have to clamp down on</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.000" end="00:31:47.680" style="s2">all this on you know studies of innate</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.060" end="00:31:49.510" style="s2">gender differences that does do damage</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.680" end="00:31:51.160" style="s2">to society because then you have money</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.510" end="00:31:53.230" style="s2">being wasted on trying to get more women</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.160" end="00:31:56.740" style="s2">into stem when actually all the research</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.230" end="00:31:57.640" style="s2">shows that it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.740" end="00:32:00.130" style="s2">difference we mail and female</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.640" end="00:32:01.660" style="s2">preferences that causes those imbalances</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.130" end="00:32:02.890" style="s2">in industries or never governments try</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.660" end="00:32:04.660" style="s2">and correct it in Scandinavia just</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.890" end="00:32:06.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work I mean it wasting tons of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.660" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">taxpayer money so you need to have that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.550" end="00:32:10.210" style="s2">honest conversation first before you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:12.700" style="s2">like start correct start correcting some</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.210" end="00:32:15.580" style="s2">of those bad policies right I&#39;m this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.700" end="00:32:15.730" style="s2">a good Segway actually actually sorry go</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.580" end="00:32:18.280" style="s2">ahead</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.730" end="00:32:19.900" style="s2">no I was gonna continue with that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.280" end="00:32:21.430" style="s2">topic about the the Scandinavian</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.900" end="00:32:24.940" style="s2">countries in the way that they&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.430" end="00:32:28.360" style="s2">to eliminate sort of structural</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.940" end="00:32:30.400" style="s2">limitations or you know social norms are</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.360" end="00:32:32.800" style="s2">browned career choices by men and women</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.400" end="00:32:34.750" style="s2">and they&#39;ve made it the most open and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.800" end="00:32:37.240" style="s2">egalitarian societies in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.750" end="00:32:40.360" style="s2">world but a funny thing happened there</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.240" end="00:32:42.850" style="s2">what happened this is like fairly well</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.360" end="00:32:46.630" style="s2">known on the right now I think what</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.850" end="00:32:49.270" style="s2">happened is that the the gender gaps and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.630" end="00:32:52.210" style="s2">industries actually started to expand</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.270" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">because when you give men and women you</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.210" end="00:32:58.060" style="s2">know as much choice as possible and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:32:58.590" style="s2">as little judgment as possible they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.060" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">just go with</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.590" end="00:33:03.900" style="s2">preferences and their own preferences</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:06.390" style="s2">are you know different right well like</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.900" end="00:33:08.460" style="s2">like what so like more more men finding</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.390" end="00:33:09.990" style="s2">themselves in Tekken and in stem and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.460" end="00:33:11.850" style="s2">more women find themselves in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.990" end="00:33:14.279" style="s2">like caretaking jobs or like school</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.850" end="00:33:16.020" style="s2">teaching or yeah essentially that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.279" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">know engineering like the gap is</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.020" end="00:33:20.789" style="s2">extremely wide even in Scandinavian</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:22.890" style="s2">countries and it just keeps on expanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.789" end="00:33:26.100" style="s2">and you actually see much lesser for gap</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.890" end="00:33:27.630" style="s2">in poorer countries in the developing</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.100" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">world because in those countries you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.630" end="00:33:31.230" style="s2">have less of a choice you go with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:33.809" style="s2">job that makes you the most money which</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.230" end="00:33:36.750" style="s2">might be you know information technology</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.809" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">it might be at the hard sciences you&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.569" end="00:39:49.309" style="s2">it&#39;s a white value to believe in logic</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.549" end="00:39:56.299" style="s2">exactly and it&#39;s terrifying to me to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.290" end="00:39:59.030" style="s2">think that a company whose job is</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.130" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">data is an inherently white supremacist</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.530" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">thing to do which is all of it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:08.900" style="s2">absolutely absurd which goes to show you</p>

<p begin="00:40:10.849" end="00:40:14.299" style="s2">emotional position but let&#39;s let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.740" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">but let&#39;s wrap up the James to more</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.630" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s been it&#39;s been interpreted a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.309" end="00:40:41.390" style="s2">different ways but the way that I read</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:44.660" style="s2">the words clear as day was that simply</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.390" end="00:40:48.440" style="s2">even discussing gender differences at</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.660" end="00:40:50.270" style="s2">work is now constitute sexual harassment</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.440" end="00:40:52.309" style="s2">and harassment is grounds for being</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.270" end="00:40:54.500" style="s2">terminated so they have basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.309" end="00:40:56.750" style="s2">normalized the practice of firing</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.500" end="00:40:59.390" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s even going to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.750" end="00:41:03.230" style="s2">something as simple as generally men are</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.390" end="00:41:06.230" style="s2">taller than women generally women get</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.230" end="00:41:08.809" style="s2">pregnant and men don&#39;t generally men</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.230" end="00:41:10.730" style="s2">take more risks than women generally men</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.809" end="00:41:12.500" style="s2">are more competitive than women just</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.730" end="00:41:14.420" style="s2">even saying anything like that is enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.500" end="00:41:16.790" style="s2">to get you fired and have the national</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.420" end="00:41:19.059" style="s2">labor review board back up the employer</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.790" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">in terminating you because that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.059" end="00:41:23.569" style="s2">harassment and that has been resolved</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:26.270" style="s2">this James the more Google memo thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.569" end="00:41:27.890" style="s2">which which blows my mind because we</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.270" end="00:41:29.720" style="s2">can&#39;t even talk about things that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.890" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">obvious this is this is what true</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.720" end="00:41:34.730" style="s2">tyranny is is we can&#39;t talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:37.130" style="s2">which are obvious to our eyes to just</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.730" end="00:41:38.690" style="s2">looking at each other this is not not I</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.130" end="00:41:39.140" style="s2">read this long story and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.690" end="00:41:40.610" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.140" end="00:41:42.860" style="s2">take on it it&#39;s not like all these</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.610" end="00:41:45.530" style="s2">flavors taste different to me no no this</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.860" end="00:41:47.990" style="s2">is like with my own observable you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.530" end="00:41:49.460" style="s2">with based on observation with my own</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.990" end="00:41:51.080" style="s2">two eyes I can see these things are true</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.460" end="00:41:53.390" style="s2">and everyone else can but they deny and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.080" end="00:41:55.910" style="s2">talking about it is now harassment I</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.390" end="00:41:57.740" style="s2">guess law constitutes getting fired yep</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.910" end="00:41:59.450" style="s2">facts don&#39;t care about your feelings but</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.740" end="00:42:02.510" style="s2">HR departments don&#39;t care about your</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.450" end="00:42:05.240" style="s2">facts that&#39;s a good that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.510" end="00:42:07.940" style="s2">right so by the way III think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.240" end="00:42:09.950" style="s2">highly unlikely that decision by the by</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.940" end="00:42:12.320" style="s2">the NLRB was an independent one because</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.950" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">my sources told me that Google was</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.320" end="00:42:16.520" style="s2">heavily lobbying the NLRB ahead of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:19.540" style="s2">and you know one of the big stories in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.520" end="00:42:21.530" style="s2">DC for the past few years has been the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.540" end="00:42:23.810" style="s2">increasing dominance of money from</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.810" end="00:42:27.470" style="s2">think I believe Google&#39;s been the top</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.250" end="00:42:29.420" style="s2">donor top political donor for a few</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.470" end="00:42:31.970" style="s2">years running now that doesn&#39;t surprise</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.420" end="00:42:33.230" style="s2">me we&#39;re gonna get to that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.970" end="00:42:34.550" style="s2">interesting they&#39;re also spreading it</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.230" end="00:42:36.500" style="s2">around a little bit in ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.550" end="00:42:37.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily think off the top</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.500" end="00:42:38.630" style="s2">of your head based on these</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.220" end="00:42:39.800" style="s2">conversations but let&#39;s continue on with</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.630" end="00:42:41.900" style="s2">the Google story you&#39;ve obviously</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.800" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">developed some good sources at Google</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.900" end="00:42:45.140" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been getting some great</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:47.060" style="s2">stories on it there what what have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.140" end="00:42:49.400" style="s2">the big stories that you have picked up</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.060" end="00:42:50.900" style="s2">on in the last 18 24 months coming out</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.400" end="00:42:52.730" style="s2">of Silicon Valley what have you seen</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.900" end="00:42:54.890" style="s2">what&#39;s been the most atrocious and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.730" end="00:42:57.740" style="s2">appalling things what&#39;s gonna scare my</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.890" end="00:42:59.870" style="s2">listeners more than anything because</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.740" end="00:43:01.460" style="s2">this stuff is terrifying and really the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.870" end="00:43:03.560" style="s2">more attention we put on it the better</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.460" end="00:43:05.570" style="s2">because this is this is our future and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.560" end="00:43:08.030" style="s2">it they&#39;re consolidating power in ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.570" end="00:43:09.140" style="s2">that we&#39;ve never seen before and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.030" end="00:43:10.970" style="s2">really important that we all know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.140" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">going on well I think the one that got</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.970" end="00:43:18.020" style="s2">the most attention just because it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:19.790" style="s2">so such like a visual reminder of</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.230" end="00:43:56.670" style="s2">got out of hand and this is all like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.380" end="00:43:58.170" style="s2">these aren&#39;t low-level employees is with</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.670" end="00:44:00.990" style="s2">the entire leadership team of Google</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.170" end="00:44:02.310" style="s2">every all the executives you can think</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.990" end="00:44:03.990" style="s2">of were up on that stage and we had the</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.990" end="00:44:07.980" style="s2">election so that got a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.180" end="00:44:09.540" style="s2">attention in the media even the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.980" end="00:44:13.170" style="s2">mainstream media admitted it was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.540" end="00:44:15.240" style="s2">scoop the one that I found most useful</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.170" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">and I think tells you the most about</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.240" end="00:44:19.320" style="s2">where Google and where other tech</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:21.600" style="s2">companies are headed is a document we</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.320" end="00:44:23.430" style="s2">obtained called the good sensor and this</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.600" end="00:44:25.500" style="s2">was an internal research document from</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.430" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">inside Google that described how the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.500" end="00:44:32.100" style="s2">company and admitted how the company had</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:34.230" style="s2">shifted toward censorship because this</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.100" end="00:44:35.850" style="s2">is not something that Google generally</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.230" end="00:44:37.470" style="s2">admits publicly but it was admitted in</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.850" end="00:44:39.480" style="s2">this internal briefing it admits that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.470" end="00:44:43.500" style="s2">Google is becoming the good sensor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.480" end="00:44:46.170" style="s2">becoming a more censored platform and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.500" end="00:44:48.570" style="s2">looks at all the reasons why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.170" end="00:44:49.560" style="s2">happening and what would what will</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.570" end="00:44:51.690" style="s2">happen if it continues in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.560" end="00:44:54.660" style="s2">one of the things it points out is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.690" end="00:44:56.250" style="s2">in order to maintain global expansion to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.660" end="00:44:58.140" style="s2">break into foreign markets it has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.250" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">continue censoring because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.140" end="00:45:06.750" style="s2">foreign governments are looking for and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">so money yeah money mainly so so what</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.750" end="00:45:10.590" style="s2">okay so first of all I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2">explain what you mean by censorship and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.590" end="00:45:15.300" style="s2">second of all please and talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.900" end="00:45:17.300" style="s2">interesting dichotomy between what</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.300" end="00:45:20.369" style="s2">appears on one hand to be a totally</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.300" end="00:45:22.440" style="s2">ideological driven policy set of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.369" end="00:45:24.150" style="s2">policies that are meant to extinguish</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.150" end="00:45:29.220" style="s2">and and ensure 50/50 you know employees</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.730" end="00:45:31.890" style="s2">across the board and every in every</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.220" end="00:45:33.840" style="s2">position you know equal this equal that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.890" end="00:45:35.670" style="s2">but then at the same time it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.840" end="00:45:37.980" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to also compromise on</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.670" end="00:45:40.500" style="s2">other ideologies and other ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.980" end="00:45:43.730" style="s2">they have other other values that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.500" end="00:45:46.020" style="s2">have in order to just you know return</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.730" end="00:45:47.970" style="s2">earnings to shareholders and drive the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.020" end="00:45:49.590" style="s2">stock price up so yeah further let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.970" end="00:45:51.630" style="s2">deal with the definition of censorship</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.590" end="00:45:53.580" style="s2">there are a lot of people especially</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.630" end="00:45:55.140" style="s2">free particle free market libertarian to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.580" end="00:45:57.540" style="s2">say that only the government can censor</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.140" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true at all in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.540" end="00:46:02.690" style="s2">modern world because you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:05.100" style="s2">go to the town square to speak anymore</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.690" end="00:46:05.880" style="s2">we use these online massive online</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.100" end="00:46:07.620" style="s2">platforms</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.880" end="00:46:09.000" style="s2">to become the new public square and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.620" end="00:46:11.700" style="s2">actually the Constitution in the First</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.000" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">Amendment does apply in in the public</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.700" end="00:46:15.810" style="s2">square we just haven&#39;t got to the point</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:18.030" style="s2">where we legally been able to legally</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.810" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">categorize these places which are public</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.030" end="00:46:23.340" style="s2">squares as public squares so in my view</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:25.980" style="s2">when google decides to delete a search</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.340" end="00:46:29.400" style="s2">results word or delete a YouTube video</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.980" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">aband someone from YouTube that is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.400" end="00:46:33.150" style="s2">active censorship because YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:34.530" style="s2">people have become the new public</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.150" end="00:46:37.260" style="s2">squares and that goes for Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.530" end="00:46:39.450" style="s2">Facebook as well yeah and they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.260" end="00:46:41.460" style="s2">Supreme Court cases in the past where</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.450" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">privately owned public squares have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.460" end="00:46:46.230" style="s2">compelled to allow certain types of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.430" style="s2">speech on First Amendment grounds you</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.230" end="00:46:49.620" style="s2">know they did it for shopping malls in</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.430" end="00:46:52.530" style="s2">the 1980s you know if you do a shopping</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.620" end="00:46:54.270" style="s2">mall then I think you need to do it for</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.530" end="00:46:56.010" style="s2">a tech giant as well because you know a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.270" end="00:46:57.810" style="s2">tech giant is a much bigger public</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.010" end="00:46:59.100" style="s2">square than a shopping mall oh right</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.810" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">because the shopping mall is private</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.100" end="00:47:01.740" style="s2">property</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:04.170" style="s2">but yet you&#39;re sort of in public and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.740" end="00:47:06.150" style="s2">they deemed like free speech was</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.170" end="00:47:08.010" style="s2">required there yeah they did they said</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.150" end="00:47:09.450" style="s2">you know political activists do you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.010" end="00:47:10.470" style="s2">the right to hand out flyers that even</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.450" end="00:47:13.320" style="s2">the shopping mall doesn&#39;t want you to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.470" end="00:47:14.940" style="s2">got it so that&#39;s that&#39;s that deals with</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.320" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">the censorship question and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.940" end="00:47:19.820" style="s2">definition in my view but what are they</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:23.610" style="s2">what are they actually doing to censor</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.820" end="00:47:27.480" style="s2">besides the ones are there right</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.610" end="00:47:29.670" style="s2">Deepti monetize the platform kick off</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.480" end="00:47:31.410" style="s2">but like what&#39;s going on behind the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.670" end="00:47:32.730" style="s2">scenes this is this is what I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.410" end="00:47:34.320" style="s2">even more worried about the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.730" end="00:47:35.250" style="s2">you can&#39;t see yeah well the scarier</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.320" end="00:47:36.990" style="s2">thing is when they adjust their</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.250" end="00:47:39.540" style="s2">algorithms and adjust search rankings</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.990" end="00:47:41.850" style="s2">and you&#39;re unable to detect what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.540" end="00:47:43.590" style="s2">actually done like I couldn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.850" end="00:47:45.300" style="s2">all the search results that Google has</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.590" end="00:47:47.340" style="s2">manipulated well that YouTube has</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.300" end="00:47:50.250" style="s2">manipulated I can tell you that some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.340" end="00:47:52.260" style="s2">them certainly have been because one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.250" end="00:47:54.990" style="s2">the throws we released I think late</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.260" end="00:47:57.150" style="s2">December January was we got our hands on</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.990" end="00:47:59.220" style="s2">a partial list of YouTube search</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.150" end="00:48:01.230" style="s2">blacklist and that&#39;s a file they keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.220" end="00:48:05.190" style="s2">with so-called controversial search</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.230" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">queries that they manually adjust so</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.190" end="00:48:09.690" style="s2">they insert a search term into this file</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.080" style="s2">and what it does is it caused another</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.690" end="00:48:13.980" style="s2">algorithm to kick in that elevates</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.080" end="00:48:16.620" style="s2">establishment new sources and the search</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.980" end="00:48:18.810" style="s2">rankings and pushes down non verified</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.620" end="00:48:19.650" style="s2">non-establishment sources so they did</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.810" end="00:48:21.240" style="s2">that for</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.650" end="00:48:24.060" style="s2">search results related to abortion and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.240" end="00:48:25.560" style="s2">abortions and the result was that lots</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.060" end="00:48:27.420" style="s2">of pro-life videos got kicked off the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.560" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">top 10 search lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.420" end="00:48:31.050" style="s2">pro-abortion videos from places like</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:33.150" style="s2">BuzzFeed and Vice went up the search</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.050" end="00:48:35.940" style="s2">results so they&#39;ve dead already doing it</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.150" end="00:48:37.650" style="s2">for our for political terms right had</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.940" end="00:48:39.900" style="s2">you&#39;ve confirmed this from sources were</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.650" end="00:48:41.670" style="s2">inside these organizations and oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.900" end="00:48:43.050" style="s2">there was in a leaked discussion thread</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.670" end="00:48:45.930" style="s2">from inside Google that was leaked to us</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.050" end="00:48:47.580" style="s2">and actually one of the employees one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.930" end="00:48:48.870" style="s2">the Google employees in that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.580" end="00:48:50.690" style="s2">group said well this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.870" end="00:48:53.340" style="s2">smoking gun this is political censorship</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.690" end="00:48:55.110" style="s2">so I did not use the word smoking gun</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.340" end="00:48:56.820" style="s2">that&#39;s Google as an employee&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.110" end="00:48:59.190" style="s2">description of what&#39;s going on here so</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.820" end="00:49:00.600" style="s2">even Google&#39;s employees can see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.190" end="00:49:01.650" style="s2">happening and see what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.600" end="00:49:04.260" style="s2">some of them were very concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.650" end="00:49:05.970" style="s2">it which is why they talked to us right</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.260" end="00:49:09.330" style="s2">and what did they what would they say</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.970" end="00:49:10.410" style="s2">was the justification behind making such</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.330" end="00:49:11.940" style="s2">adjustments like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.410" end="00:49:14.370" style="s2">well the Joseph gage was very clear in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.940" end="00:49:17.010" style="s2">that case because it actually the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.370" end="00:49:18.870" style="s2">abortion term was added just a few hours</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.010" end="00:49:21.930" style="s2">after Google was contacted by a</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.870" end="00:49:23.130" style="s2">left-wing well you know I say report it</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.930" end="00:49:25.590" style="s2">was really a left-wing activist posing</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.130" end="00:49:27.990" style="s2">as a reporter at Slate complaining about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.590" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">the prominence of pro-life videos in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.990" end="00:49:32.580" style="s2">in the search results and just a few</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:33.780" style="s2">hours after that Google adjusts its</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.580" end="00:49:36.300" style="s2">search results and pushes all those</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.780" end="00:49:38.310" style="s2">pro-life videos off their top 10 results</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.300" end="00:49:40.650" style="s2">so you can clearly see the motivation in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.310" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">that case 100 100 percent politically</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.650" end="00:49:46.770" style="s2">motivated there also other search terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:48.510" style="s2">on there like David hog the anti Second</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.770" end="00:49:51.120" style="s2">Amendment activist Maxine Waters a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.510" end="00:49:53.880" style="s2">democratic politician they&#39;re all on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.120" end="00:49:55.950" style="s2">list as well which means that you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.880" end="00:49:57.120" style="s2">see more establishment new sources pop</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.950" end="00:49:58.680" style="s2">up in your search results for those</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.120" end="00:50:00.690" style="s2">people so they&#39;re actually assisting a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.680" end="00:50:01.980" style="s2">democratic politician there right so</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.690" end="00:50:03.360" style="s2">this is one of the things that scares</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.980" end="00:50:05.880" style="s2">the out of me the most which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.360" end="00:50:07.670" style="s2">that I had to tweet the other day where</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.880" end="00:50:09.540" style="s2">I said imagine a future where</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.670" end="00:50:10.920" style="s2">intersectionality is burned into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.540" end="00:50:13.140" style="s2">algorithms that control everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.920" end="00:50:14.940" style="s2">around us and basically that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.140" end="00:50:18.120" style="s2">started to happen right I mean these</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.940" end="00:50:20.930" style="s2">algorithms are what shape so the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.120" end="00:50:23.790" style="s2">challenge that we have is filtering out</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.930" end="00:50:25.770" style="s2">information and filtering out bad</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.790" end="00:50:26.700" style="s2">information finding the right</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.770" end="00:50:28.590" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.700" end="00:50:30.360" style="s2">you know there&#39;s we just live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.590" end="00:50:32.010" style="s2">of information overload and so being</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.360" end="00:50:33.600" style="s2">able to search specifically for things</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.010" end="00:50:35.100" style="s2">that you want to find</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.600" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">important and it&#39;s a path towards the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.100" end="00:50:40.620" style="s2">truth if you&#39;re if the gatekeeper is</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:43.590" style="s2">keeping you know these things from you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.620" end="00:50:46.110" style="s2">and hiding information and hiding data</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.590" end="00:50:48.390" style="s2">from you then they&#39;re effectively sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.110" end="00:50:50.250" style="s2">of shaping our view of reality I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.390" end="00:50:52.350" style="s2">this would be like if the the library</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.250" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">maybe they did this in the past you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.350" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">they probably did you know we act like</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">today people are less trustworthy than</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:00.690" style="s2">they were before but imagine this kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">of stuff has been going on for a long</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.690" end="00:51:03.420" style="s2">time but it&#39;s like imagine you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:04.860" style="s2">library and you&#39;re like I want to learn</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.930" end="00:58:53.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole that&#39;s a garbage argument</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.200" end="00:58:55.860" style="s2">in my you this idea that free markets</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.880" end="00:58:58.560" style="s2">and all the liberal values go hand in</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.860" end="00:58:59.880" style="s2">hand it&#39;s a simple case of and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.560" end="00:59:01.140" style="s2">conservatives especially traditional</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.880" end="00:59:03.750" style="s2">conservatives need to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.140" end="00:59:06.090" style="s2">it&#39;s simply a case of incentives you</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.750" end="00:59:07.800" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve got a huge market that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.090" end="00:59:10.680" style="s2">very liberal like say you know in</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.800" end="00:59:12.570" style="s2">Pakistan and companies that want to gain</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.680" end="00:59:14.670" style="s2">access to that market will adhere to</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.570" end="00:59:16.380" style="s2">their values I mean it&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.670" end="00:59:18.810" style="s2">same way in the West I mean companies</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.380" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">never used to wear rainbow flags or you</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.810" end="00:59:22.090" style="s2">know display rainbow flags and their</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:24.370" style="s2">officers because they knew that</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.090" end="00:59:25.990" style="s2">you know Western societies hadn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.370" end="00:59:28.360" style="s2">reached that point of Tolerance yet now</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.990" end="00:59:30.370" style="s2">you know now it&#39;s a good thing that gets</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.360" end="00:59:32.350" style="s2">them you know points with trendy</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.370" end="00:59:33.220" style="s2">Millennials so they do it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.350" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">if they get into a country like Pakistan</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.220" end="00:59:37.630" style="s2">of course they won&#39;t do it so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:39.160" style="s2">case of incentives and when you have all</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.630" end="00:59:41.170" style="s2">these illiberal societies that have</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.160" end="00:59:43.330" style="s2">booming demographics that there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.170" end="00:59:44.920" style="s2">consumer markets so these companies now</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.330" end="00:59:46.870" style="s2">have an incentive to go into those</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.920" end="00:59:48.760" style="s2">societies go into those markets and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.870" end="00:59:50.850" style="s2">abandoned their values in the process</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.760" end="00:59:52.900" style="s2">and engage in censorship in the process</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.850" end="00:59:56.080" style="s2">meanwhile you have demographic decline</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.900" end="00:59:57.460" style="s2">in the West so the markets that actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.080" end="01:00:00.250" style="s2">do you believe in liberal values are</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.460" end="01:00:02.350" style="s2">declining and they&#39;re actually try the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.250" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">the trend now is to have them be be</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.350" end="01:00:07.390" style="s2">replaced by immigrant communities you</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:08.650" style="s2">know from the Middle East and these</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.390" end="01:00:10.540" style="s2">these societies that don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.650" end="01:00:12.460" style="s2">believe in liberal values at all so</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.540" end="01:00:14.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not fixing the problem either so</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.460" end="01:00:16.750" style="s2">all the incentives for these global</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.320" end="01:00:19.750" style="s2">corporations now trend away from liberal</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.750" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">values so in the free market I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.750" end="01:00:25.120" style="s2">think will on current trends lead to</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:27.820" style="s2">more more liberal values and more</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.120" end="01:00:29.110" style="s2">freedom that was argument I was making</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.820" end="01:00:30.630" style="s2">you just call it garbage I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.110" end="01:00:34.060" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.630" end="01:00:36.520" style="s2">so one of the things that I&#39;ve seen is</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.060" end="01:00:37.900" style="s2">that corporations and at least in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.520" end="01:00:40.780" style="s2">experience in the past and everything I</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.900" end="01:00:42.970" style="s2">seem to have read before when a fresh</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.780" end="01:00:45.640" style="s2">crop of graduates entered into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.970" end="01:00:48.250" style="s2">corporation the the graduates were</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.640" end="01:00:50.950" style="s2">expected to adopt the existing company</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.250" end="01:00:52.090" style="s2">culture and adopt the existing set of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.950" end="01:00:55.360" style="s2">company ideals</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.090" end="01:00:58.840" style="s2">it seems to me today that companies are</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.360" end="01:01:01.000" style="s2">responding much more quickly to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.840" end="01:01:02.800" style="s2">incoming graduate sort of ideas where</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.000" end="01:01:04.660" style="s2">they&#39;re bringing off of college campuses</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.800" end="01:01:06.910" style="s2">where they&#39;re getting this education and</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.660" end="01:01:08.290" style="s2">radical feminism intersectionality and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.910" end="01:01:12.130" style="s2">even if they&#39;re not taking courses in</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.290" end="01:01:14.770" style="s2">those areas those areas have affected</p>

<p begin="01:01:18.700" end="01:01:21.850" style="s2">of things that are outlined in my book</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.660" end="01:01:23.350" style="s2">Democrats a deplorable and all these</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.850" end="01:01:25.360" style="s2">kids are graduating and then they go</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.350" end="01:01:27.370" style="s2">into the tech world and then they start</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.360" end="01:01:28.810" style="s2">making demands of these corporations and</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.370" end="01:01:32.050" style="s2">the corporation&#39;s are responding and</p>

<p begin="01:01:32.050" end="01:01:35.110" style="s2">have you seen anything like that do</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.190" end="01:01:35.980" style="s2">people talk about that I mean I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.110" end="01:01:37.980" style="s2">like to really</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.980" end="01:01:40.390" style="s2">or this responsiveness to the corporate</p>

<p begin="01:03:16.090" end="01:03:19.270" style="s2">the West they have to give in to these</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.650" end="01:03:20.470" style="s2">radical activists who are intern</p>

<p begin="01:03:27.160" end="01:03:30.790" style="s2">like Saudi Arabia in Pakistan</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.390" end="01:03:32.710" style="s2">they are also cave in as the political</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.790" end="01:03:35.170" style="s2">cultures there which are radically</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.710" end="01:03:37.000" style="s2">different to to what social justice</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.170" end="01:03:38.859" style="s2">warriors want right so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.000" end="01:03:40.720" style="s2">unifying motivation for them it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.859" end="01:03:42.760" style="s2">profit profit profit right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.720" end="01:03:43.960" style="s2">it seems to be yeah yeah well I guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.760" end="01:03:45.250" style="s2">you can&#39;t really fault them for that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.960" end="01:03:46.510" style="s2">mean that&#39;s what they were set up for</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.250" end="01:03:47.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re chartered to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.510" end="01:03:48.750" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re actually legally</p>

<p begin="01:03:48.750" end="01:03:53.760" style="s2">so you do you think that their their</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.020" end="01:03:56.460" style="s2">behavior in the United States at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:58.170" style="s2">is in line with their fiduciary</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.460" end="01:03:59.510" style="s2">responsibilities to shareholders because</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.170" end="01:04:01.800" style="s2">I think some people would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.510" end="01:04:03.300" style="s2">companies taking on these social justice</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.800" end="01:04:04.460" style="s2">positions and whatnot are actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.300" end="01:04:06.390" style="s2">contrary to their fiduciary</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.460" end="01:04:08.220" style="s2">responsibilities do you think that this</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.390" end="01:04:09.720" style="s2">is actually in line with those</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.220" end="01:04:11.850" style="s2">responsibilities in that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.720" end="01:04:13.320" style="s2">supposed to be honor and integrity and</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.850" end="01:04:14.970" style="s2">honest and make money make money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.320" end="01:04:16.440" style="s2">the whole number number one job right</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.970" end="01:04:18.410" style="s2">well I think it&#39;s very short I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.440" end="01:04:20.550" style="s2">thinking on the one hand because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.410" end="01:04:23.010" style="s2">they don&#39;t anticipate the backlash</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.550" end="01:04:25.610" style="s2">they&#39;ll get from non progressive markets</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.010" end="01:04:29.220" style="s2">I mean this is the mistake the NFL made</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.610" end="01:04:30.480" style="s2">and certainly I think people should be</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.220" end="01:04:32.130" style="s2">fired ever what happened at the NFL</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.480" end="01:04:34.140" style="s2">because they lost an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.130" end="01:04:39.120" style="s2">money over all their political posturing</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.140" end="01:04:41.700" style="s2">and you know the the kneeling and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.120" end="01:04:43.050" style="s2">know all that stuff right I noticed the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.700" end="01:04:45.150" style="s2">kneeling is but the fact that management</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.050" end="01:04:47.730" style="s2">seemed to be encouraging it that was the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.150" end="01:04:49.380" style="s2">real issue I mean I&#39;m not I&#39;m fine with</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.730" end="01:04:51.300" style="s2">you know you couldn&#39;t kneel or make any</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.380" end="01:04:53.100" style="s2">political gesture you won&#39;t let just</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.300" end="01:04:54.180" style="s2">free speech but when the organization&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.100" end="01:04:55.320" style="s2">supporting it that&#39;s a different matter</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.180" end="01:04:58.410" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna piss off your</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.320" end="01:04:59.940" style="s2">consumers so I don&#39;t think modern</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.410" end="01:05:01.800" style="s2">corporations in the West get that</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.940" end="01:05:03.330" style="s2">because they&#39;re part of the globalist</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.800" end="01:05:05.220" style="s2">metropolitan culture and they just</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.330" end="01:05:07.590" style="s2">fundamentally don&#39;t understand middle</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.220" end="01:05:09.540" style="s2">America which is a part of their market</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.590" end="01:05:13.290" style="s2">so you&#39;re saying they&#39;re just wrong not</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.540" end="01:05:16.320" style="s2">evil yeah I think that they&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.290" end="01:05:19.050" style="s2">it wrong but also you got to place some</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.320" end="01:05:20.940" style="s2">of the blame here on Republicans because</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.050" end="01:05:21.930" style="s2">as I was saying earlier if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.940" end="01:05:24.870" style="s2">about you know fiduciary</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.930" end="01:05:26.370" style="s2">responsibilities a company CEO will</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.870" end="01:05:28.290" style="s2">think well if we have all these</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.370" end="01:05:30.120" style="s2">regulations coming in from Democrats</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.290" end="01:05:31.740" style="s2">it&#39;s going to harm our profit margins so</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.120" end="01:05:33.690" style="s2">better do what they say if the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.740" end="01:05:35.280" style="s2">Republicans were better at thinking up</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.690" end="01:05:37.620" style="s2">their own regulations their own</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.280" end="01:05:39.240" style="s2">proposals for how tech companies might</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.620" end="01:05:41.910" style="s2">be regulated if they don&#39;t adhere to</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.240" end="01:05:44.670" style="s2">Western values if they don&#39;t protect the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.910" end="01:05:46.710" style="s2">free speech of their users protect</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.670" end="01:05:48.420" style="s2">consumer rights business rights because</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.710" end="01:05:49.860" style="s2">you know if you have one of your</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.420" end="01:05:51.420" style="s2">Facebook pages banned you know if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.860" end="01:05:52.890" style="s2">spent two years or three years building</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.420" end="01:05:56.100" style="s2">it up and investing money into it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.890" end="01:05:59.340" style="s2">a huge blow to your business and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.100" end="01:06:01.320" style="s2">analogy I use is that you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.340" end="01:06:02.970" style="s2">a landlord selling you land</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.320" end="01:06:04.020" style="s2">and then not in your house down two</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.970" end="01:06:05.790" style="s2">years later without getting any</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.020" end="01:06:07.860" style="s2">compensation that would be an outrageous</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.790" end="01:06:09.750" style="s2">business practice that would fool people</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.860" end="01:06:11.190" style="s2">to be up in arms in normal circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.750" end="01:06:13.290" style="s2">but social media companies allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.190" end="01:06:15.060" style="s2">get it away without equivalent said this</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.290" end="01:06:17.340" style="s2">and I live in fear of that almost every</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.060" end="01:06:19.850" style="s2">single day honestly yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.340" end="01:06:22.230" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of ways Republicans could</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.850" end="01:06:23.880" style="s2">start talking about proposed legislation</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.230" end="01:06:26.340" style="s2">to protect consumers protect businesses</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.880" end="01:06:28.830" style="s2">protect free speech but they&#39;re not and</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.340" end="01:06:30.180" style="s2">that means that if you&#39;re a CEO and</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.830" end="01:06:31.530" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about profits and</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.180" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">regulation you&#39;re gonna be thinking more</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.530" end="01:06:36.570" style="s2">about what the Democrats want them what</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:38.550" style="s2">the Republicans want I was going through</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.570" end="01:06:39.840" style="s2">your articles preparing for this I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.550" end="01:06:41.160" style="s2">I saw one that talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.840" end="01:06:43.890" style="s2">influence of their new money in</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.160" end="01:06:45.240" style="s2">Washington DC and at first glance you</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.890" end="01:06:46.830" style="s2">might think that they would be heavily</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.240" end="01:06:47.970" style="s2">fit you know focused on the Democrats</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.830" end="01:06:49.320" style="s2">but it turns out that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.970" end="01:06:52.440" style="s2">spreading that money around a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.320" end="01:06:54.420" style="s2">isn&#39;t it right oh yeah the sundar pichai</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.440" end="01:06:56.340" style="s2">the Google CEO recently admitted that</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.420" end="01:06:58.890" style="s2">the company gave money to the National</p>

<p begin="01:07:46.620" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">ends up in power but yeah it&#39;s a normal</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.540" end="01:07:51.240" style="s2">behavior I wouldn&#39;t know most really</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:55.130" style="s2">acceptable behavior mean there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.240" end="01:07:57.210" style="s2">problem for years American politics but</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.130" end="01:07:58.680" style="s2">certainly normal behavior field</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.210" end="01:08:00.510" style="s2">corporation I think it takes a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.680" end="01:08:02.790" style="s2">significance with Google and Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.510" end="01:08:04.290" style="s2">and big tech because of the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.790" end="01:08:07.380" style="s2">influence these companies have over our</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.290" end="01:08:08.610" style="s2">lives our businesses and basically every</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.380" end="01:08:10.830" style="s2">aspect of what we do in a modern society</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.610" end="01:08:12.210" style="s2">well you mentioned the argument you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.830" end="01:08:14.070" style="s2">go build your own network</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.210" end="01:08:16.020" style="s2">or whatever go start here on this that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.070" end="01:08:17.870" style="s2">that seems to be the response you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.020" end="01:08:21.480" style="s2">saying from like typical conservative</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.870" end="01:08:23.420" style="s2">think-tanks in Washington DC but on my</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.480" end="01:08:26.670" style="s2">corner of the internet I&#39;m mostly</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.420" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">associate with conservative types none</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.670" end="01:08:30.600" style="s2">of us are saying I&#39;m saying that right</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:32.310" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re all making the public square</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.600" end="01:08:34.920" style="s2">argument and we&#39;re all making sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.310" end="01:08:37.469" style="s2">like the public utility argument what do</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.920" end="01:08:39.060" style="s2">you attribute that that divide that</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.469" end="01:08:40.920" style="s2">division I mean I&#39;ve always believed in</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.060" end="01:08:43.350" style="s2">free markets I went to George Mason</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.920" end="01:08:45.029" style="s2">University I&#39;ve got an undergrad degree</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.350" end="01:08:46.890" style="s2">in economics from among the most</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.029" end="01:08:50.790" style="s2">libertarian universities in the country</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.890" end="01:08:52.680" style="s2">and and I can always see the free market</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.790" end="01:08:55.170" style="s2">answer to the problem in many</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.680" end="01:08:56.910" style="s2">circumstances but in this one it seems</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.170" end="01:08:59.460" style="s2">to me that they have a mass so much</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.910" end="01:09:03.210" style="s2">power and have so much control and have</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.460" end="01:09:04.950" style="s2">shifted this idea of what public is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.210" end="01:09:06.690" style="s2">I can I can see that some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.950" end="01:09:09.839" style="s2">regulation would be helpful it certainly</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.690" end="01:09:11.730" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking just personally yeah would</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.839" end="01:09:13.290" style="s2">really help me if I wasn&#39;t afraid that</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.730" end="01:09:15.060" style="s2">my you know twenty five thousand</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.290" end="01:09:18.390" style="s2">follower account on Twitter wasn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.060" end="01:09:20.549" style="s2">be shut down or even worse like not</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.390" end="01:09:24.900" style="s2">being able to use PayPal or any of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.549" end="01:09:27.060" style="s2">financial transaction providers so guys</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.900" end="01:09:28.830" style="s2">like Gavin McGinnis get kicked off Alex</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.060" end="01:09:30.989" style="s2">Jones get kicked off there&#39;s the names</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.830" end="01:09:33.299" style="s2">are so there&#39;s so many names now you</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.989" end="01:09:35.250" style="s2">can&#39;t even remember all of them and</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.299" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">we&#39;re all making the argument and not</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.250" end="01:09:39.540" style="s2">not to build your own internet argument</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:40.950" style="s2">so what do you see where did that divide</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.540" end="01:09:42.690" style="s2">come from I mean these are all these are</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.950" end="01:09:43.980" style="s2">all people off sensibly conservative but</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.690" end="01:09:46.049" style="s2">they&#39;re making very very different</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.980" end="01:09:47.489" style="s2">arguments I think it in some cases the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.049" end="01:09:50.100" style="s2">generational thing because you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.489" end="01:09:52.830" style="s2">older boomer conservatives grew up in an</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.100" end="01:09:54.600" style="s2">era when the trendy thing was to support</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.830" end="01:09:55.950" style="s2">free markets and deregulation and there</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.600" end="01:09:57.930" style="s2">was a big case to made for that in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.950" end="01:09:59.550" style="s2">80s and the 70s when there was too much</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.930" end="01:10:01.170" style="s2">government you know that&#39;s when they</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.550" end="01:10:02.640" style="s2">solidified their political values and</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.170" end="01:10:05.010" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of just a knee-jerk response</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.640" end="01:10:06.989" style="s2">to oppose regulation of business for</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.010" end="01:10:10.500" style="s2">some of them the other reason is because</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.989" end="01:10:15.719" style="s2">of this you know the swamp this culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.500" end="01:10:18.719" style="s2">of corporations pouring money into DC to</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.719" end="01:10:20.100" style="s2">influence Republicans against regulation</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.719" end="01:10:21.960" style="s2">and to influence Democrats in favor of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.100" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">regulation that they want so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.960" end="01:10:25.800" style="s2">that aspect to it as well I think many</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:26.969" style="s2">of the Trump supporters</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.800" end="01:10:28.260" style="s2">don&#39;t come from that world they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.969" end="01:10:29.579" style="s2">opposed to that world which is why they</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.260" end="01:10:32.219" style="s2">supported Trump and I think that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.579" end="01:10:34.199" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that divided I think if we</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.219" end="01:10:36.809" style="s2">look like someone who sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.199" end="01:10:38.550" style="s2">personifies this new brand of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.809" end="01:10:39.809" style="s2">conservatism which is very skeptical of</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.550" end="01:10:42.179" style="s2">corporate power it would be Tucker</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.809" end="01:10:43.829" style="s2">Carlson we&#39;re sort of you got more like</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.179" end="01:10:45.179" style="s2">ben shapiro and charlie kirk</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.829" end="01:10:46.320" style="s2">representing the older school of</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.179" end="01:10:49.739" style="s2">conservative thought where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.320" end="01:10:51.570" style="s2">regulate corporations at all right so</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.739" end="01:10:53.730" style="s2">between the Democrats and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.570" end="01:10:56.429" style="s2">Republicans somebody like me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.730" end="01:10:58.079" style="s2">interested in free speech online but you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.429" end="01:10:59.400" style="s2">know I just add to that I think we are</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.079" end="01:11:01.590" style="s2">winning the argument cuz I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.400" end="01:11:03.599" style="s2">hearing from those people you know more</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.590" end="01:11:05.849" style="s2">and more talk in favor of regulation in</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.599" end="01:11:08.699" style="s2">favor of taking a look at the power of</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.849" end="01:11:10.199" style="s2">these companies so I&#39;ve I think the Pro</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.699" end="01:11:12.449" style="s2">regulation side is winning the argument</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.199" end="01:11:15.119" style="s2">slowly despite all the money that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.449" end="01:11:16.619" style="s2">Google&#39;s plowing into a DC Pro</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.119" end="01:11:18.119" style="s2">regulation but then there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.619" end="01:11:19.770" style="s2">like multiple different flavors of</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.119" end="01:11:21.420" style="s2">regulation right also like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.770" end="01:11:23.219" style="s2">Democratic flavor of regulation would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.420" end="01:11:25.469" style="s2">different than a Republican flavor or a</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.219" end="01:11:28.469" style="s2">populist flavor or Karlsson we&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.469" end="01:11:30.510" style="s2">it the Carlson flavor of regulation you</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.469" end="01:11:33.840" style="s2">know the the Democrats aren&#39;t gonna like</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.510" end="01:11:36.090" style="s2">regulate Twitter to save me are they no</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.840" end="01:11:38.250" style="s2">no they&#39;re not they&#39;d be regulating it</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.090" end="01:11:40.920" style="s2">stop fake news which obviously in their</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.250" end="01:11:44.280" style="s2">in their view means conservatives and</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.920" end="01:11:45.690" style="s2">Trump supporters that would probably</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.280" end="01:11:47.790" style="s2">raise constitutional questions but</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.690" end="01:11:49.199" style="s2">they&#39;re it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.790" end="01:11:51.809" style="s2">complicated game they&#39;re playing because</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.199" end="01:11:53.369" style="s2">they&#39;d be willing to impose other kinds</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.809" end="01:11:55.139" style="s2">of regulations say to protect privacy</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.369" end="01:11:57.809" style="s2">which be a good thing but they&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.139" end="01:11:59.099" style="s2">say well that also be talking to these</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.809" end="01:12:01.380" style="s2">companies and we know that Chuck Schumer</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.099" end="01:12:03.420" style="s2">talks very closely with with Facebook we</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.380" end="01:12:05.730" style="s2">know that Obama and Zuckerberg a big</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.420" end="01:12:07.980" style="s2">pals that also be pressuring these</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.730" end="01:12:10.440" style="s2">companies to voluntarily since the Trump</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.980" end="01:12:11.849" style="s2">movement more I think all that face even</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.440" end="01:12:14.250" style="s2">more regulations on on other matters</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.849" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">right and in the kind of regulation we</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.250" end="01:12:20.369" style="s2">want is more clarifications on what a</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:21.809" style="s2">platform is versus a publisher and what</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.369" end="01:12:24.030" style="s2">a platform&#39;s allowed to do versus a</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.809" end="01:12:25.889" style="s2">publisher because the big issue we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.030" end="01:12:27.389" style="s2">seeing is platforms claiming the rights</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.889" end="01:12:30.750" style="s2">of publishers to kick off anyone they</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.389" end="01:12:32.550" style="s2">want to edit and manipulate their pages</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.750" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">however they want but also claiming the</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.550" end="01:12:37.409" style="s2">legal immunities of platforms which I</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:39.420" style="s2">meant to be neutral just a place where</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.409" end="01:12:39.800" style="s2">everyone can go and talk right so if</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.420" end="01:12:41.900" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.800" end="01:12:44.869" style="s2">decide what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not then</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.900" end="01:12:46.699" style="s2">then they also need to assume the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.869" end="01:12:48.079" style="s2">responsibility of deciding what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.699" end="01:12:50.510" style="s2">and what&#39;s not right I mean they should</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.079" end="01:12:52.369" style="s2">either just step back and let the yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.510" end="01:12:54.079" style="s2">marketplace of ideas take care of itself</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.369" end="01:12:55.369" style="s2">or they have to be responsible for all</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.079" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">the content on their platform right</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.369" end="01:12:59.750" style="s2">exactly and they increasingly are</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:03.500" style="s2">assuming at least moral responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.750" end="01:13:05.239" style="s2">for corners on their platforms but not</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.500" end="01:13:06.530" style="s2">legal responsibility and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.239" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">the real issue they&#39;re behaving like</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.530" end="01:13:09.590" style="s2">publishers but they have the legal</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:11.119" style="s2">immunities of platforms right and this</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.590" end="01:13:12.590" style="s2">is only getting worse and it&#39;s spreading</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.119" end="01:13:14.059" style="s2">to I mean we had Tim Cook a couple</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.590" end="01:13:16.190" style="s2">months ago come out and basically say</p>

<p begin="01:16:50.309" end="01:16:55.050" style="s2">well I think the trend now will be</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.859" end="01:16:57.149" style="s2">towards more global tyranny more of</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.149" end="01:17:00.419" style="s2">governments I think the only thing that</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.399" end="01:17:02.790" style="s2">will stop that is if we see more</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.240" end="01:17:15.990" style="s2">possible to stop these companies doing</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.680" end="01:17:18.120" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing but if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.990" end="01:17:19.530" style="s2">fix the censorship issue there&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:17:21.630" end="01:17:24.810" style="s2">only thing you can do is you know raise</p>

<p begin="01:17:44.340" end="01:17:48.240" style="s2">criticisms that I have a Donald Trump so</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.260" end="01:17:50.640" style="s2">far is his lack of attention to this</p>

<p begin="01:18:01.500" end="01:18:06.060" style="s2">that he has not tackled this issue</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.150" end="01:18:07.770" style="s2">head-on and come to the defense of the</p>

<p begin="01:18:07.770" end="01:18:12.150" style="s2">helped propel him into an election and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.810" end="01:18:15.030" style="s2">think that that sentiment is spreading</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.150" end="01:18:17.010" style="s2">amongst the Mogga community especially</p>

<p begin="01:18:45.300" end="01:18:50.910" style="s2">with that but yet the tech censorship he</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.200" end="01:18:52.980" style="s2">could be doing a lot more he has spoken</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.910" end="01:18:54.690" style="s2">about it he has raised awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.980" end="01:18:56.280" style="s2">Brad Pascal his campaign manager talked</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.690" end="01:18:58.650" style="s2">about this a lot he seems to understand</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.280" end="01:19:00.540" style="s2">the issue but you know I mean just a few</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.650" end="01:19:03.690" style="s2">days ago we had Donald Trump&#39;s own son</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.540" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">Trump jr. getting a post blocked on</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.690" end="01:19:06.810" style="s2">Instagram and then Instagram going back</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:07.890" style="s2">and saying well it was a mistake I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.810" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">sorry about it but it was happening to</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.890" end="01:19:14.760" style="s2">the president&#39;s own son so it needs to</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.760" end="01:19:15.950" style="s2">be more than words at this point and in</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.760" end="01:19:18.860" style="s2">the case of USMC</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.950" end="01:19:20.540" style="s2">the new trade deal it actually was</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.860" end="01:19:22.760" style="s2">making tech censorship worse because it</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.540" end="01:19:25.400" style="s2">gives them even more legal immunities or</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.760" end="01:19:26.840" style="s2">more ability to claim those but you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.400" end="01:19:28.100" style="s2">at the same time Trump is surrounded by</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.840" end="01:19:30.140" style="s2">people in the White House who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.100" end="01:19:34.220" style="s2">believe in his vision who are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.140" end="01:19:35.900" style="s2">like hidden agents for globalism and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.220" end="01:19:36.650" style="s2">know especially you know Jared and</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.900" end="01:19:39.620" style="s2">Ivanka you know they&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.650" end="01:19:40.910" style="s2">liberals so you know it&#39;s kind of hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.620" end="01:19:43.760" style="s2">for one man to come up with all these</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.910" end="01:19:46.070" style="s2">policies by himself when so many of his</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.760" end="01:19:48.380" style="s2">own advisers the kind of work secretly</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.070" end="01:19:51.350" style="s2">working against his agenda so you gotta</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.380" end="01:19:53.420" style="s2">take that into account as well but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.350" end="01:19:56.450" style="s2">certainly think this is a way bigger</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.420" end="01:19:57.860" style="s2">issue than say CNN bias and it needs to</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.450" end="01:19:58.970" style="s2">be a priority for the Trump</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.860" end="01:20:00.410" style="s2">administration and they need to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.970" end="01:20:03.080" style="s2">thinking of policies and executive</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.410" end="01:20:05.210" style="s2">orders and ways in which they can fix</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.080" end="01:20:07.160" style="s2">the problem right I agree 100%</p>
