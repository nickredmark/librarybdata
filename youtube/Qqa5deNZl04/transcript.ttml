<p begin="00:00:08.019" end="00:00:20.060" style="s2">my sense is that there is a almost a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.290" end="00:00:23.390" style="s2">certain solidifying of a level like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.060" end="00:00:26.539" style="s2">developmental level of collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.390" end="00:00:30.650" style="s2">sense making like the the awareness or</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.539" end="00:00:32.809" style="s2">the noticing of the but I call it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.650" end="00:00:34.039" style="s2">the incapacity or the limitations the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.809" end="00:00:35.660" style="s2">horns should have to do as charitable</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.039" end="00:00:40.040" style="s2">the incompetence of the official</p>

<p begin="00:00:40.040" end="00:00:44.540" style="s2">leave a sense of demoralization but</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.680" end="00:00:46.670" style="s2">actually I think created a song stronger</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.540" end="00:00:48.950" style="s2">sense of discernment and agency towards</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.670" end="00:00:51.110" style="s2">the reality of the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.950" end="00:00:52.820" style="s2">finding alternative methods of finding</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.110" end="00:00:55.700" style="s2">out what is in fact going on what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.820" end="00:00:57.800" style="s2">true and what is effective and that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.700" end="00:01:01.100" style="s2">that has I think begun to settle like</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.800" end="00:01:03.350" style="s2">I&#39;m noticing more people almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.100" end="00:01:05.659" style="s2">feeling of a groundedness around oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.350" end="00:01:08.090" style="s2">this is what to do now what to do now is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.659" end="00:01:10.280" style="s2">actually to begin the process of finding</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.090" end="00:01:11.900" style="s2">out what is more real or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.280" end="00:01:14.299" style="s2">higher degree of confidence for myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.900" end="00:01:15.920" style="s2">what it&#39;s really the case by engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.299" end="00:01:18.229" style="s2">a seeking activity in a much broader</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.920" end="00:01:20.090" style="s2">field than just turning onto one</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.229" end="00:01:25.939" style="s2">particular channel or some small number</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.090" end="00:01:29.060" style="s2">of channels and listening more more</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.060" end="00:01:34.939" style="s2">gleaning on their own on our own that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.210" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">for sure and also I&#39;ve noticed a broader</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.939" end="00:01:38.990" style="s2">how do I say this a broader sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:41.509" style="s2">reality that this is actually isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.990" end="00:01:44.030" style="s2">as much a possibility as it is a threat</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.509" end="00:01:46.549" style="s2">like I&#39;ve noticed a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.030" end="00:01:50.090" style="s2">consciousness about the okay what do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.549" end="00:01:51.670" style="s2">do like this is a remarkable change in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.090" end="00:01:54.020" style="s2">the possibility space</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.670" end="00:01:55.790" style="s2">what are we do in that context right not</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.020" end="00:01:57.350" style="s2">a sitting back and reacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.790" end="00:01:59.270" style="s2">okay what do I do to take care of myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.350" end="00:02:01.790" style="s2">or protect myself but now more of okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.270" end="00:02:04.220" style="s2">what do we do so I would say that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.790" end="00:02:06.009" style="s2">at the very very broad brush levels the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.220" end="00:02:09.229" style="s2">sensitivity and Sensibility that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.009" end="00:02:10.489" style="s2">have some awareness of I can go on</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.229" end="00:02:13.080" style="s2">forever on that direction by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.489" end="00:02:15.420" style="s2">could disclose really really great</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.080" end="00:02:17.670" style="s2">resonates with a lot of the sharing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:19.250" style="s2">our particular group people feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.670" end="00:02:21.810" style="s2">actually quite energized and quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.250" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">almost excited by the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.810" end="00:02:29.130" style="s2">what&#39;s happening so I&#39;d like to invite</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:31.830" style="s2">yang a man in China to begin as you were</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.130" end="00:02:33.600" style="s2">the first question on the list the high</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.830" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">journey and the question that I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.600" end="00:02:38.310" style="s2">down was what would it take for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:40.950" style="s2">Chinese game a system to successfully</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.310" end="00:02:42.630" style="s2">hijack the Internet and the social of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.950" end="00:02:45.060" style="s2">self organizing social collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.630" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">intelligences in our dystopian future</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.060" end="00:02:50.100" style="s2">and to explain where this question is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">coming from the first place is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.100" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">coming from Jordan your conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">with BJ can bail on the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:02:59.610" style="s2">Explorer podcast which I do recommend</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">everyone to take a look and you said at</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.610" end="00:03:03.330" style="s2">the time that you really saw this</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">through that there&#39;s a 95% chance that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.330" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">the China strategy of trying to use big</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:10.740" style="s2">data and the algorithms to enforce</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:12.240" style="s2">control would not work but then BJ said</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.740" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">that you know but if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.240" end="00:03:17.489" style="s2">the 5% is going to be a real bitch and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:21.750" style="s2">some TV I&#39;m sure you can call me a five</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.489" end="00:03:24.450" style="s2">percenter the second reason is because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.750" end="00:03:26.790" style="s2">felt like the government here really</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.450" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">capitalized on the perceived success of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.790" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">our you know response to coronavirus and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">even I mean like including my parents</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:36.090" style="s2">who have never been fan of the system</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:38.010" style="s2">are feeling like a sense of pride so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">like on the other one and irax you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.010" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">resonate with the pride but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:43.070" style="s2">hand I feel cautious about it because</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">you know it might be like oh really</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.070" end="00:03:48.209" style="s2">hideous I don&#39;t know whatever that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:50.760" style="s2">you know actually making us using our</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.209" end="00:03:52.739" style="s2">sort of adaptive evolutionary tribal</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.760" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">instincts to I don&#39;t know whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.739" end="00:03:58.530" style="s2">also lastly just to make sure that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:04.800" style="s2">know I say that I&#39;m not a secret agent</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.530" end="00:04:06.209" style="s2">from the Chinese government well the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.800" end="00:04:07.709" style="s2">first thing that pops up for me is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.209" end="00:04:08.790" style="s2">always noticed a pretty good heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.709" end="00:04:10.410" style="s2">that if you&#39;re feeling pride in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.790" end="00:04:11.910" style="s2">something over which you actually had no</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.410" end="00:04:14.549" style="s2">responsibility you&#39;re probably being</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.910" end="00:04:17.100" style="s2">suckered you know if if your team wins</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.549" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">the Super Bowl and you feel pride I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.100" end="00:04:20.419" style="s2">guarantee you you had nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">it and so that&#39;s actually a very useful</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.419" end="00:04:24.120" style="s2">channel for you for yanking you around</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:25.800" style="s2">if you feel pride in something that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.120" end="00:04:26.910" style="s2">actually put specific work into</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.800" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">individually and your wrist</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.910" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">sibility took a lot of that you took a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">lot of risk yourself that&#39;s what prides</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">for right so it&#39;s an interesting jacking</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">of the underlying system well you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.020" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">one of the things that I noticed I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:41.640" style="s2">three days ago blew me away I saw it on</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:43.920" style="s2">Twitter it was this conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.640" end="00:04:47.400" style="s2">a young I think probably Taiwanese</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.920" end="00:04:50.640" style="s2">willing but I&#39;m not quite sure and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.400" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">guys in charge of the whu-oh and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.640" end="00:04:53.310" style="s2">know she kept asking questions about</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">just you know my can you give me any</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.310" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">perspective from the point of view of oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:58.890" style="s2">no CDC no no WJ so the perspective to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:00.630" style="s2">a chair you know who&#39;s done well bubbly</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.890" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">blonde she&#39;s like oh how was Taiwan done</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.630" end="00:05:05.160" style="s2">and the guy just dodged the question and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">then she you know she asked him again a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.160" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">slightly different way dodged the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:10.050" style="s2">question so he gets got to realize oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:11.610" style="s2"> this guy&#39;s actually committed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.050" end="00:05:13.650" style="s2">one China policy where there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.610" end="00:05:16.140" style="s2">you can&#39;t use the phrase Taiwan full</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.650" end="00:05:17.730" style="s2">stop alright that&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.140" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">insight because it&#39;s not obvious the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.730" end="00:05:20.910" style="s2">whu-oh should have that as their</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">operating parameters which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.910" end="00:05:25.590" style="s2">that game a China has definitely done</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:27.420" style="s2">some serious work and making sure that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.590" end="00:05:28.860" style="s2">their particular preferences are</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.420" end="00:05:30.650" style="s2">influencing the wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.860" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">different institutions on a global basis</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.650" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong intent good planning</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:36.840" style="s2">pushing hard they will definitely have</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:41.310" style="s2">that so if you look at it from the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.840" end="00:05:42.690" style="s2">of view of game a game eight interfaces</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.310" end="00:05:44.520" style="s2">I think will actually tend to be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.690" end="00:05:46.710" style="s2">strong and to be perfectly frank I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.520" end="00:05:49.410" style="s2">game eight China has a significant</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.710" end="00:05:52.620" style="s2">bandage on that interface so if you look</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.410" end="00:05:54.210" style="s2">at situations where we those of us in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.620" end="00:06:02.390" style="s2">all places who choose not to find</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.210" end="00:06:04.290" style="s2">ourselves are sense-making bent by</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.390" end="00:06:06.030" style="s2">perspectives and bias that are not in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.290" end="00:06:07.350" style="s2">fact in our best interest let&#39;s just put</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.030" end="00:06:11.880" style="s2">it that way regardless of where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.350" end="00:06:14.460" style="s2">from true degree to which we are finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.880" end="00:06:16.590" style="s2">ourselves dependent on game a channels</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:32.169" style="s2">it&#39;s good to keep them relatively</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.470" end="00:07:39.090" style="s2">concise and then we can expand if we get</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.349" end="00:07:48.460" style="s2">in many ways but I kind of find it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.530" end="00:07:51.250" style="s2">overwhelming to see to come across the</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.979" end="00:07:58.330" style="s2">I find it hard to know what to do in the</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.990" end="00:08:13.389" style="s2">just I was wondering if you could offer</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.940" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">any guidance for because it can seem</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.389" end="00:08:17.500" style="s2">quite overwhelming and also urgent they</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:20.440" style="s2">kind of all the different threats that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.500" end="00:08:23.139" style="s2">are going on that you guys talk about so</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.440" end="00:08:28.090" style="s2">I was just kind of an open question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.139" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">I can okay yeah okay so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.090" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">that we now are in a circumstance for</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:33.250" style="s2">some of the things that I have not been</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:34.659" style="s2">able to articulate effectively in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.250" end="00:08:36.760" style="s2">past can be articulated much more</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.659" end="00:08:40.870" style="s2">effectively and that has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.760" end="00:08:42.909" style="s2">fact that change is strictly nonlinear</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.870" end="00:08:44.440" style="s2">there there are small amounts of change</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.909" end="00:08:45.730" style="s2">that happen during ordinary times and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.440" end="00:08:47.860" style="s2">large amounts of change that happened</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.730" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">during extraordinary times</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.860" end="00:08:52.269" style="s2">I personally I&#39;d like to use the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:53.589" style="s2">Chronos Kairos distinction because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.269" end="00:08:55.990" style="s2">feel like it&#39;s a very rich mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.589" end="00:08:57.970" style="s2">way of talking about it so in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.990" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">the the appropriate movement is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:02.890" style="s2">movement of preparation and then surge</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.529" end="00:09:10.120" style="s2">need to be engaging in upgrading your</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.040" end="00:09:28.750" style="s2">wars upon you Kairos is the time to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.589" end="00:09:30.670" style="s2">actually use those resources and move</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.750" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">and make aggressive movements into the</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:37.720" style="s2">put together the inverse is an exercise</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.529" end="00:09:38.050" style="s2">in either wasted resources or magical</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.720" end="00:09:40.329" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.050" end="00:09:42.339" style="s2">many many people endeavor to exercise</p>

<p begin="00:09:42.339" end="00:09:45.700" style="s2">they can get very frustrated because</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:47.829" style="s2">they want to make big change they see</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.700" end="00:09:49.779" style="s2">the big change needs to happen and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.829" end="00:09:51.550" style="s2">try very very hard to push that big</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.779" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">heavy boulder up the side of the cliff</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.550" end="00:09:55.510" style="s2">but it&#39;s a very inefficient effort and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:57.640" style="s2">sometimes you must do it sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.510" end="00:09:58.839" style="s2">have to do in which case you know I hope</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.640" end="00:10:00.190" style="s2">that you&#39;re successful but broadly</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.839" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">speaking you&#39;ll be crushed into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.190" end="00:10:06.010" style="s2">effort and therefore it&#39;s not a model of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">saying only do the work right no it&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.010" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">the work because the moment will come</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:12.250" style="s2">and when the moment comes then act does</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">that make sense mm-hmm the moment has</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.250" end="00:10:16.089" style="s2">come so now it&#39;s time to say oK you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.200" end="00:11:24.010" style="s2">now from that point start looking around</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.180" end="00:11:25.690" style="s2">for those people gather them around you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.010" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">among them begin to discover what is</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.480" end="00:11:34.960" style="s2">you can be figuring out things that are</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.540" end="00:11:48.100" style="s2">but I noticed that there was a period of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.130" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">time where everybody kind of had to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.100" end="00:11:53.380" style="s2">unstuck themselves from complacency and</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.920" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">speaking that&#39;s kind of a tactical</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.380" end="00:12:44.530" style="s2">actually step back from the things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.910" end="00:12:46.180" style="s2">are going on and look around either</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.530" end="00:12:47.830" style="s2">because that&#39;s your position in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.180" end="00:12:49.210" style="s2">environment or because it&#39;s your natural</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.500" end="00:12:53.830" style="s2">that need to be asked in the context</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.300" end="00:12:55.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re in how do I ask these</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.830" end="00:12:56.950" style="s2">questions and how do I come to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.480" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">context where I can actually begin to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.950" end="00:13:00.550" style="s2">answer these questions in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:02.920" style="s2">appropriate to the scope of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.550" end="00:13:05.830" style="s2">dealing with I can go and did more</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.920" end="00:13:07.780" style="s2">detail Matt if you like again I think we</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.830" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">should come back to it I think one one</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.780" end="00:13:14.140" style="s2">thing that people might want to ask is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:15.180" style="s2">does that apply to women as well or</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.140" end="00:13:17.490" style="s2">what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.180" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m not a woman I hope I hope</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.490" end="00:13:21.540" style="s2">I hope there&#39;s a good answer that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:24.450" style="s2">question that could be a good inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.540" end="00:13:26.370" style="s2">what&#39;s the similar thing for for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.450" end="00:13:28.500" style="s2">questions that the woman might want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.370" end="00:13:29.970" style="s2">ask right now cuz I think I I expected</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.500" end="00:13:32.100" style="s2">that is an extraordinary power flow</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.970" end="00:13:33.840" style="s2">inquiry and once it is fully discovered</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.100" end="00:13:37.530" style="s2">things will change meaningfully for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.840" end="00:13:39.630" style="s2">better hmm okay that&#39;s a toss we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.430" end="00:14:01.350" style="s2">really interesting is that the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.320" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">I asked got answered and I asked a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.350" end="00:14:06.530" style="s2">question about getting young people</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:08.970" style="s2">involved because I&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.530" end="00:14:11.790" style="s2">Agent centricity and you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.970" end="00:14:15.330" style="s2">about collective sense trust based sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.790" end="00:14:20.700" style="s2">making and currencies and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.330" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">create new forms of in better better</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.700" end="00:14:24.870" style="s2">information for us to create our</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:26.490" style="s2">networks of sets making on a canoeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.870" end="00:14:28.380" style="s2">that on sort of a larger scale and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.490" end="00:14:30.630" style="s2">can&#39;t seem to talk to my kids about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.380" end="00:14:32.340" style="s2">and they&#39;re older they&#39;re 19 20 and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.630" end="00:14:34.580" style="s2">those are the ones that we want to build</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.340" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">the future and it&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.580" end="00:14:38.640" style="s2">frustrating I feel like the level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">brainwashing of people and the level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.640" end="00:14:42.270" style="s2">people who you know the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:46.170" style="s2">who like yeah after this is over it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.270" end="00:14:48.780" style="s2">just gonna go back to normal it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.170" end="00:14:52.080" style="s2">kind of yeah I find it very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.780" end="00:14:53.460" style="s2">speak to that um so and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.080" end="00:14:54.870" style="s2">a question other people have but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.460" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">just gonna add that the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.870" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">universe answered my question was</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">somebody else came to me with a group of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:03.690" style="s2">teens asking me to teach them and have</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:05.630" style="s2">them help formulate some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.690" end="00:15:07.980" style="s2">so actually the university answered me</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.630" end="00:15:10.950" style="s2">but I still think we have that question</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.980" end="00:15:12.750" style="s2">like how do we talk to people about we</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.950" end="00:15:15.030" style="s2">don&#39;t actually want it to go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.750" end="00:15:16.290" style="s2">way it was all right so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.030" end="00:15:20.040" style="s2">comes up for me and I&#39;m just imagining</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.290" end="00:15:22.370" style="s2">my own teenage daughters so I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.040" end="00:15:24.360" style="s2">very first-person experience on this run</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.370" end="00:15:25.470" style="s2">what I would say and this is by the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.360" end="00:15:27.180" style="s2">in general you know I&#39;ve said this</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.470" end="00:15:28.740" style="s2">mantra a couple of times that the that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.180" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">game be which can&#39;t be spoken is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.740" end="00:15:31.030" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:32.530" style="s2">so this should not be a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.030" end="00:15:33.790" style="s2">exercise one should not talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.530" end="00:15:36.280" style="s2">but rather one should do it in an</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.790" end="00:15:37.870" style="s2">invitation to do it in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.280" end="00:15:41.020" style="s2">young people here in my mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.870" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">thinking about you know 15 to 19 not 22</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.020" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">or 25 or 35 as the case may be</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:51.300" style="s2">it is kind of really getting into their</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:54.130" style="s2">zone of proximal development</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.300" end="00:15:55.900" style="s2">look what&#39;s one step they can take in</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.130" end="00:15:58.360" style="s2">the direction of increasing empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.900" end="00:16:00.250" style="s2">in this kind of an environment which</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.360" end="00:16:02.170" style="s2">what&#39;s one little thing that they can do</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.250" end="00:16:03.460" style="s2">with their own their own embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.170" end="00:16:04.630" style="s2">their own practice the things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.460" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">doing I&#39;ll give you a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.630" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">example I&#39;ve actually begun to notice it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:12.400" style="s2">so we can think about acceleration up</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:15.100" style="s2">until two days ago my daughters were</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.400" end="00:16:17.800" style="s2">doing we&#39;re very passive</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.100" end="00:16:21.910" style="s2">watching Netflix playing Minecraft</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.800" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">things like that and then I noticed two</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.910" end="00:16:26.710" style="s2">days ago a little shift into a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:29.020" style="s2">bit more creativity a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.710" end="00:16:32.470" style="s2">agency a little bit more than figuring</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.020" end="00:16:34.330" style="s2">stuff out one was playing distributed</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.470" end="00:16:35.950" style="s2">cards against humanity&#39; and so they</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.330" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">figured out a whole new thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.950" end="00:16:38.890" style="s2">could do you know it doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:41.110" style="s2">massive but that&#39;s actually a build</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.890" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">developmental step not just taking a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.110" end="00:16:44.770" style="s2">spoon-fed piece of stuff but they just</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:46.630" style="s2">plug into but actually on their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.770" end="00:16:47.800" style="s2">figuring out some new thing that in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.630" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">context they could take ownership</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.800" end="00:16:51.700" style="s2">responsibility for they invented</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:53.620" style="s2">something new now somebody else may have</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.700" end="00:16:54.610" style="s2">invented it but the point is it was new</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.620" end="00:16:57.550" style="s2">and it was invented and they had</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.610" end="00:16:58.600" style="s2">absorbed it and began doing it what was</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.550" end="00:17:02.170" style="s2">the other one there was another one that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.600" end="00:17:03.760" style="s2">that was rather interesting again that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.170" end="00:17:05.020" style="s2">the basic structure of it is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.760" end="00:17:06.550" style="s2">a it was lightweight</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.020" end="00:17:07.570" style="s2">it was not heavy I was not asking them</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.550" end="00:17:09.100" style="s2">to figure out how to solve big problems</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.570" end="00:17:10.390" style="s2">asking them to do the thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.100" end="00:17:12.130" style="s2">want to do which is to actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.390" end="00:17:12.790" style="s2">life to feel like adolescents to feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.130" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">like they&#39;re hanging out with their</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.790" end="00:17:19.030" style="s2">friends and doing fun teenager things</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">but not plugged into the matrix that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.030" end="00:17:24.850" style="s2">plugged into the menu of prefab things</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:26.950" style="s2">that you can do but rather actually for</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.850" end="00:17:29.140" style="s2">the first time staking out and beginning</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.950" end="00:17:31.450" style="s2">to take their own capacities and realize</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.140" end="00:17:32.680" style="s2">oh I can do this and not having right</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.450" end="00:17:33.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not naming it&#39;s not saying hey you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.680" end="00:17:35.830" style="s2">could do this you have this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.820" end="00:17:37.660" style="s2">rather just to get our single step</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.830" end="00:17:39.850" style="s2">actually do it don&#39;t try to theorize</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.660" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">that don&#39;t try to make the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.850" end="00:17:43.900" style="s2">don&#39;t help us do this don&#39;t make it so</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.900" end="00:17:47.140" style="s2">about what they&#39;re doing just get them</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">to a place where they&#39;re doing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.140" end="00:17:51.340" style="s2">and then as they get better at doing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:52.660" style="s2">it starts to settle in then see if</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.340" end="00:17:53.950" style="s2">there&#39;s that moment of Epiphany where</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.660" end="00:17:56.110" style="s2">you can sort of see that they themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.950" end="00:17:57.910" style="s2">become conscious of oh that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.110" end="00:17:59.800" style="s2">we can&#39;t invent these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.910" end="00:18:04.180" style="s2">and this is a lot more fun it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.800" end="00:18:07.090" style="s2">more interesting in this place in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.180" end="00:18:09.160" style="s2">case in this stage the development of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.090" end="00:18:10.750" style="s2">that capacity in their bodies and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.160" end="00:18:12.360" style="s2">if there is a single epiphany of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.750" end="00:18:15.550" style="s2">consciousness raising about that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.360" end="00:18:19.640" style="s2">worth 10,000 steps for everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.550" end="00:18:31.830" style="s2">you guys it&#39;s very high leverage right</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.640" end="00:18:33.390" style="s2">great so Dan Gagan so I&#39;ll just write</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.830" end="00:18:35.070" style="s2">the question to quit you from the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.390" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">session I don&#39;t really care that much</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.070" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">about how the Federal Reserve works</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:42.690" style="s2">because it&#39;s going away really quick so</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:44.550" style="s2">that&#39;s true who or what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.690" end="00:18:46.110" style="s2">replace things like that not</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.550" end="00:18:49.950" style="s2">specifically the Federal Reserve but</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.110" end="00:18:51.510" style="s2">think of it in the abstract like things</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.950" end="00:18:54.090" style="s2">like that there&#39;s sort of systems boys</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.510" end="00:18:55.290" style="s2">gonna replace them and you know groups</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.090" end="00:19:01.410" style="s2">that are actually working on those</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.290" end="00:19:02.940" style="s2">problems specifically well we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.410" end="00:19:07.800" style="s2">about that thinking maybe two languages</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.940" end="00:19:14.310" style="s2">so I&#39;ll talk about it in mmm this way to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.800" end="00:19:16.290" style="s2">put this shenanigans all right there we</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.310" end="00:19:17.820" style="s2">go so there&#39;s one approach the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.290" end="00:19:19.680" style="s2">college turn an against there lots of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.820" end="00:19:22.230" style="s2">shenanigans going on that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.680" end="00:19:24.690" style="s2">answer to the question those are folks</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.230" end="00:19:25.890" style="s2">who are in positions of power folks in</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.690" end="00:19:27.090" style="s2">positions of power looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.890" end="00:19:30.030" style="s2">current Federal Reserve structure and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.090" end="00:19:31.770" style="s2">going awesome this looks fantastic I see</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.030" end="00:19:33.930" style="s2">something I can make very pliable and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.770" end="00:19:35.850" style="s2">then up gradient the kinds of things I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.930" end="00:19:37.530" style="s2">like to see and we&#39;ve already seen that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.850" end="00:19:39.420" style="s2">like right now the thing that we used to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.530" end="00:19:41.160" style="s2">call the Federal Reserve guess what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.420" end="00:19:42.210" style="s2">gone I don&#39;t know you guys know but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.160" end="00:19:44.670" style="s2">changes that were made in the past</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.210" end="00:19:45.960" style="s2">couple of days so radically change the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.670" end="00:19:47.820" style="s2">nature of that construct that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.960" end="00:19:49.890" style="s2">called the Fed Reserve in name only and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.820" end="00:19:51.180" style="s2">those are serious shenanigans like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.890" end="00:19:54.510" style="s2">is a massive change the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.180" end="00:19:56.070" style="s2">financial structure of this country so</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.510" end="00:19:58.200" style="s2">check it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.070" end="00:19:59.430" style="s2">shenanigans done now there&#39;s other folks</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.200" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">who are trying to work some shenanigans</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.430" end="00:20:06.330" style="s2">to show we&#39;ll ask what happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">Fed oh well just do a little brief it</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.330" end="00:20:11.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take too much energy so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:13.140" style="s2">Federal Reserve&#39;s is very very limited</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.670" end="00:20:14.850" style="s2">in the kinds of things that&#39;s allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.140" end="00:20:16.020" style="s2">do by the way it&#39;s actual amended its</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.850" end="00:20:18.510" style="s2">miniscule compared to what it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.020" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">doing recently but most fundamentally it</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.510" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">can only operate through a very small</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:23.400" style="s2">number of primary lenders these big</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:24.390" style="s2">banks the too-big-to-fail banks the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.400" end="00:20:25.590" style="s2">reason why they&#39;re too big to fail is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.390" end="00:20:27.570" style="s2">because they&#39;re the way the Federal</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.590" end="00:20:28.770" style="s2">Reserve hits the real economy so if they</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.570" end="00:20:29.970" style="s2">failed the head of the Federal Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.770" end="00:20:31.980" style="s2">would have no interface with the real</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.970" end="00:20:32.400" style="s2">economy and they can only engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.980" end="00:20:34.140" style="s2">various</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.400" end="00:20:36.870" style="s2">small number of kinds of transactions</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.140" end="00:20:38.520" style="s2">with them it could take we called repo</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.870" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">actions this is going to get very</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.520" end="00:20:43.260" style="s2">esoteric break quick but some period of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.480" style="s2">time not long ago like three four days</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.260" end="00:20:46.950" style="s2">ago a complete restructure has put in</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.480" end="00:20:48.390" style="s2">place where a series of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.950" end="00:20:51.000" style="s2">called special-purpose vehicles were</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.390" end="00:20:52.710" style="s2">created managed by a private firm called</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.000" end="00:20:55.560" style="s2">Blackrock which is the world&#39;s largest</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.710" end="00:20:57.420" style="s2">asset manager and direct interface to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.560" end="00:21:00.570" style="s2">the United States Treasury which so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.420" end="00:21:02.910" style="s2">US Treasury now is able to and on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.570" end="00:21:05.430" style="s2">hook for put in Treasuries which is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.910" end="00:21:07.560" style="s2">kind of assets that Fed can count as</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.430" end="00:21:10.710" style="s2">being real things into these specialist</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.560" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">special-purpose vehicles the SPV s can</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.710" end="00:21:15.840" style="s2">then use those assets to acquire almost</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:17.970" style="s2">any kind of financial security which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.840" end="00:21:19.860" style="s2">safe equities like shares and companies</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.970" end="00:21:21.960" style="s2">and what&#39;s called corporate papers so</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.860" end="00:21:23.340" style="s2">bonds and companies put them on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.960" end="00:21:26.370" style="s2">books of the special-purpose vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.340" end="00:21:28.170" style="s2">and the Treasury&#39;s assets are what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.370" end="00:21:30.810" style="s2">called first law loser which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.170" end="00:21:33.810" style="s2">that if the price to say an SP V buy</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.810" end="00:21:36.660" style="s2">shares in uber an uber goes from 40 to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.810" end="00:21:39.630" style="s2">20 the United States Treasury takes that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.660" end="00:21:41.550" style="s2">loss so what that means is that as of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.630" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">right now two things have changed one</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.550" end="00:21:45.660" style="s2">the Treasury can now inject the quid aid</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:47.820" style="s2">directly into the into the economy at</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.660" end="00:21:49.500" style="s2">the most almost the most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.820" end="00:21:51.900" style="s2">level not quite down to human beings but</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.500" end="00:21:53.700" style="s2">we&#39;re getting there real quick and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.900" end="00:21:55.770" style="s2">US Treasury is actually not more or less</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.700" end="00:21:57.030" style="s2">driving the show they&#39;re actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.770" end="00:21:59.430" style="s2">other side of that actually being able</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.030" end="00:22:01.560" style="s2">to pressure things and I would be very</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.430" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">surprised if at this point now Secretary</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.560" end="00:22:05.610" style="s2">of Muchin and the president are not able</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:07.680" style="s2">to actually just do the things they want</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.610" end="00:22:09.060" style="s2">to do directly to the tunes or trillions</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.680" end="00:22:11.100" style="s2">of dollars and so that&#39;s what happened</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.060" end="00:22:12.750" style="s2">to the Fed now would say that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.100" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">high quality level of shenanigans all</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.750" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">right now let&#39;s look on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:21.510" style="s2">yes there are groups that are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:23.570" style="s2">what might replace it I am associated</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.510" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">with some of these groups</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.570" end="00:22:29.770" style="s2">have been for quite some time</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:29.770" style="s2">alternatives actually looked like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">radical devolution of authority and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.810" end="00:22:37.910" style="s2">power from the existing institutional</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">structures using a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.910" end="00:22:44.150" style="s2">principles to design new models so for</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:45.980" style="s2">example one principle is to push as much</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.150" end="00:22:49.070" style="s2">choice making authority down to the edge</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.980" end="00:22:51.260" style="s2">as possible so ubi is this very simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.070" end="00:22:53.210" style="s2">example and I don&#39;t mean ubi from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.260" end="00:22:54.950" style="s2">point of view of means I mean ubi from</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.210" end="00:22:56.840" style="s2">the point of view of how do you make a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.950" end="00:22:57.920" style="s2">functional economy actually no we just</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.840" end="00:23:00.530" style="s2">throw this out there let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.920" end="00:23:02.810" style="s2">people think about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.530" end="00:23:04.820" style="s2">take collective intelligence as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.810" end="00:23:06.140" style="s2">metaphor of the market the market is</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.820" end="00:23:07.580" style="s2">supposed to provide a really</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.140" end="00:23:09.320" style="s2">high-quality function of collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.580" end="00:23:11.030" style="s2">intelligence I had a price function</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.320" end="00:23:13.220" style="s2">supply and demand function supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.030" end="00:23:15.050" style="s2">tell us stuff a whole lot of stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.220" end="00:23:17.030" style="s2">what the very large number of people out</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.050" end="00:23:19.910" style="s2">there are perceiving is what is needful</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.030" end="00:23:23.270" style="s2">and are able to provide to that to that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.910" end="00:23:25.460" style="s2">need but we have at least two major</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.270" end="00:23:28.130" style="s2">problems with our collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.460" end="00:23:30.170" style="s2">intelligence as it exists right now one</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.130" end="00:23:32.210" style="s2">problem is we&#39;re not getting the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.170" end="00:23:35.510" style="s2">kind of signal balance from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.210" end="00:23:37.700" style="s2">nodes now if if Bill Gates has all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.510" end="00:23:39.620" style="s2">dollars then our market is getting all</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.700" end="00:23:41.030" style="s2">of its signals from one node now he</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.620" end="00:23:42.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t but he has a lot of them and</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.670" end="00:24:11.540" style="s2">right well ubi is at one point one</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.130" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">element of that is to correct that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.540" end="00:24:16.820" style="s2">need to I must inject an adequate amount</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:18.950" style="s2">of signal which in this case is money at</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.950" end="00:24:22.610" style="s2">getting signal from my entire network if</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.350" end="00:24:24.260" style="s2">I get that then I&#39;ve actually got a</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.260" end="00:24:27.320" style="s2">as to maximize the collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.400" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">intelligence and that just is a more</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.860" end="00:24:43.800" style="s2">another one I think is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.820" end="00:24:45.540" style="s2">powerful people grasp it and this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.800" end="00:24:46.940" style="s2">very well known but it&#39;s shocking how</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.540" end="00:24:49.860" style="s2">much economists have taken into account</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.940" end="00:24:51.690" style="s2">if I&#39;m looking at the the supply and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.860" end="00:24:55.940" style="s2">demand function we know that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.690" end="00:24:59.040" style="s2">massive cliff like a nonlinear jump in</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.040" end="00:25:05.010" style="s2">privation and so if I&#39;ve got enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:07.230" style="s2">money that I can tell somebody all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.010" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">so somebody comes to me and says I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.230" end="00:25:11.130" style="s2">like you to clean the toilets in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:12.300" style="s2">office building and I say all right well</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.130" end="00:25:13.410" style="s2">what do you willing to offer and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.300" end="00:25:16.290" style="s2">say bucks an hour</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.410" end="00:25:17.250" style="s2">my response is you because I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.290" end="00:25:18.810" style="s2"> you money</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.250" end="00:25:21.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible offer I ain&#39;t willing</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.810" end="00:25:23.130" style="s2">to do it but there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.060" end="00:25:25.650" style="s2">can&#39;t say you and the problem is in</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.130" end="00:25:27.570" style="s2">our particular economy if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.650" end="00:25:29.430" style="s2"> you money then you&#39;ve got oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.570" end="00:25:31.170" style="s2">about to get money you just have</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.430" end="00:25:32.670" style="s2">to say yes to whatever offer is made so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.170" end="00:25:35.820" style="s2">you got a whole lot of people grow</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.670" end="00:25:37.920" style="s2">radically being underbid there the price</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.820" end="00:25:39.960" style="s2">signal and demand signal or asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.920" end="00:25:43.470" style="s2">because of this non-linearity and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.960" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">ability to say no to an offer so by</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.470" end="00:25:48.270" style="s2">replacing people&#39;s ability to say no to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:50.100" style="s2">an offer you actually reestablish the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.270" end="00:25:51.950" style="s2">symmetry and continuity the price and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.100" end="00:25:54.180" style="s2">demand function now imagine what happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.950" end="00:25:55.590" style="s2">when somebody is now sitting there who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.180" end="00:25:57.180" style="s2">currently being paid minimum wage to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.590" end="00:25:58.650" style="s2">clean the toilets and JP Morgan&#39;s office</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.180" end="00:26:00.380" style="s2">building just says you I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.650" end="00:26:02.580" style="s2">gonna go home and plant a garden instead</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.380" end="00:26:03.540" style="s2">then the boys of JP Morgan have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.580" end="00:26:05.220" style="s2">figure out how they&#39;re gonna get their</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.540" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">toilets cleaned they got probably three</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.220" end="00:26:07.920" style="s2">choices right now they can clean their</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:10.110" style="s2">own damn toilets which is perfectly fine</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.920" end="00:26:11.970" style="s2">or they can pay a fair wage which will</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.110" end="00:26:13.170" style="s2">probably be in the order of like $85,000</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.970" end="00:26:15.390" style="s2">this is how much you have to pay me to</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.170" end="00:26:17.400" style="s2">clean their toilets and that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.390" end="00:26:19.620" style="s2">really actually what the price signal</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.400" end="00:26:21.660" style="s2">should be that&#39;s how much value this</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.620" end="00:26:23.160" style="s2">this actual work actually has if the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.660" end="00:26:25.820" style="s2">market was doing his job fairly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.160" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">what you would see then he got option 3</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.820" end="00:26:29.730" style="s2">if people are paying $90,000 to get</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.730" end="00:26:33.900" style="s2">musts gonna be doing not building</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.920" end="00:26:36.570" style="s2">electric cars he&#39;s gonna be building</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.900" end="00:26:37.620" style="s2">building toilet cleaning robots boom our</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.570" end="00:26:38.940" style="s2">economy is actually doing the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.620" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">stuff for the first time in a long time</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.940" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">all right if you think about ubi as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">mechanism for solving the problem of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:46.800" style="s2">fact that the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:48.630" style="s2">mechanisms or markets have actually not</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.800" end="00:26:49.960" style="s2">been functioning because they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.630" end="00:26:51.309" style="s2">been designed to program</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.960" end="00:26:52.929" style="s2">make sure that the signal we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.309" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">from the pricing and demand side is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.929" end="00:26:56.740" style="s2">actually right then you&#39;ve actually got</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:58.390" style="s2">your head on straight if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.740" end="00:27:00.010" style="s2">designing your economy and your finance</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.390" end="00:27:02.049" style="s2">around that kind of thinking right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.010" end="00:27:03.820" style="s2">it&#39;s just creating a network construct</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.049" end="00:27:04.929" style="s2">that gets the right kind of signal</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.820" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">through the graph the people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.929" end="00:27:08.260" style="s2">participating in to get maximum</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:11.230" style="s2">collective intelligence then you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.260" end="00:27:12.580" style="s2">design something actually works yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.230" end="00:27:14.380" style="s2">there are groups that are trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.580" end="00:27:16.840" style="s2">things like that on that basis</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.380" end="00:27:18.460" style="s2">with any luck we and/or they will start</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.840" end="00:27:19.870" style="s2">releasing proposals over the next couple</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.460" end="00:27:22.830" style="s2">of weeks because the opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.870" end="00:27:24.970" style="s2">actually doing is pretty high right now</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.830" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s some stuff again I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.970" end="00:27:27.820" style="s2">said a lot of words I can go on forever</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:29.070" style="s2">about it but it feels like hopping about</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.820" end="00:27:31.929" style="s2">seems to be the right thing to do here</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.070" end="00:27:33.460" style="s2">yeah I think everyone needs to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.929" end="00:27:35.950" style="s2">toilet-cleaning rooibos I think is what</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.460" end="00:27:37.809" style="s2">the takeaway from that is find the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.950" end="00:27:39.610" style="s2">dirtiest job that people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.809" end="00:27:40.840" style="s2">do and find a way to get robots to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.610" end="00:27:44.830" style="s2">that first if there&#39;s a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.840" end="00:27:55.779" style="s2">principle cool do we have David Jones on</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.830" end="00:27:58.840" style="s2">the call Dave yes I&#39;m a meeting Jim</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.779" end="00:28:01.510" style="s2">Jordan I think it&#39;s something about what</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.840" end="00:28:04.299" style="s2">do you see happening in the next medium</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.510" end="00:28:07.059" style="s2">in the medium term what&#39;s your what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.299" end="00:28:09.490" style="s2">your vision for what you&#39;d like to see I</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.059" end="00:28:11.260" style="s2">think you said specifically in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.490" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">culture war piece in your question Dave</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.260" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">it was the red well I actually heard two</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:22.539" style="s2">distinct questions there one was what do</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:24.870" style="s2">I see and what would I like to see which</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.539" end="00:28:24.870" style="s2">would you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:32.550" style="s2">both put again their loss all right all</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.320" end="00:28:35.220" style="s2">right I think I mentioned this in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.550" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">different venue and but I&#39;ll put it this</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.220" end="00:28:42.870" style="s2">way I&#39;m noticing that my hairstyle is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:45.420" style="s2">vectoring directly into the American</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.870" end="00:28:47.580" style="s2">Revolutionary vibe pretty soon I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.420" end="00:28:49.320" style="s2">have a Thomas Jefferson bow in my hair</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.580" end="00:28:50.220" style="s2">just because it&#39;s gonna be necessary I</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.320" end="00:28:50.970" style="s2">think everybody&#39;s going in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.220" end="00:28:52.710" style="s2">direction step</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.970" end="00:29:00.060" style="s2">Alexander Boehner is going more than one</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.710" end="00:29:04.350" style="s2">Stadion direction so one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.060" end="00:29:11.040" style="s2">think is a kind of a primary opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.350" end="00:29:17.040" style="s2">right now it&#39;s simply like growing up</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.040" end="00:29:18.380" style="s2">maybe or stepping into the how do I say</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.040" end="00:29:20.340" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.380" end="00:29:21.870" style="s2">all right maybe I&#39;ll say it this way</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.340" end="00:29:23.160" style="s2">this is just just a frame but you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.870" end="00:29:24.630" style="s2">you can do this across a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.160" end="00:29:25.710" style="s2">different dimensions so this frame is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.630" end="00:29:27.780" style="s2">hopefully this frame lands</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.780" end="00:29:32.760" style="s2">it worked out pretty well so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.330" end="00:29:34.230" style="s2">one of the the things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.760" end="00:29:36.150" style="s2">discovered or at least I&#39;ve noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.230" end="00:29:37.770" style="s2">that human beings have I think very</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.150" end="00:29:40.860" style="s2">distinctive Elemental stages in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.770" end="00:29:43.080" style="s2">lives there really is a difference</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.860" end="00:29:44.820" style="s2">between childhood adolescence young</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.080" end="00:29:46.430" style="s2">adulthood mature adulthood an elder hood</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.820" end="00:29:48.840" style="s2">are there just different stages</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.430" end="00:29:51.090" style="s2">neurologically physiologically all of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.840" end="00:29:52.290" style="s2">all the way down as you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.090" end="00:29:53.970" style="s2">somebody yesterday was give me a deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.290" end="00:29:55.950" style="s2">dive on the actual neurological changes</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.970" end="00:29:58.260" style="s2">that happen in men in their early 50s</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.950" end="00:30:01.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a real thing all right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.260" end="00:30:03.960" style="s2">one and then two we could talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.860" end="00:30:06.600" style="s2">notion of their deep being different in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.960" end="00:30:08.670" style="s2">this Chronos Kairos there are different</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.600" end="00:30:11.580" style="s2">states of the context that we find</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.670" end="00:30:13.020" style="s2">ourselves in and the hypothesis that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.580" end="00:30:14.310" style="s2">would put forward and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.020" end="00:30:16.050" style="s2">really matter too much whether my</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.310" end="00:30:17.430" style="s2">hypothesis is any good but use it as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.050" end="00:30:19.350" style="s2">as a way of thinking through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.430" end="00:30:21.090" style="s2">question that you&#39;re asking this is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.350" end="00:30:25.280" style="s2">way of of creating a model that helps</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.090" end="00:30:25.280" style="s2">anchor that is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.340" end="00:30:30.690" style="s2">things are good I think Dave actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.140" end="00:30:33.029" style="s2">sent me that message I this bad times</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.690" end="00:30:36.330" style="s2">create strong then that one something</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.029" end="00:30:38.070" style="s2">along that so during good times there</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.330" end="00:30:39.299" style="s2">are things that can be done and should</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.070" end="00:30:42.539" style="s2">be done by people at different</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.299" end="00:30:44.520" style="s2">developmental stages but during bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.539" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">times there&#39;s a transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.520" end="00:30:50.400" style="s2">needs to occur that there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:53.640" style="s2">different capacity or identity we need</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.400" end="00:30:56.820" style="s2">different things so for example in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.640" end="00:31:02.490" style="s2">case what I would say concretely is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.820" end="00:31:04.980" style="s2">the the elders really really need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.490" end="00:31:07.860" style="s2">step in to elder hood for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.980" end="00:31:09.179" style="s2">in our live so I don&#39;t meet me nearly</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.860" end="00:31:11.130" style="s2">people who happen to have a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:31:12.419" end="00:31:16.470" style="s2">bunch of times I mean people who have</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.309" end="00:31:18.120" style="s2">actually lived life and remember things</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.470" end="00:31:20.250" style="s2">like they remember when people actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.120" end="00:31:22.500" style="s2">used to sort of do things for the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.250" end="00:31:24.659" style="s2">reason when people thought that lying</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.500" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">was shameful when people knew their</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.659" end="00:31:28.080" style="s2">neighbors and cared for their neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:29.370" style="s2">like they have an invited experience of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.080" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">the things that we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.370" end="00:31:33.419" style="s2">relearn pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.740" style="s2">and they&#39;ve actually lived first person</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.419" end="00:31:36.179" style="s2">and they can share their first-person</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:38.909" style="s2">experiences of what meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.179" end="00:31:40.140" style="s2">actually is over the long arc and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.909" end="00:31:43.409" style="s2">think I said this previously I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.140" end="00:31:47.549" style="s2">care that much about the the stuff you</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.620" end="00:33:35.640" style="s2">and some of us have things some of us</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:37.230" style="s2">have been working a long time trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.640" end="00:33:38.040" style="s2">figure things out and we&#39;ve been awfully</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.230" end="00:33:39.960" style="s2">beaten down look it up</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.040" end="00:33:42.930" style="s2">alright I&#39;m gonna call out shout out to</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.860" end="00:33:53.130" style="s2">and this is the time where Gen X</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.720" end="00:33:55.050" style="s2">actually has to be willing to put</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.130" end="00:33:57.480" style="s2">ourselves right in the line and be</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.050" end="00:33:58.770" style="s2">willing to take risks as individuals and</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.920" end="00:34:10.620" style="s2">then you got your millennial</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.640" end="00:34:12.210" style="s2">responsibility and think about this Dave</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.620" end="00:34:13.830" style="s2">again from the point of view of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.210" end="00:34:15.420" style="s2">does it mean in the context of the</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.019" end="00:39:16.269" style="s2">already but I&#39;ll try and make it brief</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.380" end="00:39:17.589" style="s2">so given that it&#39;s the crisis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.269" end="00:39:20.529" style="s2">happening and it might be coming in</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.239" end="00:39:34.479" style="s2">all just shenanigans or are there any</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.219" end="00:39:36.249" style="s2">optimistic signs yet oh this is nice so</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.479" end="00:39:38.469" style="s2">check check this out certainly how I</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.249" end="00:39:39.819" style="s2">think it works it&#39;s a bit tricky but</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.469" end="00:39:48.029" style="s2">when you get you get sensitive to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.819" end="00:39:52.779" style="s2">you&#39;ll see it let&#39;s see hmm</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.029" end="00:39:56.469" style="s2">all right so imagine you&#39;ve heard that</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.779" end="00:39:57.579" style="s2">played that game with a parachute when</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.469" end="00:39:58.809" style="s2">you&#39;re a kid you all kind of get around</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.579" end="00:40:00.179" style="s2">it you hold it and you pull it taut and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.809" end="00:40:02.529" style="s2">you&#39;re carrying things</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.179" end="00:40:04.209" style="s2">all right so imagine that and imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.529" end="00:40:05.380" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.209" end="00:40:07.329" style="s2">structures we&#39;re familiar with right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.380" end="00:40:08.709" style="s2">and there&#39;s stuff heavy stuff on the on</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.329" end="00:40:14.439" style="s2">the on the tarp and people are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.709" end="00:40:16.329" style="s2">carry it the the bet but then imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.439" end="00:40:17.549" style="s2">that there&#39;s a oh wait maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.329" end="00:40:22.299" style="s2">even better</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.549" end="00:40:24.819" style="s2">mmm no I can&#39;t do that in yet but</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.299" end="00:40:27.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a different place like a totally</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.819" end="00:40:29.079" style="s2">different thing over here over to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.309" end="00:40:32.380" style="s2">right and nobody&#39;s picking it up and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.079" end="00:40:33.909" style="s2">nobody&#39;s carrying it and you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.380" end="00:40:35.289" style="s2">be a bunch of folks who are holding that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.909" end="00:40:36.549" style="s2">and they&#39;re carrying and they&#39;re lifting</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.289" end="00:40:37.959" style="s2">it they&#39;re moving along that&#39;s game a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.549" end="00:40:39.339" style="s2">right that&#39;s the world we live in and</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.959" end="00:40:41.049" style="s2">that and that&#39;s the stuff on that tarp</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.339" end="00:40:46.179" style="s2">is the things that is our lives are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.049" end="00:40:48.339" style="s2">things that were carrying and every time</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.179" end="00:40:50.019" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s holding under that tarp</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.339" end="00:40:52.689" style="s2">looks over and sees this over the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.019" end="00:40:53.949" style="s2">over here and they kind of nudge the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.689" end="00:40:56.859" style="s2">person next to them and kind of like hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.949" end="00:41:00.519" style="s2">that thing over there that&#39;s the game B</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.859" end="00:41:02.469" style="s2">piece and that&#39;s it&#39;s the the awakening</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.170" end="00:42:43.500" style="s2">here but it&#39;s happening very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.349" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">truly competent good people skillful</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.500" end="00:42:48.510" style="s2">smart are beginning to just say you know</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.510" end="00:42:51.420" style="s2">need to just get like phone and call the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.190" end="00:42:52.470" style="s2">guy I went to college with who had his</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.420" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2"> together and see what he&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.470" end="00:42:55.140" style="s2">and see if I can collaborate with him</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:56.970" style="s2">and then I&#39;m gonna figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.140" end="00:42:58.890" style="s2">create permission to do it inside the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.970" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m doing which is the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.890" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">that it always works best anyhow if</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:03.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever been inside some shitty</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:04.890" style="s2">corporate environment you always know</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.630" end="00:43:08.010" style="s2">the only things that ever happened when</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.890" end="00:43:10.200" style="s2">people actually create capacity peer to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.010" end="00:43:12.329" style="s2">peer inside the environment well in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.200" end="00:43:15.420" style="s2">case is doing is happening super rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.329" end="00:43:16.890" style="s2">and across the entire system and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.420" end="00:43:20.609" style="s2">actually have a whole lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.890" end="00:43:21.829" style="s2">are incredibly capable and have learned</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.609" end="00:43:22.980" style="s2">a lot of skills about things like</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.829" end="00:43:27.930" style="s2">counterinsurgency</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.980" end="00:43:29.430" style="s2">and intelligence you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.930" end="00:43:32.340" style="s2">a it was a different ball game in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.430" end="00:43:34.650" style="s2">1950s so that I think is the way to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.340" end="00:43:35.970" style="s2">think about it and when we have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.650" end="00:43:38.430" style="s2">we have to become increasingly conscious</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.970" end="00:43:39.600" style="s2">and mindful of how to cuz remember we</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.430" end="00:43:41.369" style="s2">don&#39;t want to drop the ball on this</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.600" end="00:43:42.780" style="s2">thing unfortunately that thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.369" end="00:43:45.840" style="s2">tarp that I was talking about the thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.780" end="00:43:48.420" style="s2">it&#39;s holding that&#39;s our lives and if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.840" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">let go of it our lives fall with it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.420" end="00:43:51.990" style="s2">that gets really bad really fast so we</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:55.020" style="s2">have to actually find a way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.990" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">like get the music to slow down and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.020" end="00:44:00.030" style="s2">have the capable hands the truly capable</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:03.420" style="s2">hands increasingly steer what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.030" end="00:44:05.910" style="s2">happening inside like it&#39;s a fabric that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.420" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">lifts up and weaves itself underneath so</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.910" end="00:44:09.990" style="s2">people are actually held in something</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:11.460" style="s2">that&#39;s real and then we begin to move</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.990" end="00:44:15.510" style="s2">over to this new attractor as people</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.460" end="00:44:17.369" style="s2">kind of point at it so yes I am seeing</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.510" end="00:44:19.260" style="s2">some things happening inside what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.369" end="00:44:21.570" style="s2">would call existing institutions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.260" end="00:44:23.130" style="s2">largely correlates with the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.570" end="00:44:28.980" style="s2">which those constructs are made up of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.130" end="00:44:30.119" style="s2">people who are close to reality let me</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.980" end="00:44:33.000" style="s2">can I can I feed one more piece of</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.119" end="00:44:34.020" style="s2">theory in here I was talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.000" end="00:44:37.050" style="s2">somebody just today and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.020" end="00:44:38.670" style="s2">actually very useful I was asking the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.050" end="00:44:41.190" style="s2">question of why it is the dairy dog went</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.670" end="00:44:43.470" style="s2">wrong because I got to tell you dairy</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.190" end="00:44:46.310" style="s2">dad went wrong and the reason why it</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.470" end="00:44:49.800" style="s2">went wrong I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.310" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">when the pipes burst in his apartment he</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.800" end="00:44:53.790" style="s2">did not fix those pipes himself in fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:55.830" style="s2">in all likelihood he didn&#39;t even call</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.790" end="00:44:58.290" style="s2">the plumber he had to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.830" end="00:44:59.550" style="s2">supervisor supervisor called the plumber</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.290" end="00:45:01.170" style="s2">the plumber fixed the pipes which is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.550" end="00:45:03.690" style="s2">say the dairy dog was the first person</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.170" end="00:45:05.460" style="s2">experience in Baudrillard simulation the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.690" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">farther you are away from reality the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.460" end="00:45:08.190" style="s2">more likely it is that you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:09.300" style="s2">yourself playing in simulation space</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.190" end="00:45:10.590" style="s2">which means you&#39;re going to lose the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.300" end="00:45:13.740" style="s2">thread you&#39;re gonna have to play games</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.590" end="00:45:15.690" style="s2">by capital in social segments</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.740" end="00:45:17.880" style="s2">manipulating or getting other people to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.690" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">do the stuff you wanted to do instead of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.880" end="00:45:21.990" style="s2">having be able to actually be directly</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.640" style="s2">bound to reality so the people in</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.640" end="00:45:27.300" style="s2">bound to reality they&#39;re the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.130" end="00:45:29.010" style="s2">actually starting to have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.300" end="00:45:30.300" style="s2">things out the people who are the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.010" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">furthest away from me outta that ones</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.300" end="00:45:33.420" style="s2">are the deepest in the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones who are actually very</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.420" end="00:45:36.840" style="s2">confused and or dangerous and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:38.970" style="s2">to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.840" end="00:45:41.490" style="s2">to decouple their capacity to make</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.570" end="00:45:46.710" style="s2">amenable to it so that&#39;s a long-winded</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.360" end="00:49:37.120" style="s2">out how to support people and doing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.800" end="00:49:41.320" style="s2">thing that they have to do anyway and</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.440" end="00:49:48.010" style="s2">it was a shift if it&#39;s a shift there I</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.330" end="00:49:54.070" style="s2">would consider that to be the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.010" end="00:49:57.700" style="s2">possible boon thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.070" end="00:50:00.460" style="s2">I think Teemo Teemo your next team oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.700" end="00:50:02.230" style="s2">shoot yeah I joined I think my question</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.460" end="00:50:04.450" style="s2">somehow relates to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.230" end="00:50:06.820" style="s2">question just going to read it out so</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.450" end="00:50:08.200" style="s2">well the c19 crisis presents a great</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.820" end="00:50:10.450" style="s2">chance to get people to question</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.200" end="00:50:12.580" style="s2">existing institutions and to deploy new</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.450" end="00:50:13.930" style="s2">ways of sense-making it also creates a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.580" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">chance for governments to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.930" end="00:50:18.340" style="s2">lasting authoritarian measures without</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:20.770" style="s2">resistance as they can be effective in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.340" end="00:50:22.570" style="s2">the current situation so how can</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.770" end="00:50:24.310" style="s2">something like decentralize collective</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.570" end="00:50:26.530" style="s2">intelligence or game be gained traction</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.310" end="00:50:28.630" style="s2">in a time in which authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.530" end="00:50:30.790" style="s2">measures can be perceived perceived as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.630" end="00:50:35.560" style="s2">valid fallback option to weather crisis</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.790" end="00:50:37.180" style="s2">situations like this yeah well I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.560" end="00:50:38.440" style="s2">this goes back to that notion of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.180" end="00:50:40.090" style="s2">I think right now we&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.440" end="00:50:42.910" style="s2">where things could either move very well</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.090" end="00:50:44.320" style="s2">or they can move very poorly I think the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.910" end="00:50:47.320" style="s2">general answer is if we were on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.320" end="00:50:49.720" style="s2">other side of authoritarian measures</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.320" end="00:50:52.780" style="s2">putting being put in place and it will</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.720" end="00:50:54.340" style="s2">make it much harder for us not</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.780" end="00:50:56.890" style="s2">catastrophic it&#39;s not impossible just</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.340" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">make it much harder and by the way it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.890" end="00:51:05.109" style="s2">make the consequences of the shifts more</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:07.180" style="s2">let&#39;s call it energetic so the key right</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.109" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">now is to figure out how can we go about</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.180" end="00:51:10.900" style="s2">nudging and influencing the shift that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:12.970" style="s2">takes place so as to minimize that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.900" end="00:51:14.530" style="s2">whenever possible actually maximize the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.970" end="00:51:19.570" style="s2">good side so I&#39;ll give you a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.530" end="00:51:21.940" style="s2">example this is really really real like</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.570" end="00:51:25.510" style="s2">right now and over the next several days</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.940" end="00:51:27.220" style="s2">and near-term weeks significant choices</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.510" end="00:51:28.690" style="s2">are being made in the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.220" end="00:51:29.920" style="s2">everywhere else around the world the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.690" end="00:51:32.020" style="s2">choices of large has already been made</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.920" end="00:51:33.820" style="s2">in China as I understand it about how</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.020" end="00:51:37.450" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go about trying to address</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.820" end="00:51:41.650" style="s2">the problem of contact tracing for</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.450" end="00:51:43.210" style="s2">example or testing now there are many</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.650" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">many possible solutions and actually now</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.210" end="00:51:46.810" style="s2">come to mind with Ivan Illich there have</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:48.970" style="s2">always been many solutions around</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.810" end="00:51:51.550" style="s2">education we just chose the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.970" end="00:51:54.070" style="s2">were bad there are many solutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.550" end="00:51:57.000" style="s2">question of how do we actually build an</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.070" end="00:51:59.890" style="s2">infrastructure that is able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.000" end="00:52:03.250" style="s2">powerfully effortlessly respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.890" end="00:52:07.590" style="s2">problem domain of these kinds of events</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.250" end="00:52:07.590" style="s2">to crises along the viral and viruses</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.830" end="00:52:12.609" style="s2">what I would like to see is wisdom being</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.780" end="00:52:13.030" style="s2">used in those designs and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.609" end="00:52:14.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.030" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">naively there are actually people asking</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.920" end="00:52:17.740" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:19.600" style="s2">significant powerful people are asking</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.740" end="00:52:21.610" style="s2">for that we just need to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.600" end="00:52:22.750" style="s2">create space for it and then bring the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.610" end="00:52:25.270" style="s2">right people in so that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.750" end="00:52:30.220" style="s2">propose designs that will solve the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.270" end="00:52:32.740" style="s2">problem well for the long term and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.220" end="00:52:33.910" style="s2">was not only without threats to freedom</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.740" end="00:52:36.010" style="s2">and liberty in our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.910" end="00:52:37.270" style="s2">communicate in affected with each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.010" end="00:52:37.510" style="s2">but actually up gradient that make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.270" end="00:52:39.610" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.510" end="00:52:42.700" style="s2">so I think right now the situation is</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.610" end="00:52:44.230" style="s2">the the the die are about to be cast and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.700" end="00:52:46.300" style="s2">when it is incumbent upon us to find a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.230" end="00:52:47.800" style="s2">way to put pressure to create the space</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.300" end="00:52:51.250" style="s2">to make sure that good solutions are put</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.800" end="00:52:52.660" style="s2">in place if we can find AK one thing so</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.250" end="00:52:53.770" style="s2">I said if I there&#39;s one thing that comes</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.660" end="00:52:55.180" style="s2">out of this that I would like to see be</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.770" end="00:52:57.250" style="s2">a boom but you have massive shift in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.180" end="00:52:59.740" style="s2">nature of how we go about supporting the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.250" end="00:53:01.030" style="s2">development of our children if I had one</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.740" end="00:53:02.770" style="s2">thing that I would talk about people</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.030" end="00:53:08.350" style="s2">just rallying around and just saying no</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.770" end="00:53:11.590" style="s2">to would be just short-term mindless</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.350" end="00:53:13.240" style="s2">solutions to these problems you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.590" end="00:53:15.970" style="s2">what it&#39;s if I could get people to say I</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.240" end="00:53:18.270" style="s2">would prefer I am willing to stay in</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.970" end="00:53:21.340" style="s2">quarantine for another six weeks in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.270" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">exchange for having a good solution to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.340" end="00:53:26.140" style="s2">this problem like a trade-off on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:28.090" style="s2">part of the people we demand a good</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.140" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">design we demand this something actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.090" end="00:53:32.080" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:35.290" style="s2">in exchange we&#39;re not gonna riot in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.080" end="00:53:37.630" style="s2">streets where I can do crazy stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.290" end="00:53:40.450" style="s2">okay we will create some space for this</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.630" end="00:53:41.890" style="s2">to happen and that would be a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.450" end="00:53:43.000" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t know if we can pull it off</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.890" end="00:53:44.650" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of diverse</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.000" end="00:53:46.060" style="s2">interest out there and I get it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.650" end="00:53:47.620" style="s2">people who have small businesses right</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.060" end="00:53:49.480" style="s2">now are feeling really really put upon</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.620" end="00:53:50.470" style="s2">it people who work for a living and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.480" end="00:53:51.700" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of coverage you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.470" end="00:53:53.560" style="s2">feeling really really put about I</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.700" end="00:53:54.670" style="s2">understand that and so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.560" end="00:53:59.170" style="s2">urgency to figure out how to put</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.670" end="00:54:01.210" style="s2">solutions together you know so such as</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.170" end="00:54:03.460" style="s2">is Right Kairos is never pretty we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.210" end="00:54:04.900" style="s2">right in the middle of a very messy</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.460" end="00:54:06.310" style="s2">circumstance and bad things are</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.900" end="00:54:07.390" style="s2">happening and left and right so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.310" end="00:54:08.650" style="s2">got to try to figure out how we can get</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.390" end="00:54:12.970" style="s2">as smooth as possible to make as good</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.650" end="00:54:14.740" style="s2">things happen to me a question about Q</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.970" end="00:54:17.590" style="s2">so that&#39;s thoughts flashed across my</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.740" end="00:54:20.680" style="s2">screen yeah there was a question but</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.590" end="00:54:22.930" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t kind of very appropriately an</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.680" end="00:54:25.600" style="s2">anonymous question in the document that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.930" end="00:54:28.810" style="s2">just says you frequently allude to Q do</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.600" end="00:54:29.880" style="s2">you follow Q drops yes I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.810" end="00:54:32.020" style="s2">into that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.880" end="00:54:33.910" style="s2">I&#39;m into it yeah I think I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.020" end="00:54:35.290" style="s2">public on it I&#39;ve tried to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.910" end="00:54:36.750" style="s2">to everything it&#39;s good interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.290" end="00:54:39.790" style="s2">Sigma and it doesn&#39;t mean that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.750" end="00:54:41.350" style="s2">considered the structural huh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.790" end="00:54:44.110" style="s2">actually funny I think if this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.350" end="00:54:48.300" style="s2">confuses people a whole lot when I say</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.110" end="00:54:48.300" style="s2">something mmm I&#39;m gonna say it right I</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:57.070" style="s2">really believe that the particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.640" end="00:54:58.810" style="s2">arrangement of words that are presented</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.070" end="00:55:02.130" style="s2">by a person who&#39;s saying something is</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.810" end="00:55:03.820" style="s2">the meaning that is being conveyed</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.130" end="00:55:06.580" style="s2">particularly anything that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.820" end="00:55:08.110" style="s2">in a public domain that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.580" end="00:55:10.780" style="s2">doing when I see something what I see is</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.110" end="00:55:12.520" style="s2">I try to figure out what&#39;s going on how</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.780" end="00:55:14.710" style="s2">is that showing up why is it showing</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.520" end="00:55:17.380" style="s2">them what&#39;s the context is giving rise</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.710" end="00:55:19.330" style="s2">to it like if you think about it this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.380" end="00:55:20.950" style="s2">very Brett Weinstein and when I see a</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.330" end="00:55:22.870" style="s2">saber-toothed tiger I&#39;m not inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.950" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">into the saber-tooth tiger I&#39;m inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.870" end="00:55:26.620" style="s2">into the niche to gave rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:28.630" style="s2">saber-tooth tiger and so when I see a</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.620" end="00:55:30.040" style="s2">cue drop I don&#39;t really care about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.630" end="00:55:32.350" style="s2">content in the cue drop I care about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.040" end="00:55:34.060" style="s2">context that it&#39;s telling me about what</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.350" end="00:55:36.210" style="s2">that implies for everything else in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.060" end="00:55:39.610" style="s2">entire environment that I&#39;m operating in</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.210" end="00:55:41.830" style="s2">so hell yeah when Q first emerged I</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.610" end="00:55:43.540" style="s2">think I was there on 4chan about a week</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.830" end="00:55:44.590" style="s2">after it first showed up cuz I had some</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.540" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">other folks were watching her and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.590" end="00:55:49.030" style="s2">closer they said she&#39;d probably pay</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:51.670" style="s2">attention to this so I did a lot by the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.030" end="00:55:53.860" style="s2">way like I went straight crazy</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.670" end="00:55:56.680" style="s2">I drove all the way into it I was on</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.860" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">4chan probably five or six hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.680" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">and on a chain and all the other chants</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:01.780" style="s2">and all that kind of I gave up</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:03.550" style="s2">after about four or five months because</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.780" end="00:56:05.080" style="s2">I kind of absorbed the end energy like</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.550" end="00:56:06.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve figured it out and got an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.080" end="00:56:09.190" style="s2">sense of what was going on there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.190" end="00:56:12.700" style="s2">possibility these days the queue drops</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.190" end="00:56:14.710" style="s2">are telling me what is the cultural that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.700" end="00:56:19.560" style="s2">culturally approved or permissioned</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.710" end="00:56:22.840" style="s2">expressions in a particular subset of I</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.560" end="00:56:26.940" style="s2">guess culture space so there&#39;s still</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.830" end="00:57:36.780" style="s2">yes eyeko hey um thanks Jordan so my</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:38.840" style="s2">question in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.780" end="00:57:41.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve just had a run-in recently with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.840" end="00:57:44.220" style="s2">national security state and the medical</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.370" end="00:57:47.760" style="s2">context basically I just was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.220" end="00:57:49.140" style="s2">if you had any advice and for people in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.760" end="00:57:51.600" style="s2">this situation because I&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.140" end="00:57:54.720" style="s2">been in this situation before the basic</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.600" end="00:57:57.150" style="s2">situation is my sense making capacity</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:57:59.880" style="s2">has been improving and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.150" end="00:58:02.610" style="s2">interact with with familial relations</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.880" end="00:58:04.980" style="s2">that are still in the simulation and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.610" end="00:58:07.560" style="s2">then the simulating the person in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.980" end="00:58:09.900" style="s2">simulation puts you into the medical</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.560" end="00:58:12.090" style="s2">system and then they give you the drugs</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.900" end="00:58:14.970" style="s2">to dumb down the sense making capacity</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.090" end="00:58:17.250" style="s2">so what should be deeper into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.970" end="00:58:20.670" style="s2">simulation I&#39;ve been taking qualia</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.250" end="00:58:22.440" style="s2">before their incident and now after and</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.670" end="00:58:24.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not taking the medication I</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.440" end="00:58:26.970" style="s2">was prescribed and my sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.570" end="00:58:28.860" style="s2">returning but I guess what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.970" end="00:58:32.550" style="s2">the intersection between the national</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.860" end="00:58:36.600" style="s2">security state in the medical context to</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.550" end="00:58:38.670" style="s2">suppress the thought and and and trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.600" end="00:58:41.310" style="s2">to relate to the some people in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.670" end="00:58:42.870" style="s2">simulation that like my parents you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.310" end="00:58:45.540" style="s2">like I&#39;m talking about my parents and my</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.870" end="00:58:47.880" style="s2">family who are the ones putting me in -</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.540" end="00:58:49.080" style="s2">do you have any any advice for people</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.880" end="00:58:51.540" style="s2">because I&#39;m I&#39;m not the only one</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.080" end="00:58:54.000" style="s2">obviously but finding other people that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.540" end="00:58:55.140" style="s2">are in this situation is very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.000" end="00:58:56.730" style="s2">and I&#39;m just wondering if you had any</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.140" end="00:58:59.700" style="s2">advice for kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.730" end="00:59:01.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s kind of this polarity I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.700" end="00:59:04.140" style="s2">stuck in between being forced to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.920" end="00:59:06.480" style="s2">this medication which I&#39;m not taking and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.140" end="00:59:09.120" style="s2">something like qualia which is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.480" end="00:59:12.210" style="s2">me out of and and and into the seats</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.120" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">making capacity that I need I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.210" end="00:59:16.560" style="s2">to lose the sense making capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:19.350" style="s2">I&#39;m obtaining through interactions like</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.560" end="00:59:22.530" style="s2">this I want to increase that capacity so</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.350" end="00:59:28.800" style="s2">it&#39;s very moment alright so here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.530" end="00:59:33.750" style="s2">this is um these are dangerous waters so</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.800" end="00:59:37.410" style="s2">we have to be very very careful the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.750" end="00:59:41.340" style="s2">question of mental health is a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.410" end="00:59:44.880" style="s2">significant question I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.340" end="00:59:47.970" style="s2">obvious so I would just say so just put</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.880" end="00:59:51.030" style="s2">it very plainly that the context that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.970" end="00:59:53.600" style="s2">have been in thus far is not one that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.030" end="00:59:55.610" style="s2">particularly conducive to mental health</p>

<p begin="00:59:57.480" end="01:00:04.980" style="s2">significantly so we&#39;re in a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.300" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">pickle we don&#39;t actually have a very</p>

<p begin="01:04:23.000" end="01:04:34.460" style="s2">challenge so the question is there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.460" end="01:04:37.369" style="s2">many so much abundance of byproducts</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.460" end="01:04:42.080" style="s2">that may be seen as negatives at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.369" end="01:04:46.460" style="s2">moment how do we make the best use case</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.080" end="01:04:48.770" style="s2">scenario to flip those byproducts and</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.460" end="01:04:51.109" style="s2">I&#39;ll give a couple of examples into our</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.770" end="01:04:53.480" style="s2">solution in such so for example</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.109" end="01:04:56.240" style="s2">significant amount of people being laid</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.480" end="01:04:59.869" style="s2">off obviously they have a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.240" end="01:05:01.609" style="s2">they confined to a small space how do we</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.869" end="01:05:03.500" style="s2">best empower them to be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.609" end="01:05:06.859" style="s2">solution as opposed to a seeing that as</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.500" end="01:05:08.960" style="s2">a problem that we need to fix and there</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.859" end="01:05:11.119" style="s2">are many many other circumstances like</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.960" end="01:05:13.630" style="s2">that including the amount of people that</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.119" end="01:05:16.700" style="s2">are out there trying to create solutions</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.630" end="01:05:21.520" style="s2">so how do we unify them and create a</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.700" end="01:05:25.280" style="s2">self organization and have the I guess</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.520" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">the right things emerge that can</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.280" end="01:05:32.540" style="s2">resonate with enough people for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:35.390" style="s2">outcomes to not only make impact now but</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.540" end="01:05:38.150" style="s2">last so they can be applied to I guess</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.390" end="01:05:42.470" style="s2">our future civilizations and ecosystems</p>

<p begin="01:06:59.720" end="01:07:06.050" style="s2">the same use case as we&#39;ve had in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.680" end="01:07:07.250" style="s2">boardrooms where we need the good men to</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.050" end="01:07:08.990" style="s2">fight the fight and start those</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.250" end="01:07:11.090" style="s2">conversations and open the doors we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.990" end="01:07:15.290" style="s2">going to need that same scenario to play</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.090" end="01:07:18.050" style="s2">out for for women&#39;s potential to also be</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.290" end="01:07:19.790" style="s2">impactful at least time so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.050" end="01:07:23.870" style="s2">the two things they question and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.790" end="01:07:25.460" style="s2">challenge well maybe maybe working</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.870" end="01:07:27.830" style="s2">backwards maybe working backwards I got</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.460" end="01:07:30.650" style="s2">to tell you it is my instinct it is my</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.830" end="01:07:33.140" style="s2">distinct intuition that it is actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.650" end="01:07:35.150" style="s2">in some sense almost the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.140" end="01:07:37.790" style="s2">way you ended it I am reasonably sure</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.150" end="01:07:39.830" style="s2">that the the successful navigation of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.790" end="01:07:41.660" style="s2">this crisis is ultimately a question</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.830" end="01:07:45.350" style="s2">that is lying on the side of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.660" end="01:07:47.810" style="s2">feminine I think the masculine has a</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.350" end="01:07:50.300" style="s2">role to play for sure it&#39;s a significant</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.810" end="01:07:51.590" style="s2">one but I do believe and I cannot give</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.300" end="01:07:52.940" style="s2">you good reasons for why this is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.590" end="01:07:54.290" style="s2">case otherwise Majan I could make some</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.940" end="01:07:56.390" style="s2">up if we pressed it if you press me hard</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.290" end="01:07:57.740" style="s2">enough there wouldn&#39;t be they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.390" end="01:08:00.050" style="s2">just be figured out in the real time</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.740" end="01:08:02.930" style="s2">that the feminine is the actual answer</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.050" end="01:08:06.560" style="s2">to this to the question so that makes</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.930" end="01:08:08.270" style="s2">your question even more intense so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.560" end="01:08:10.160" style="s2">thing that came to me while I was trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.270" end="01:08:12.380" style="s2">to inquire into into the situation</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.160" end="01:08:14.660" style="s2">you&#39;re describing is I think I think one</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.380" end="01:08:17.030" style="s2">of the problems we have is that we found</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.660" end="01:08:22.640" style="s2">ourselves kind of stuck in the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.030" end="01:08:27.370" style="s2">something and we have or had effective</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.640" end="01:08:27.370" style="s2">ways of doing things in the 70s</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.190" end="01:08:34.040" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t yet figured out effective</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.650" end="01:08:36.230" style="s2">ways of doing things in 2020 so I can</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.040" end="01:08:37.699" style="s2">see that being a devolution now the the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.230" end="01:08:39.410" style="s2">middle zone that we&#39;ve been sitting in</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.699" end="01:08:41.540" style="s2">for the past 20 years which has been</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.410" end="01:08:43.339" style="s2">trying to figure out how to actually get</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.540" end="01:08:48.350" style="s2">to a solid developmental stage which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.339" end="01:08:51.739" style="s2">at the next level squishy right</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.350" end="01:08:53.060" style="s2">it&#39;s squishy it is not solid and so it</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.739" end="01:08:54.500" style="s2">can happen I can apps that can see we</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.060" end="01:08:56.089" style="s2">were saying I have not experienced this</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.500" end="01:08:57.020" style="s2">firsthand because I would smack somebody</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.089" end="01:08:58.580" style="s2">in the back of the head if they said</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.020" end="01:09:00.529" style="s2">some like that in front of me but I</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.580" end="01:09:02.540" style="s2">can see it happening because they would</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.529" end="01:09:03.620" style="s2">just drop down like I can&#39;t make I</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.540" end="01:09:04.940" style="s2">cannot figure out how to make things</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.620" end="01:09:06.890" style="s2">work right now I&#39;ve got to drop down to</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.940" end="01:09:09.109" style="s2">something I understand and they just pop</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.890" end="01:09:11.750" style="s2">down to a previous level that makes</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.109" end="01:09:12.890" style="s2">sense I could see that so the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.750" end="01:09:14.480" style="s2">I think is this challenges can we</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.890" end="01:09:16.400" style="s2">actually go through rapid development to</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.480" end="01:09:20.509" style="s2">something that is solid as but</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.400" end="01:09:23.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the next level up yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.509" end="01:09:25.400" style="s2">sounds good that sounds right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.150" end="01:09:26.480" style="s2">game you guys want to put another one of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.400" end="01:09:28.460" style="s2">these things together we actually try to</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.480" end="01:09:29.900" style="s2">take that on directly I&#39;m in I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.460" end="01:09:37.339" style="s2">participate I&#39;ll throw it down whatever</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.900" end="01:09:39.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve got awesome yeah weird so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.339" end="01:09:40.759" style="s2">been recording this and I think there</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.230" end="01:09:44.330" style="s2">was a question maybe from you Catherine</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.759" end="01:09:46.430" style="s2">whether this will be transcribed yes I</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.330" end="01:09:47.630" style="s2">can get the the audio transcribed and</p>
