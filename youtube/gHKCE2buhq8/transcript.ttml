<p begin="00:15:15.320" end="00:15:21.950" style="s2">I really like the analogy of the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.640" end="00:15:25.340" style="s2">to the existence of dark matter in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.950" end="00:15:27.560" style="s2">universe that you know this whole notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.340" end="00:15:29.780" style="s2">of dark matter at the moment is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.560" end="00:15:31.850" style="s2">more than an intellectual construct to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.780" end="00:15:33.560" style="s2">make equations work right that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.850" end="00:15:39.620" style="s2">that&#39;s all it is it has no reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.560" end="00:15:43.250" style="s2">beyond that yet and so yeah the notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.620" end="00:15:46.580" style="s2">that that&#39;s that the invention of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.250" end="00:15:49.280" style="s2">thing is in fact a reflection of our own</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.580" end="00:15:51.890" style="s2">shadows imposed onto the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.280" end="00:15:55.370" style="s2">the universe right this dark mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.890" end="00:15:57.530" style="s2">thing which we don&#39;t like to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.370" end="00:15:59.440" style="s2">we can&#39;t look at it whatever but but</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.530" end="00:16:03.080" style="s2">it&#39;s there and it&#39;s real and it binds</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.440" end="00:16:07.220" style="s2">the stuff we can see together something</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.080" end="00:16:09.380" style="s2">like that it&#39;s a projection of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.220" end="00:16:12.050" style="s2">psyches onto the cosmos it&#39;s are really</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.380" end="00:16:15.380" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.050" end="00:16:17.750" style="s2">idea and then of course layered on top</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.380" end="00:16:19.580" style="s2">of that is dark energy which pushes</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.750" end="00:16:23.300" style="s2">everything apart writes this dark</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.580" end="00:16:26.330" style="s2">sinister force that is everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.300" end="00:16:28.760" style="s2">forcing everything apart it&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.330" end="00:16:32.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a was it Carly isn&#39;t it is it Carly</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.760" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">the destructor yeah that sort of notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.740" end="00:16:38.810" style="s2">so yeah I think I think I think all</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:42.110" style="s2">that&#39;s really the another thing which</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.810" end="00:16:44.810" style="s2">occurred was was the idea that if it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.110" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">true that we are just the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.810" end="00:16:49.900" style="s2">the universe truly waking up to itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:53.480" style="s2">for the first time right - it did - the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.900" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">unimaginable unlimited potential that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.480" end="00:16:59.150" style="s2">contains within it if that is true then</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:17:01.310" style="s2">then what we experience as consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.150" end="00:17:04.970" style="s2">and you know this rich fantastic world</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.310" end="00:17:09.770" style="s2">is but the tiniest tiniest tiniest</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.970" end="00:17:11.930" style="s2">sliver our first the first crack which</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.770" end="00:17:14.030" style="s2">is opened into a whole new realm right</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.930" end="00:17:16.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s all we know and so we think</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.030" end="00:17:19.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the world but but it but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.130" end="00:17:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s nothing at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.100" end="00:17:24.199" style="s2">so if that&#39;s supposition if the initial</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.250" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">supposition is true we are just at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.199" end="00:17:29.720" style="s2">beginning at the very very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:34.440" style="s2">beginning of a journey which</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.720" end="00:17:38.270" style="s2">utterly inconceivable to us so that no</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.440" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">wonder that would fill us with fear at</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.270" end="00:17:44.970" style="s2">you know at as always pre existential</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">level right it is it is no wonder that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.970" end="00:17:50.960" style="s2">we are so filled with fear and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:53.550" style="s2">trepidation and so the embarking on that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.960" end="00:17:56.970" style="s2">this is Jordan Peters and stuff again</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.550" end="00:17:59.670" style="s2">right shouldering that and embarking on</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.970" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">the journey anyway even in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.670" end="00:18:04.580" style="s2">overwhelming fear this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:08.280" style="s2">challenge right some something like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.580" end="00:18:10.020" style="s2">and yeah I mean historically not many</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.280" end="00:18:12.510" style="s2">people have the courage to shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.020" end="00:18:16.680" style="s2">really really really big burdens you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.510" end="00:18:18.660" style="s2">know so yeah and I know the thing which</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.680" end="00:18:21.060" style="s2">occurred was was this notion of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.660" end="00:18:22.530" style="s2">right on the brink of something I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.060" end="00:18:23.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve just been talking about that with</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.530" end="00:18:25.890" style="s2">that we&#39;re right on the brink of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.400" end="00:18:28.350" style="s2">something but I also wonder if because</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.890" end="00:18:30.120" style="s2">if you look back through history there</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.350" end="00:18:31.680" style="s2">are always people writing about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.120" end="00:18:33.570" style="s2">this is a great opportunity for change</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.680" end="00:18:35.100" style="s2">the world is falling apart around our</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.570" end="00:18:37.110" style="s2">ears you know blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.100" end="00:18:39.330" style="s2">always always always be in the case</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.110" end="00:18:41.480" style="s2">there&#39;s been people talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.330" end="00:18:44.970" style="s2">kind of thing and so I just wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.480" end="00:18:47.640" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a condition of our psyche to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.970" end="00:18:50.730" style="s2">feel that we are always on the brink of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.640" end="00:18:52.170" style="s2">some grand thing yeah that we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.730" end="00:18:53.940" style="s2">on the brink but we never ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.170" end="00:18:56.970" style="s2">breakthrough and that this is just just</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.940" end="00:18:58.440" style="s2">just part of our condition this is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.970" end="00:19:00.270" style="s2">drives us forward is thinking we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.440" end="00:19:02.460" style="s2">almost there even though there is no</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.270" end="00:19:04.770" style="s2">there is no there right there there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.460" end="00:19:07.800" style="s2">no there it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.770" end="00:19:11.430" style="s2">attractor it&#39;s a direction it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.800" end="00:19:13.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a journey into literally the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.430" end="00:19:16.050" style="s2">infinite not that as a hyperbolic use</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.800" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">but but but literally the infinite so</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.050" end="00:19:20.970" style="s2">they cannot be there cannot be a place</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:23.400" style="s2">where you are going right the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.970" end="00:19:25.260" style="s2">whole notion of that is is absurd so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.400" end="00:19:27.780" style="s2">breaking through into this new thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.260" end="00:19:29.190" style="s2">well that&#39;s happening every single</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.780" end="00:19:31.140" style="s2">moment of every single day of every</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.190" end="00:19:33.270" style="s2">single lifetime is that you are breaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.140" end="00:19:34.650" style="s2">through into a new thing the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.270" end="00:19:36.030" style="s2">that it more often than not looks much</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.650" end="00:19:41.940" style="s2">like the old thing right because our</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.030" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">eyes are not open to the becomingness of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.940" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">we got this static vision of the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">around us of these objects which are</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:54.690" style="s2">there whether we&#39;re there are but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:56.279" style="s2">constant becomingness of things is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.690" end="00:19:58.970" style="s2">something which is outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.279" end="00:19:58.970" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.460" end="00:20:19.860" style="s2">radical uncertainty a patient of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.290" end="00:20:21.330" style="s2">is equal to the proportion of no matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.860" end="00:20:24.630" style="s2">in the university proportions</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.330" end="00:20:28.380" style="s2">unknown is equal to the amount of dark</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.630" end="00:20:32.580" style="s2">matter in the universe that is how</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.380" end="00:20:34.860" style="s2">little we know and we do not dare think</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.580" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">about that because how terrified would</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.630" end="00:25:45.050" style="s2">right there the then not believing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.050" end="00:25:47.480" style="s2">father is in a way the denial of the</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.480" end="00:25:51.950" style="s2">you&#39;ll present it right that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.160" end="00:25:54.670" style="s2">in in a sense the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.950" end="00:25:57.530" style="s2">embodiment of the father are the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.670" end="00:26:00.500" style="s2">structures that you have and that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.530" end="00:26:04.100" style="s2">put in place then then and and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.500" end="00:26:07.610" style="s2">the the ontology zhh may be wrong well</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.100" end="00:26:09.680" style="s2">an ontology is an ontology right it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.610" end="00:26:12.230" style="s2">neither right nor wrong it is useful or</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.680" end="00:26:16.760" style="s2">it is not useful it is it is it is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.230" end="00:26:19.910" style="s2">know it allows one to frame one&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.760" end="00:26:22.430" style="s2">in ways which make it meaningful or it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.910" end="00:26:25.340" style="s2">does not right it is only to that degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.430" end="00:26:27.980" style="s2">that an ontology is true or not true it</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.340" end="00:26:31.370" style="s2">is only ever a construct and so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.980" end="00:26:35.180" style="s2">notion of truth in the sense of some</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.370" end="00:26:37.550" style="s2">kind of permanent verifiable that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.180" end="00:26:40.580" style="s2">it just doesn&#39;t apply in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.550" end="00:26:44.180" style="s2">domain at all that that notion of being</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.580" end="00:26:47.300" style="s2">truth it feels like to me and no fucking</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.180" end="00:26:49.550" style="s2">idea that is probably though though that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.300" end="00:26:53.330" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the closest thing to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.550" end="00:26:59.180" style="s2">true ontology there is you know there</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.330" end="00:27:01.100" style="s2">are no fucking idea and and but but you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.180" end="00:27:03.430" style="s2">know we laugh but it&#39;s but it&#39;s but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.100" end="00:27:08.090" style="s2">really really really serious and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.430" end="00:27:09.800" style="s2">profound point I think to know that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.090" end="00:27:11.390" style="s2">have no fucking idea I mean this was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.800" end="00:27:13.490" style="s2">this is what the Socratic story is all</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.390" end="00:27:15.350" style="s2">about right it&#39;s that he alone actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.490" end="00:27:17.420" style="s2">knew that he had no fucking idea lots</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.350" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">and lots of clever Fortson and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.420" end="00:27:23.990" style="s2">whatever but but but actually no idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:26.210" style="s2">and but this is also dangerous right</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.990" end="00:27:27.800" style="s2">because no idea means I well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.210" end="00:27:29.090" style="s2">know anything therefore there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.800" end="00:27:32.649" style="s2">trying to know anything</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.090" end="00:27:40.070" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s equally stupid because</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.649" end="00:27:41.960" style="s2">while there is always I mean you never a</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.070" end="00:27:43.220" style="s2">hundred hundred hundred percent certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.960" end="00:27:45.350" style="s2">about anything but there are things you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.220" end="00:27:47.659" style="s2">can be sure enough of right that you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.350" end="00:27:50.450" style="s2">that you can work as though that was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.659" end="00:27:54.230" style="s2">certainty even though you have that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.450" end="00:27:57.499" style="s2">know that that little whatever so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.230" end="00:28:04.129" style="s2">again it&#39;s that it&#39;s there it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.499" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">balance thing it&#39;s that just feeling</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.129" end="00:28:17.539" style="s2">your way into what is what is right you</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:19.759" style="s2">know and and right in right is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.539" end="00:28:23.330" style="s2">one-time thing here and now right right</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.759" end="00:28:27.379" style="s2">does not exist outside of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.330" end="00:28:29.119" style="s2">right right yeah only exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.379" end="00:28:30.740" style="s2">present soon as you write it down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.119" end="00:28:32.899" style="s2">not right anymore because it was only</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.740" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">right then doesn&#39;t make it right in any</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.899" end="00:28:38.600" style="s2">other time or place or situation so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:41.080" style="s2">but nevertheless than the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.600" end="00:28:41.080" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.390" end="00:28:50.610" style="s2">feels deeply right that you know when</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:52.140" style="s2">something is right it just it just so</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.610" end="00:28:56.100" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s like a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.140" end="00:28:58.860" style="s2">alignment right that somehow be universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.100" end="00:29:01.769" style="s2">is running through you unfettered right</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.860" end="00:29:04.440" style="s2">it&#39;s laminar flow laminar flow between</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.769" end="00:29:07.049" style="s2">between in energy between you and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.440" end="00:29:09.740" style="s2">universe unperturbed as it passes</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.049" end="00:29:09.740" style="s2">through you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.330" end="00:29:27.900" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the there&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.860" end="00:29:30.270" style="s2">thing of trying to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.900" end="00:29:32.190" style="s2">world are is it not just a self</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.270" end="00:29:34.170" style="s2">referential process that all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.190" end="00:29:37.050" style="s2">actually doing is making sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.170" end="00:29:41.220" style="s2">own sense making that there is no sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.050" end="00:29:45.060" style="s2">to be made of the world in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.220" end="00:29:48.750" style="s2">real way right it&#39;s only ever making</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.060" end="00:29:50.130" style="s2">sense within the constructs which you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.750" end="00:29:51.930" style="s2">have already established as being</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.580" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">so yeah the manic is really good for</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.100" end="00:30:03.990" style="s2">this right the freedom of the an art to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:05.820" style="s2">not have to make sense and then deciding</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.990" end="00:30:14.420" style="s2">the constructs with which you are going</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.820" end="00:30:19.110" style="s2">to make sense and truth is a tightrope I</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.420" end="00:30:21.810" style="s2">know that I know nothing here&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:24.310" style="s2">because if I&#39;m in fighting a war in the</p>

<p begin="00:35:32.680" end="00:35:37.600" style="s2">committed genocide and so yeah then what</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.830" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">what what what moral</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.600" end="00:35:43.060" style="s2">you know what moral superiority do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:46.030" style="s2">now have can can war ever lead to peace</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.060" end="00:35:47.830" style="s2">or is war and it&#39;s like cigarettes right</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.030" end="00:35:49.240" style="s2">every cigarette is a chain to the next</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.830" end="00:35:51.370" style="s2">cigarette it&#39;s the same thing with war</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.240" end="00:35:53.140" style="s2">every war is a chain is a link in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.370" end="00:35:54.730" style="s2">chain to the next war kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.140" end="00:35:57.220" style="s2">to you see it&#39;s exactly that&#39;s that same</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.730" end="00:35:58.690" style="s2">kind of cycle so yeah I don&#39;t know as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.220" end="00:36:01.930" style="s2">interesting question it seems to me like</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.690" end="00:36:04.620" style="s2">that might actually be a paradox and not</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.930" end="00:36:04.620" style="s2">I&#39;m not the good kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.220" end="00:36:09.990" style="s2">the truth and lies thing the ontology</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.590" end="00:36:11.760" style="s2">only being as strong as the bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.990" end="00:36:16.340" style="s2">minds on which it&#39;s built I really like</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.760" end="00:36:20.340" style="s2">that I really like that that that feels</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.340" end="00:36:23.550" style="s2">foundationally important and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.340" end="00:36:26.220" style="s2">the ontology itself it is the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.550" end="00:36:27.090" style="s2">the substrate from which it grew is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.220" end="00:36:29.730" style="s2">important thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.090" end="00:36:32.700" style="s2">IIIi really like that but then of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.730" end="00:36:34.619" style="s2">the generation of that quality substrate</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.700" end="00:36:37.800" style="s2">requires ontology z&#39; which people buy</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.619" end="00:36:39.810" style="s2">into in order to make them fertilizers</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.800" end="00:36:42.440" style="s2">of said substrate right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.810" end="00:36:47.640" style="s2">it&#39;s another one of those cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.440" end="00:36:53.820" style="s2">processes the truth and lies truth and</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.640" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">lies that the the the most disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.820" end="00:37:00.840" style="s2">part of this is not even that people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:03.570" style="s2">easily deceived but they actually in</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.840" end="00:37:06.869" style="s2">many don&#39;t actually care about the truth</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.570" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">anymore the truth is only something to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.869" end="00:37:11.940" style="s2">appear to be in order to you know make</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:13.260" style="s2">an argument or win an advantage or</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.940" end="00:37:15.930" style="s2">something like where that whether it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.260" end="00:37:18.510" style="s2">actually true or not is is is is is of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.930" end="00:37:22.770" style="s2">no real importance the notion of truth</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.510" end="00:37:27.780" style="s2">is now a thing to be beaten with rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.770" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">than a process of discovery and uncover</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.349" end="00:45:19.660" style="s2">Wars are really interesting I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.109" end="00:45:23.199" style="s2">thinking about it a bit recently in</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.660" end="00:45:26.380" style="s2">response to something and apart from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.199" end="00:45:29.469" style="s2">bloodlust which there is undeniably a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.380" end="00:45:31.809" style="s2">part of us which can be pulled out which</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.469" end="00:45:36.819" style="s2">revels in the bloodlust they did</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.809" end="00:45:39.489" style="s2">undeniably it is there but i i&#39;ve wonder</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.819" end="00:45:42.489" style="s2">whether that is actually the main appeal</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.489" end="00:45:47.009" style="s2">of war and the fighting to the death and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.489" end="00:45:50.109" style="s2">whether it&#39;s not more to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.009" end="00:45:53.439" style="s2">single-mindedness of purpose that war</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.109" end="00:45:56.890" style="s2">brings about in the psyche the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.439" end="00:45:59.619" style="s2">willingness to sacrifice everything for</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.890" end="00:46:02.650" style="s2">a particular goal that you put above all</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.619" end="00:46:06.150" style="s2">else right even your life the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.650" end="00:46:09.519" style="s2">more important than your life the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.150" end="00:46:12.069" style="s2">willingness to endure great hardship in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.519" end="00:46:17.199" style="s2">service of something which is bigger</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.069" end="00:46:21.159" style="s2">than you I just wonder if this is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.199" end="00:46:25.380" style="s2">the actual appeal of war is that it in</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.159" end="00:46:27.669" style="s2">in a way it is only those extreme</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.380" end="00:46:30.729" style="s2">circumstances which are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.669" end="00:46:33.759" style="s2">bringing out the the truly most noble</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.729" end="00:46:38.859" style="s2">depths of ourselves convert you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.759" end="00:46:40.659" style="s2">perversely is it&#39;s really not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.859" end="00:46:46.859" style="s2">there&#39;s any mileage in this idea but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.659" end="00:46:53.429" style="s2">but it does strike me and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.859" end="00:46:56.769" style="s2">if there was some way to access that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.429" end="00:47:01.029" style="s2">state of mind that degree of focus that</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.769" end="00:47:02.709" style="s2">degree of absolute involvement in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.029" end="00:47:04.989" style="s2">thing that you are doing right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.709" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">full participate or involvement your</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.989" end="00:47:12.239" style="s2">willingness to give your life for it</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:16.599" style="s2">whether if that could somehow be</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.239" end="00:47:18.490" style="s2">harnessed without the explosions and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.599" end="00:47:22.119" style="s2">guns and the chemicals and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.490" end="00:47:27.460" style="s2">viruses and the nuclear radiation and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.119" end="00:47:31.780" style="s2">the you know a destruction of everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.460" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">if somehow there were games which were</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.780" end="00:47:40.900" style="s2">so cool and so intense and so involving</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:43.090" style="s2">that they brought us that without having</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.900" end="00:47:46.170" style="s2">would that be enough would that would</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.090" end="00:47:50.380" style="s2">that be enough to slake our first for</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.170" end="00:47:56.710" style="s2">warfare or is the bloodlust to part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.380" end="00:47:58.390" style="s2">it and if so then yeah the gladiators is</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.710" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">a good one you could scale it down I</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.390" end="00:48:02.760" style="s2">mean as I understand it this was this</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:05.590" style="s2">was what was done back in the day when</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.760" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">individual you know when when the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.590" end="00:48:08.290" style="s2">numbers in your tribe were really</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:10.020" style="s2">important you couldn&#39;t afford to lose</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.290" end="00:48:12.910" style="s2">people if you did go to war then each</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.020" end="00:48:15.310" style="s2">tribe or each group would send one</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.910" end="00:48:17.260" style="s2">champion right and the champions would</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.310" end="00:48:19.240" style="s2">would have it out and the winner won and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.260" end="00:48:21.610" style="s2">the loser lost and that was it and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.240" end="00:48:25.810" style="s2">know there&#39;s only one person died in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.610" end="00:48:28.119" style="s2">conflict and yeah and so does that</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.810" end="00:48:30.460" style="s2">satisfy the need for bloodlust if one</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.119" end="00:48:32.080" style="s2">person from the group goes and fights to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.460" end="00:48:36.850" style="s2">the death against somebody else we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.100" end="00:48:46.140" style="s2">right does that that or is that just</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.670" end="00:48:50.020" style="s2">feeding the monster and making it worse</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.140" end="00:48:53.800" style="s2">it&#39;s so hard to know it&#39;s so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.020" end="00:48:58.570" style="s2">know that tangentially related you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.800" end="00:49:00.700" style="s2">is it okay to make pedo porn using CGI</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.570" end="00:49:02.770" style="s2">right and let P dough&#39;s have that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.700" end="00:49:04.510" style="s2">went to that so that they can slake</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.770" end="00:49:08.170" style="s2">their thirst or does that just make</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.510" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">their hunger for real children more</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.540" end="00:49:18.520" style="s2">kinds of questions experimentation needs</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.910" end="00:49:21.730" style="s2">to be done there needs to be the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.520" end="00:49:24.340" style="s2">to ask these questions and say hey we</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.730" end="00:49:27.130" style="s2">don&#39;t know let&#39;s try it let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.340" end="00:49:30.580" style="s2">happens when we do it with people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.130" end="00:49:32.500" style="s2">are fully willing to engage in the</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.990" end="00:49:44.890" style="s2">that has been coming up again and again</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.180" end="00:49:48.220" style="s2">and again in all kinds of different</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.890" end="00:49:50.620" style="s2">contexts that actually nothing means</p>
