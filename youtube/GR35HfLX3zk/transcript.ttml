<p begin="00:00:34.020" end="00:00:38.790" style="s2">happening in 2028 when we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.230" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">creating the technology cooperative for</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.790" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">a decade together what is possible and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">what we created by 2028 in the parallel</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:48.270" style="s2">timeline where we started this in 2018</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">and were able to create it will happen</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.270" end="00:00:54.539" style="s2">within a decade of eliminating poverty</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">and having global world peace so today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.539" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">topic is the food system and what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">food system looks like in 2028 and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">amazing but also hard to explain like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">imagine explaining the food system today</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">to your grandmother as a child like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">very complex and like right we packaged</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">food and this happens and Amazon can</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:21.570" style="s2">deliver it and so I&#39;m gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">like that in 2028 there are if you live</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:28.590" style="s2">in an in a city there are a plethora of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">systems to opt into so based on your</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:33.869" style="s2">diet choices based on what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:36.710" style="s2">contribute to the group how many hours</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.869" end="00:01:41.270" style="s2">you want to spend on your food is how</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.710" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">gourmet the food is is how much human</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.270" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">involvement was required to grow the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">food so there are people like Steve for</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:53.729" style="s2">instance who in 2028 is a slow food</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">movement person and wants and is working</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.729" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">with a tiny group of 12 other people</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">they live on the land they spend tons of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">time growing their own food biodynamic</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2">way and harvesting it and cooking it</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">together I mean each individual spends</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">on average 30 hours a week creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">their food that&#39;s definitely not for</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:13.990" style="s2">everybody there&#39;s then Mary and she</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:17.230" style="s2">likes she has a busy life in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.990" end="00:02:18.940" style="s2">city and she wants to be able to get her</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.230" end="00:02:21.010" style="s2">food as efficiently as possible so she</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.940" end="00:02:22.870" style="s2">opts into the Syst the citywide system</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.010" end="00:02:24.280" style="s2">that&#39;s that feeds a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.870" end="00:02:26.710" style="s2">people and so she only has to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.280" end="00:02:28.630" style="s2">four hours a week and seventy dollars</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.710" end="00:02:33.430" style="s2">and she gets all the food prepared for</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.630" end="00:02:34.870" style="s2">her that is that is very automated its</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.430" end="00:02:36.790" style="s2">automated so that there is less human</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.870" end="00:02:38.380" style="s2">time and it&#39;s also like there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.790" end="00:02:39.910" style="s2">options to choose from a day and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.380" end="00:02:42.010" style="s2">pick it for the month in it delivers it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.910" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">to you that day and you are inputting</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.010" end="00:02:51.310" style="s2">your share of the labor costs there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:54.370" style="s2">community tools for people who live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.310" end="00:02:55.960" style="s2">areas that aren&#39;t big cities or our big</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.370" end="00:02:57.880" style="s2">cities but are in location three</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.960" end="00:03:00.160" style="s2">counties that grow food so in Canada we</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.880" end="00:03:04.240" style="s2">have a lot of northern communities that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.160" end="00:03:06.430" style="s2">have really astronomical food like their</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.240" end="00:03:08.740" style="s2">food costs are really high in 2019 so</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.430" end="00:03:10.570" style="s2">they are able to say okay we created</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.740" end="00:03:11.980" style="s2">this whole system by asking very simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.570" end="00:03:14.770" style="s2">questions like what are you currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.980" end="00:03:17.560" style="s2">doing for food helping people track that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.770" end="00:03:19.090" style="s2">and then offering them the tools to come</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.560" end="00:03:20.980" style="s2">together and create solutions together</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.090" end="00:03:22.930" style="s2">so northern communities were able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.980" end="00:03:26.020" style="s2">create their own greenhouses using and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.930" end="00:03:27.670" style="s2">solar-powered indoor growing 3d growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.020" end="00:03:29.290" style="s2">so that they could have fresh prudent</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.670" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">produce all year round it didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.290" end="00:03:32.650" style="s2">make sense to have far means they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:34.900" style="s2">still be astronomical prices for milk or</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.650" end="00:03:37.270" style="s2">they brought milk under their diet that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.900" end="00:03:38.620" style="s2">there&#39;s they don&#39;t have problem freezing</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.270" end="00:03:41.170" style="s2">their food so they were able to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.620" end="00:03:43.450" style="s2">meat available but milk was a little a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.170" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">little weird to freeze powdered milk and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.450" end="00:03:47.590" style="s2">such there&#39;s places different solutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:50.260" style="s2">work in different places so to be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.590" end="00:03:51.790" style="s2">to to assess that and say what works</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.260" end="00:03:53.290" style="s2">best in your northern community and not</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.790" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">this is what&#39;s gonna work and you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.290" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">to use it giving them the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:58.870" style="s2">decide together and then offering them</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:00.280" style="s2">funding and offering them ways that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.870" end="00:04:02.380" style="s2">can implement it right away</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.280" end="00:04:04.420" style="s2">same with every village around the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.380" end="00:04:06.520" style="s2">to be able to say what&#39;s gonna work for</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.420" end="00:04:08.260" style="s2">you to feed your village how can you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.520" end="00:04:09.940" style="s2">come together as a village so that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.260" end="00:04:11.620" style="s2">all don&#39;t have to individually solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.940" end="00:04:12.940" style="s2">your own problems by figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.620" end="00:04:14.530" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna buy rice for that day for</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.940" end="00:04:16.600" style="s2">your family and then cook it over your</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.580" end="00:04:25.270" style="s2">and cook one big pot of rice then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.419" end="00:04:27.410" style="s2">already saving time money resources just</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.270" end="00:04:29.330" style="s2">doing that then the money in tiniest</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.640" end="00:04:42.860" style="s2">massive scale we just like unleashed</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.150" end="00:04:44.600" style="s2">innovation so anyone who comes up with</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.480" end="00:04:51.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s one-size-fits-all food</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:55.400" style="s2">is definitely not one-size-fits-all</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.170" end="00:05:17.630" style="s2">people or you have food delivered</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.610" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">because you&#39;re not eating with community</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.900" end="00:05:25.880" style="s2">or you it&#39;s all available to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:28.130" style="s2">very organized and it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.880" end="00:05:30.200" style="s2">efficient possible we have our own where</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.130" end="00:05:32.060" style="s2">there is processed food we&#39;ve created it</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.200" end="00:05:33.380" style="s2">ourselves because we&#39;ve looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.060" end="00:05:35.060" style="s2">threshold of like right it&#39;s making</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.210" end="00:05:42.140" style="s2">and we can do it on a massive scale so</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.310" end="00:05:44.510" style="s2">at what point does it make sense to bulk</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.140" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">create our pasta sauce and at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.510" end="00:05:49.850" style="s2">threshold we created pasta sauce company</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:53.390" style="s2">and we sell it at cost of the labor of</p>
