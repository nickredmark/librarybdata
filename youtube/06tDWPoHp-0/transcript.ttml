<p begin="00:00:22.590" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">because I don&#39;t even know how to clean</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.730" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">it up it&#39;s like under the seat and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">on the way home like I&#39;ll treat myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">to a coffee there was parking spots but</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:37.140" style="s2">I had already passed them so I pulled up</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">a couple blocks and walked back to one</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.140" end="00:00:41.850" style="s2">of the coffee shops and it&#39;s closed to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:43.350" style="s2">close down like two months ago which I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.850" end="00:00:45.329" style="s2">figured out right before I got there</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">like at the crosswalk to go up to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.329" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">across the street and then my grocery</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">shopping they don&#39;t have coffee grinders</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">there so I can buy the coffee in bulk</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:57.930" style="s2">but I can&#39;t grind it I do have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">coffee left so I&#39;m going to go and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.930" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">have that right after because I don&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">much need it for the mornings like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">mean I&#39;m awake it&#39;s ten o&#39;clock I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:10.140" style="s2">need it to wake up but I do need it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">because I had a caffeine headache in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:14.630" style="s2">afternoon late afternoon if I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">had coffee yet I did manage to go out</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.630" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">off of coffee a few months ago and dealt</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">with the headaches and the bitchiness</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">for days and then somehow I went back on</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">coffee cuz it&#39;s delicious</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">so I kind of have to either pick either</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">completely off or completely on and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">guess I could have decaf coffee but</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">what&#39;s the point in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:35.430" style="s2">do you cup coffee stay off of it no such</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">as that odd morning where I do really</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.430" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">need a pick-me-up the next anti cup of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:40.530" style="s2">coffee</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">I&#39;m just a morning person if I could</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.530" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">have coffee in the afternoon maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:52.549" style="s2">could function but yeah that was my mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:54.930" style="s2">a plus I got I noticed I&#39;ve been off of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.549" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">off on disability and not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.930" end="00:01:59.490" style="s2">work full time I paid my bills up until</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">like the last month I wasn&#39;t able to and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.490" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">then food and shelter became a priority</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">so I stopped paying my credit card bills</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">as I would suggest everyone to do and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">just find the creditor so weird I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:10.990" style="s2">this was three and a half years ago that</p>
