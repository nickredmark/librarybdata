<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">that is pervasive throughout psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">which is that psychology has no unified</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.120" style="s2">throughout this we will be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">some of the most important philosophical</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what we&#39;re arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">here in this discussion that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.720" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">i i&#39;ll share that greg enriquez here and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">uh i had a moment of inspiration i wrote</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">you realize that we&#39;re dialoguing about</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:22.720" style="s2">the ontology of mind in a socratic</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:25.360" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.720" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">to usher in a new way of doing academic</p>

<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">uh i i think with that that intersection</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">that made me really excited about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">project so thank you john for</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">this uh set of insights and at so many</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">different levels it&#39;s very very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:38.799" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:40.479" style="s2">well thank you greg i mean your</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.799" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">partnership is and your friendship</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">as your your vast uh reading and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">relevant expertise</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">um none of these things that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">proposing and that&#39;s what they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">are are proposed as well of course this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:56.479" style="s2">is the case</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">this is the hardest the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">thing we&#39;re trying to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">and so um doing it in a in a socratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.200" style="s2">situation i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">is uh most uh the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.200" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">intellectually ethical way we can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">responsible</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">uh to the material and to the people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">might be listening</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">so last time we were taking a look i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">presenting</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">so following on the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">importance of problem formulation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">spending a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">before trying to solve the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">just say what consciousness is or</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.840" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of that already i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">proposing and greg is helping me</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">that we go through and really try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">formulate the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">modern problem of consciousness as</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">clearly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">um and towards that end</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing greg are you still there</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">yeah yeah no i&#39;m just i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">enraptured set it up</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">so towards the end um what i proposed we</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">do is take a look</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">at um the arguments that are generally</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">considered to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">uh the classical presentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">what i&#39;ve been arguing is that uh and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">these arguments</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">emerge within the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">and they emerge around the pivotal</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">figure of descartes</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">and what i&#39;ve been trying to argue is we</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">need to get that historical</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">formulation of the problem very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">in hand</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">before we then proceed uh to try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">unravel that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">and then greg has been making uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">valuable insightful connections not only</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">is he giving me feedback on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">proposals</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">he&#39;s in addition making valuable</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">insightful connections to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">the problem that he sees central he sees</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">it of course as related to this problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">the untying the world not</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">but the problem that is typified in his</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">uh tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">and um next time uh or possibly the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">after that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">uh greg is going to take the burden of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">leading us through</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">presentation as he wrestles with and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">hopefully i can be as helpful to him as</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">he has been to me wrestles with how this</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">problematic given to us by descartes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">has translated into what he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s sort of that&#39;s sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">we&#39;re going so today i want to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">with greg&#39;s help i want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">finish out the argument so last time we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:19.040" style="s2">took a look at an argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">by descartes that basically and now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.040" end="00:04:23.160" style="s2">not going to try and make the argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not going to i please don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.160" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">accumulating i</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">i really uh last time tried to present</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">descartes argument in detail and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">carefully</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">so this is now just a summary right</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">baker descartes is basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">well if you take a look at mind and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:39.199" style="s2">matter um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">you know there are two kinds of stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">seem to share any properties uh oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">let&#39;s do it the other way around when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">take a look at the properties of mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">and matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t seem to share any kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">properties what the properties that seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2">to be central to mine</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">are not possessed in matter and vice</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">versa and so that leads into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">conclusion that there are radically two</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">and then i pointed out that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">argument is techno</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">technically not valid um and then i</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">pointed out an attempt to try</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">properties of mind and matter to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">essential properties of mind and matter</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">also doesn&#39;t turn out to be um</p>

<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">and then what that leaves us with is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">um the question of why is the argument</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">so influential if it&#39;s technically not</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">valid</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">and what i argued was is that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">was actually using</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">a form of argumentation that is central</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">to all of science which is inference to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">the best explanation</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">and then if you put descartes proposal</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">for dualism</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">into competition with the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">contenders at that time</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:43.440" style="s2">his proposal does the best so the one</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">the most prominent contender is of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">uh the aristotelian worldview but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">scientific revolution is leading that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">worldview into collapse</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">and and whereas descartes view seems to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">directly um in sync with the emerging</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">because he what his view does is remove</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">a lot of the problematic aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">from the world and put them in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">therefore leaving the world free</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">uh to uh to a more mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">and mechanical explanation he then um</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">also what he does is he then comes to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">see the mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">almost exclusively in terms of its</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">the mind becomes a purely uh</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">because the old job of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">and the aristotelian worldview of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">actualizing life</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">into agency and coupling us to the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">has been lost uh in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:47.919" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">and then descartes view is also in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.919" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">competition with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">the late renaissance right uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">neoplatonic magicians</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.360" style="s2">um i&#39;m not invoking anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:07:00.319" style="s2">supernatural here but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.360" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">perhaps the best way and they were very</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.319" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">interested in things that are now</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">central to the emerging analysis of mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:08.680" style="s2">they were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">actionable distance real relations</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.680" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">and then descartes and one wing of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">catholic church sort of ally together</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:20.160" style="s2">because they want that uh approach</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">to mind and life and reality completely</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.160" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">discredited and marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">uh because it it presents a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">significant</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">threat to the christian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:32.720" style="s2">and so what remains therefore is a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">of matter and a new notion of causation</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">matter is no longer pure potentiality</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">like it was for aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">matter is in actuality but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">act it&#39;s single act is the act of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">raw resistance it is inert it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">inertial</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">it has no inner structure no inner</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">dynamic quality</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">it is in no way teleological uh and all</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">of the causation</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">has now collapsed into uh mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">where these inert things smash into each</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">other and bump into each other</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">given that scientific world view</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">cartesian dualism</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">can out compete both uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">thus the declining uh aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">it can help to marginalize the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">neoplatonic magical view</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">and therefore best align</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">align itself with the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">scientific revolution really and what i</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:31.800" style="s2">was therefore trying to show was</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">the scientific worldview and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.800" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">problematization of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">go hand in hand not because that not not</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">because of an</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">initially antagonistic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">people often now</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">oh but consciousness and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">it was actually caught it was it was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">that originally gave us this dualistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">picture of mine</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">the dualistic picture of mine is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">some new</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">radical way to respond to the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">science has dropped</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">you know emptied the world of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">meaning and mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">it was actually generated by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">scientific revolution by one of its</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">premier representatives which is daycare</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s the first argument anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">you want to comment on that greg</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">yeah so so i i think that the reason we</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">want to do problem formulation here</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">from my vantage point and i think from</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">john&#39;s also is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">not only do we want to get a frame but</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">we also want to understand that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">inheriting the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">i mean at least our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">inheriting the grammar of this history</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">what i would call this history of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">justification uh this history of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:35.920" style="s2">narrative sense making</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">uh that we are a part of and the way in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.920" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">which our grammar functions so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">why it&#39;s so crucial</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">both for problem formation and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">understand kind of where we are and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">people tend to use language around these</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">terms so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s one point as to why i want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">echo why this is so super crucial</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">the other thing i will say is that i i</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">i&#39;m going to be trailing this uh through</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">the more the matter in motion mentality</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">okay um which is galileo uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">and certainly in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">descartes but galileo into newton</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">and one thing i&#39;ll simply say is galileo</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">i think i might have mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:13.360" style="s2">before but i&#39;ll simply reiterate</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">galileo hates aristotle&#39;s metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.360" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s getting abused</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">in a particular way so he cuts off form</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">final causation um and formal causation</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">and leaves behind uh substance and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">efficient or kinetic causation</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">so when john&#39;s doing this okay this</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">is in part also what galileo&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">when he&#39;s watching matter in motion</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">all right and then you have descartes</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">and galileo both really</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">catholic church will sort of come to a</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">i do agree with that i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">excellent so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">why is what what&#39;s so okay so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">wrong with descartes winning</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">um you know what what&#39;s wrong with all</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">and picking up on the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">galileo and descartes galileo divides</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">you know all of the properties all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">the qualities into two kinds</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">the mathematical ones uh which are</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">primary are taken to be objectively real</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">and then all the non-mathematical ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">are taken to exist only in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">those are the secondary qualities and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">they are now the philosophers now refer</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:55.760" style="s2">to that with the abbreviated term qualia</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">and and they only exist in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.760" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">because they don&#39;t exist in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">um and so why is all why is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">cartesian dualism problematic</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">and especially why like what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">with consciousness being an immaterial</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">substance etc and all that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">the problem with that is while descartes</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">sort of wins all</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">the argumentative battles he and i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">this is something that uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">greg does excellent work on he loses we</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">all know he&#39;s losing</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">the experiential existential battle uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">i mean it is readily apparent to me that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">a profound intimacy and interpenetration</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">in my experience of mind and matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">if descartes was right mind can in no</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">way move</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">matter it has no physical energy it has</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">no inertial properties it has no</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.200" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">material resistance</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no way mine can bang into any</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">material part of my brain so how is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">that my desire</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">to pick up my watch actually ends up in</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">the physical movement</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">of my watch like and then the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:01.720" style="s2">how is it the material events i&#39;ll lead</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.720" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">particularly uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">mental event within consciousness pain</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">this is the problem that descartes has</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">and this is not something oh no</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">everybody around descartes including</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">descartes realizes that this</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">is a profound problem and it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">a profound problem because people</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">are convinced by descartes arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">we&#39;ve just reviewed the first one</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">and yet they can&#39;t deny</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">the overwhelming like</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:35.920" style="s2">evidence for mind-body interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">and again mind to mind interaction</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.920" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">because the only way i can pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">greg</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">right is there&#39;s photons coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">my tv screen it&#39;s a material event</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:46.399" style="s2">and somehow that has a causal chain and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">that if that causal chain</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.399" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">is all physical and it never can reach</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">the purely</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">immaterial mind that he possesses</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">then i can&#39;t actually ever know his mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">and and this has of course horrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">because if you think and we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">to this later you think that animals</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">don&#39;t possess consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">um then of course there&#39;s nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">with you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">doing live uh dissections of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:12.310" style="s2">because it&#39;s no different</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.839" style="s2">than a bell ringing and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.310" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.839" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">so and then you know uh there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">untoward consequences and and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">as i said uh greg is going to show how</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:26.399" style="s2">those ramify</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">uh through uh the history of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.199" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">have become as he&#39;s already indicated</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">woven into the very grammar by which we</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">talk about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">and by which we pursue therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">relief of our distress</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">this is how profound this problem is</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.440" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">this is how very you can&#39;t say oh well</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">who cares about the philosophy i get it</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">in one sense but in another sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">and i think greg is deeply right about</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">this this gets into the guts of your</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">and your attempts to understand yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">and alleviate any distress you might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">undergoing etc</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">excellent all right so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">argument descartes has three</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re all influential and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">all part of the problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">and any attempt to address the world not</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">has to address all three of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">arguments to be satisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s the second argument the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">second argument is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">an argument around comparative realness</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">and descartes follows</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">a long-standing tradition and that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">it&#39;s even sort of presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">and nicholas maxwell has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:34.800" style="s2">this within science of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2">and it goes back to promenities that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.800" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">realness is sort of measured</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">uh by intelligibility how much sense we</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">can make of something how</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">uh and and this is why we think of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">things like um</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">equals mc squared as profoundly real</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">because we can explain so much it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">renders so much of the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">intelligible it must be deeply real and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s a deep connection between</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">realness and intelligibility so then</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">descartes basically makes an</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">argument which goes along the following</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">lines</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">the intelligibility of the body is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">asymmetrically dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">intelligibility of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">which means the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">by this argument inherently more real</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">than the body</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">and differences in realness are</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">we are differences in kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">so so the difference betw right is our</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">differences in kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">so let&#39;s give a concrete example uh of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">one board from descartes and you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">think of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">the movie the matrix about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">thing uh daycard says</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">well i can be dreaming that i have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t and in that dream that body</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">is not and here&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">word it&#39;s not real that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">that right that i can only actually make</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">sense of that body</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">by having a more direct</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">intelligibility a direct awareness of my</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">own mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">so this is where the kagito ergo sum of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">descartes comes in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">so essentially this is the very famous i</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">think therefore i am</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">which every freshman will tell you is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">not an argument like that that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">argument that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">the conclusion doesn&#39;t follow for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">premise like what what the hell right uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">what descartes means is and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">about this remember what we had with</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">aristotle was a contact epistemology a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">conformity</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">uh epistemology uh and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">what descartes says is the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">the mind is now in conformity with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">only thing that participates in</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">is itself and and that is a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">you know your consciousness by being</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">conscious and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">the mind has a direct awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">itself it is directly intelligible to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">it cannot doubt its own realness</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">for you to say i think my consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">is an illusion is like what</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">like right what does that that means no</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">sense so for descartes</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">well it is reasonable to entertain</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">the possibility that your body is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">illusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">it is not equally reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">entertain the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">that your mind is an illusion so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">very possible that your body is only an</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">illusion</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">and therefore it is less real</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">than your mind and secondly how do i</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">know about my body and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">i want to call into question later but</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">this is descartes argument</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">well i start from the mind&#39;s direct</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">awareness of itself and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">the events in my mind and then i infer</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">that i have a body i infer that i have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">body and that inference of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">is a kind of abductive inductive</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">inference</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">and that means it&#39;s potentially fallible</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">the dream example shows you that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">and so descartes says</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">the realness of the mind is inferior to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">and completely dependent on the realness</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">of the body</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">and therefore the mind and the body must</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">be two kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">different kinds of things in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">in order to give a good explanation</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">for why we have this suck this this</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">huge difference in realness so first of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">all how does that argument</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">uh how&#39;s that yeah i think that very</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">important when you make the freshman</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">comment so let&#39;s make a distinction here</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">and i think you do this actually in your</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">course which i found to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">dead-on and i hadn&#39;t actually formulated</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">this way so in terms of logic</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">you know aristotle aristotelian logic</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">deductive argument</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">i think therefore i am is not great okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">but at the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:41.120" style="s2">phenomenological level of being</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very powerful argument you</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.120" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">know it really</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">really is it and and it is the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">within the dream</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">the evil demon dream argument um or even</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">a you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">that gets materialized and modern things</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">does allow us to basically be like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">nonsensical psychologically to say oh i</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">wonder if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">awake you know or if i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">experiencing this that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">that quickly so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.559" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">or phenomenologically psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">compelling uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">experience uh to have that uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">frame so i just wanted to echo that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">emphasize that well that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:23.039" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect that that fills in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">missing premise in the argument i want</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.039" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">so notice what&#39;s happening with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">what grape just said</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">right the the the we regard it as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">rational conviction but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">following from</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">uh deductive or logical argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:38.559" style="s2">it&#39;s fall and this is descartes point</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">it&#39;s following from</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.559" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">a direct conformity of the mind with</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">itself a direct phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">now that is very interesting because now</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">descartes is actually slipped</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">something in that is going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">problematic because he&#39;s given us</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.280" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">two different ways by which we establish</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">intelligible realness and therefore two</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">different standards</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">by which we evaluate if things are real</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">one is the standard that follows from</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">logical mathematical argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">therefore says</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">the mathematical the mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">realized properties</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">are the most real the primary qualities</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:17.440" style="s2">so the objective mathematical properties</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s most real but then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.440" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">given us another argument that goes from</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">moves from a completely different base</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:26.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not a logical argument</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">at least initially it&#39;s a direct</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.280" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">phenomenological experience which says</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">no no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">this direct awareness i have of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">realness of my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:36.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s most real and everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">else has a derived</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.559" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">reality from that really and now you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">you what descartes has done in his</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">argument for dualism</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">again these very these very convincing</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">arguments for dualism</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">and this is an important component of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">the mind consciousness problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">is that he has rendered our normative</p>

<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:05.039" style="s2">about realness perpetually unstable</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">because we can always set these off</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.039" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">against each other and you can then see</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">psychology and philosophy in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:12.400" style="s2">would argue</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">the whole intellectual history of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.400" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">west since descartes</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">is constantly vacillating between these</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">two different normative strategies</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">and types of claims for what&#39;s real you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">can either say no no</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">oh sorry greg you&#39;re doing i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">gonna really quick so when we start it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">off we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get a much differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">picture of mental processes that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">of where we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">so remember phenomenologically this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">mind two</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">okay and then mind three is getting into</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:42.960" style="s2">justificatory rationality</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">right so i just want to highlight that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.960" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">blend actually is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">differentiated when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">uh get to the end of our puzzle making</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">thank you greg thank you for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">okay so what what&#39;s the vacillation i</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">was talking about well what we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">we can we can go basic</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">we can uh you know we can be sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">realist</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">of some kind and we can say you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">what&#39;s ultimately real and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">hammer on things material things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">objective mathematically and everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">else is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">so nearly subjective merely an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">and then and then other people say what</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.919" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">you know my the my subjective awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">of my own consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">is the most real thing there is to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">is could just be an illusion or a dream</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">and then you move towards idealism</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">and then of course and and like many</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">other people i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">um that kind of idealism is a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">alternative</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">because you get into problems around</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">solipsism and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">deep history and i think berkeley</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">basically shows that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:53.520" style="s2">that kind of idealism uh requires</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">like a god to explain why things are</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">persisting outside of our awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">and then you&#39;re in the you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">situation of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">your your your model of mind depends on</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">establish independently establishing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">existence of god</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">and my response to that is well good</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">luck with that good luck with that right</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">and what i will also say in a nod to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">your future</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">is that we&#39;re gonna want a system that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">shows how these</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">domains participate in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">in some sort of transactional kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:29.679" style="s2">exactly exactly that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s very well said the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.679" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.960" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">a kind of uh trenchant materialism</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">and a trench in subjectivism idealism is</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">they ultimately don&#39;t explain the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">that descartes has left us which which</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">is the deep inter-penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">participatory relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:51.679" style="s2">between in mind and body while they do</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">our adopt-reductive strategies</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.679" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">of arguing that one of the two poles is</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">somehow an</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">illusion which is as greg is nodding is</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">just to fall prey to the very cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">grammar</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">that needs to be challenged that needs</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:06.159" style="s2">to be challenged because that grammar if</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">you&#39;re if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.159" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">if you follow it consistently is not</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">going to give you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">a stable account of realness and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">and the history that&#39;s come out of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">i think is good evidence</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">for the claim i&#39;m making and i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">greg is not into</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">and so what that does is i i think it</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">tells us that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">any account of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">mind that has the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">of rendering our ability to judge</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:38.120" style="s2">realness</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">unstable and non-viable is ultimately a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.120" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">self-defeating</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">account of mind amen</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">especially if we can get an inductive to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:50.480" style="s2">a best explanation that doesn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that problem that would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.480" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">perfectly good</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">okay so i take it that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">and so when we talk about this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">i mean that that that that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">disputes</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">that have keep going back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">between our culture</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">um they all are in dispute with each</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.400" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">precisely because they share this common</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">um around mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">and realness etc okay so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">second argument which means</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">any attempt to unravel the world not has</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">to not only</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">you&#39;re now going to see why this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">getting to be a hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not only going to deal with well</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">what do we do how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">do that while maintaining all of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve got from the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">because the two</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">right this model of mind and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">scientific revolution are interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">that&#39;s hard enough but now we add in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.919" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">second thing well you know while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">in order to address the mind body</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">problem you need to break out of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">grammar and stabilize what realness is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s a pretty hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty hard problem too um okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">so now the third argument from descartes</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">oh greg do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">say anything before i move to the third</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">argument no is this where we get into</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">hobbes and uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">yeah exactly that&#39;s right perfect yep</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">nope that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:17.440" style="s2">i was thinking and then that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">bring us into</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.440" end="00:27:24.240" style="s2">a more specifically properly</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">psychological theory i would say a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.240" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">theory of mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">a theory of cognition that is more</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">mathematically experimentally um</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">open to examination that&#39;s what hops</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">so hobbes takes a look at what descartes</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">has done</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:46.320" style="s2">and he&#39;s deeply like everybody they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">contemporaries</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.320" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">yeah yeah and hobbes even writes to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">descartes um</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">descartes is not very nice to hobbes um</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">because where you know hobbs</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">is brilliant but hobbes is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">mathematician and descartes knows that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">and so he has contempt for hobbes in</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">that uh in that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">um but descartes is also a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">uh courtier the way he responds to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">princess elizabeth who</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">sometimes says some not brilliant things</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">she sometimes says really good things</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">too but sometimes she says things but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">he&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">oh you&#39;re so brilliant and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">blah so they are contemporaries</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:23.840" style="s2">um but hobbes notices what descartes is</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">and he says well look well you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken away all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">causation all the other jobs that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">mind used to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">and it has one job and one job alone now</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a purely</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">epistemic engine and that and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">epistemic engine</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:44.559" style="s2">that operates in a purely mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">manner what it does it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.559" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">epistemic engine</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">a machine for coming up with knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">that and that&#39;s the all it does it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do any of that actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">any of that embedding any of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">contact with the world it&#39;s not doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">any of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">right it&#39;s just manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">mathematical representations in order to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">come up</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">with the most certain account</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">of the world and that&#39;s all it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">and then hobbes looks at that he says</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">the you know the purely mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">sorry the purely mechanical manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">logical manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">of uh mathematical propositions well</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">that&#39;s just computation</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">that&#39;s just computation and so he</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">actually says</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">uh this is a direct quote by wrathios a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:34.799" style="s2">nation which is an old term for</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">cognition i mean computation he</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:38.880" style="s2">advocates the idea that cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">computation</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.880" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">people think this is a radical new idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">that came out of you know the computer</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:48.640" style="s2">um no it was revised but hobbes</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">proposes it you see how the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.640" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">computational model of mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">is actually one of the first children of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">and so bob&#39;s proposes this and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">hobbes does something</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">really radical with it he says you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">we can get rid of all of this cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">problem uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">because if cognition is computation</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">well look around because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">happening they already have they already</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.880" style="s2">have machines</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">you know very primitive by higher</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.880" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">standards that are capable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">addition</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">right calculation and some of the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">automatons</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:26.880" style="s2">and they were were being made and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">were right like a mechanical duck</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.880" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember where that comes around</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">but that&#39;s a classic</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">these are the these are the talk of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">european civilization</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">and so hobbs says well can i make uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">something like uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">an automated abacus that can do</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">a purely mechanical form of computation</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">and if it&#39;s doing computation</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">then it&#39;s cognitive and then i&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">mind and then i don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">about all this</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">immaterial substance and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">stuff and what i have is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">a purely computational account of mine</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">a very current proposal strong ai</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">wrong ai strong ai exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">now what&#39;s descartes argument so</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">descartes third argument is basically a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">series of responses</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">to hobbs and we have to note this now</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:18.159" style="s2">it&#39;s tempting to think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">is going to do is what sort of going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.159" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">invoke you know religious ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:22.880" style="s2">the soul and immortality</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">in order to try and refute hubs but he</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.880" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t do that at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">what he does is he says hobbes you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">idiot</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">because your model of mind is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">consistent with the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">eckhart actually within his historical</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">makes scientific arguments against</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">bob&#39;s proposal what are the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">those arguments</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">well he says well and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">descartes says well what do we what do</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">we need to presuppose</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">is going on in people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">doing science</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">what do we need to say about their</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">cognition well their reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">okay well what is it to reason well he</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">well reasoning depends on the meanings</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">and the scientific revolution and with</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">the destruction</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">of the aristotelian worldview says there</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">is no meaning in things</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">meaning isn&#39;t a mathematical extended</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">material inertial thing meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">in the mind it&#39;s not a property of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:32.000" style="s2">so hobbes how could you possibly</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">manipulate matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">and get meaning out of it you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">paying attention to the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">revolution matter is inert</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">it has no tediology to it it has no</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">internal dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">all it does is accidentally hit other</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">chunks of matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">there is no way you can get meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">out of matter and then aligned with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">he says</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">notice when i&#39;m reasoning i&#39;m reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">in terms of what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">but truth is a function of meaning i can</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">only tell</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">if something is true if i know what it</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">means and therefore</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">uh to the various beads of the abacus</p>

<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">and is and then we could get it to say</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">have meaning</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">he just says that manipulation of those</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">to it if you put the abacus on the beach</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">the waves moved the abacus so the beads</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">would you think that the the the waves</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">of course not it right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">only when the symbols and we&#39;ll come</p>

<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">ai is just let&#39;s make machines that do</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">things that people used to have to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">like in the 1930s computers was the name</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">that were in your business and you set</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">and now the job that used to be done by</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">people is now done by a machine or you</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">used to have to go to a teller</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">but now that you can go to uh a an</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">automatic an atm</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">right and so and that i don&#39;t like these</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">because it sounds pejorative but weak ai</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">is let&#39;s make machines that can do what</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">is the project of trying to do the</p>

<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">use greg&#39;s term justification</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">for hobbs claim that cognition</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">by creating an instance of commute of</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">gives me a plausible response</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">so notice how the problem of strong ai</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">is actually bound up with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">world not that greg and i are attempting</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s so cool to me i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">about this history</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">um but as soon as i was hearing about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">oh my god this is the chinese room</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">problem which</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:00.640" style="s2">i hope folks who are watching this know</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">you know this is john searle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:03.760" style="s2">argument against strong ai so so cool</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.760" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">descartes and hobbes are stumbling</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">across this you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.960" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">basic uh i would not have guessed that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">to me that&#39;s just really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">here&#39;s another thing that i&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">is that um we talked briefly about this</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.079" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">and i think we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">keep coming back this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">uh like matter and energy this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">interesting and complicated concept um</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.240" style="s2">and one of the things that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">to want to differentiate is information</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.240" end="00:38:35.280" style="s2">theoretic models</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">which actually connect deeply to</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the information</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">that&#39;s right element okay so i am</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:04.079" style="s2">saying hobbs is basically hey can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">just do this by via information</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.079" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">you know computation right and and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">car&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">because you have semantic meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">you know that</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">that makes us as embodied entities that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">are actually deciphering</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">truth and meaning and reality etc well</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">very well said greg and so yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">technical sense of meaning and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">semantic sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">sorry that technical sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">information and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">semantic meaning oriented sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">um uh trying to bridge between them</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">is a difficult task and i think i</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">i might have mentioned the last time you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">know there&#39;s work by uh people very</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">recent we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">to wrestle with that and the thing we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">have to avoid and this is what i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">greg is pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.240" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">and this is why the problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">again is so central if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">keep these clearly distinct you will</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.359" end="00:39:55.119" style="s2">equivocate between them</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">and you will say well what&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">you know there&#39;s information</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">in the technical sense in my nervous</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">system and that&#39;s just becomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">information in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">and why is their mind body problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">that&#39;s because you&#39;ve equivocated</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">between these two totally different</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">senses of information</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">and therefore you haven&#39;t solved the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">problem you&#39;ve just fudged over it</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.839" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">and so this is another version of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the central problems in</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">strong ai and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:23.040" style="s2">cyril uh uh point points us to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.440" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">but as greg said i think cyril&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.040" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">argument is just a modern one of cyril&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">this is a modern version of what was</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">going on between descartes and hops</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">is that you know the the within</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">a strong ai we see a version of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">body problem as the technical</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:43.599" style="s2">semantic information problem how do we</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">bridge between them</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.599" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">in a completely non-equivocal</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">and consistent manner how do we</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">scientifically you know integrate them</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">or unify them and that is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:55.920" style="s2">very hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna see that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.920" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">proposals that uh try to bridge that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">are going to invoke notions of agency um</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">autonomy self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">uh things like that amen so what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">actually sneak aristotle back in in</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">order to try and deal with the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">that has been given to us uh by decode</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">so uh let&#39;s recap what we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">uh we&#39;ve got three arguments uh we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">the argument we&#39;ve just done which is um</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">uh cognition can&#39;t be mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">material computation</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">uh because the scientific revolution has</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">removed all the properties</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">central to scientific reasoning from</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">matter right and then you would just be</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">in a huge performative contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">according to descartes</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">if you try to uh derive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">reasoning from matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:51.359" style="s2">we just did earlier the comparative</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">realness argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.359" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">the consequence we uh the the the mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">is comparatively</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">more real to us but what descartes does</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">is slip in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">of determining what&#39;s real uh that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">contrast to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.839" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">mathematical logical way of determining</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:08.760" style="s2">what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">he now puts in this direct</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.760" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">phenomenological experiential</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">participatory sense of realness and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">those two senses of realness are now</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">gonna because he just gives us both</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">and then they&#39;re gonna smash into each</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">other for centuries</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">uh and then we&#39;re back and then the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">original argument was</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">uh different kinds of properties</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">different kinds of stuff and we saw that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:31.599" style="s2">uh also saddles us with the mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">problem so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.599" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">where we&#39;re at so far in formulating the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">problem how&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a i think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">nice summary</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">of what is emerging right here in in</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">terms of the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">western modernist uh sense-making system</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">uh that&#39;s coming off of you know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">has its history very strongly of course</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">in the catholic</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">you know christian ideology and now is</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">making these transitions</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">and this is then okay you have this</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">mind that is representing the world out</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">you know and there&#39;s a primary world and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">then you have a secondary mapping of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">and it is your position in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">to that uh that allows you to determine</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">what is true</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">um and then we hand it that m and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">of course then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">mind body problem is actually we&#39;ll wait</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">a minute we&#39;re basically there&#39;s a dual</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">ontology here that&#39;s very very that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">recognize so so let&#39;s let&#39;s so when we</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">greg and i will say mind body and mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">brain problem but let&#39;s remember</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually always a mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">problem or a mind body problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">a mind mind problem because remember i</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">can&#39;t pick up on greg&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s also a mind world problem right</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">if the only thing my mind actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">directly knows</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">is itself then shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">i be completely skeptical of any</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">about the world out there called</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">mathematical world that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">i generally refer to it when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">sparking specifically off the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">i talk about the mind matter problem is</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:07.680" style="s2">usually because then i&#39;m going to come</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:09.920" style="s2">back and bring the concept of matter</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">in relationship to mind and add life and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.920" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">and show a nested hierarchy and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">that will change but so</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">but yes it&#39;s that&#39;s another is it mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">brain is it mind body is it mind matter</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:22.240" style="s2">is it mind world is it mine</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">these are all just good examples of wow</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.240" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">this the complexity of this grammar</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">dynamic is really profound</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">yeah that was very well said great so i</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">want to now talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">about um a little bit more of because we</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">have some time and then i want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">that way i can give sort of maximal</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">opportunity for greg next time</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">uh to take the lead uh because some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">you are probably tired of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">me talking so much and i want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">what greg has to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">and he i and he has expertise on in</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">areas i do not</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">um so i want to talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:57.839" style="s2">uh uh going back again to descartes</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:59.599" style="s2">and getting clear about a couple other</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.839" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">parts of the problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.599" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">that we need to uh clarify we i believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:04.319" style="s2">we mentioned these earlier at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">sort of the nature problem and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">generation or function problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">uh so first of all we can now clarify</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">what the nature or the generation</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">the nature of the generation problem is</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">basically the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">solving these problems that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">has given us it&#39;s the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">how do we get back together uh mind and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">matter i&#39;ll use greg&#39;s terms right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">uh now because</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">most people because they regard um</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">the dualism as implausible because of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">all of these problems we&#39;re opening up</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">around it</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">they would they want to account for how</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.200" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">mind emerge out of matter um</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">so we could get into a long attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">defend that against</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">idealisms and other things but since</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">the most people are doing that&#39;s how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">going to pose the problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">but if you want to you can always think</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">about it is how do i come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">world view</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">that reconciles the inter penetration</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">and the inter-participation of mind and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">so how is it that we have something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:17.440" style="s2">in a physical body that&#39;s the nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">problem that&#39;s the generation problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.440" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">explaining to me the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">gives a way of answering of all these</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">problems that descartes has given us</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">resolving them so that there&#39;s it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">longer problematic to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">that i have consciousness and a body and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">that they are intimately</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">interpenetrating and causally connected</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">in some fashion right that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:41.520" style="s2">nature problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">yep what&#39;s the function problem well the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.520" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">function problem is also</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">uh coming out of this uh if you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">what&#39;s consciousness for because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">remember we talked about how descartes</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t know all the important properties</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">of mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">so one of them has been post-freud the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">discovery of the unconscious and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">adds a tremendous amount to that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">here&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">a lot of that computation</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">that descartes says is what mind is</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">is running unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">i&#39;m forming you know my visual system is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">forming right it&#39;s doing some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">computation so i&#39;m forming</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">a perception of greg right now and</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">something in my hearing is parsing the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">noises that come out of his mouth</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:33.760" style="s2">and and somehow that&#39;s making i not i</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.760" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">how any i&#39;m not aware of how any of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">that&#39;s happening the only place where</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:41.280" style="s2">awareness is</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">is that the end result yeah it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">so if all of the heavy lifting and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">of the computational work</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">i&#39;m using descartes language here in</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">hobbs language here is going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">unconsciously what&#39;s consciousness more</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">what&#39;s consciousness and why and and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:05.839" style="s2">is it&#39;s sense that it&#39;s somehow</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">central or important to your agency is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.839" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">that just an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:11.760" style="s2">is that just an illusion that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">function problem what does consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.760" end="00:48:18.839" style="s2">do and you know how you know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:19.760" style="s2">a lot of [ __ ] that you don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">do i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">equivocating on the word no here of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">course yeah no procedurally</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">and no existence wise but not know</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">analytically or explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">right ride a bike right i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">amazing how much</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">um and and yet we&#39;re just aware of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:38.559" style="s2">we&#39;re aware of in a particular way so</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">this all there&#39;s an enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.559" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">embodied knowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">that takes place without consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">so why do we have it</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s the function problem now what</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">i want to briefly talk about is i want</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">um uh how descartes</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">actually wrestles with these problems i</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">don&#39;t think he resolves them but</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">his wrestling is instructive because</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">i take descartes to have the this</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">insight that these two problems need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">be solved</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">uh in an interconnected manner that if</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">you try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">solve the nature problem without solving</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">the function problem you&#39;re ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">going to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">an unsatisfactory account because what</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">would it be to say</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">how something exists without saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:24.240" style="s2">explaining how it functions how</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:25.599" style="s2">it causally interacts with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.240" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">the reverse is the case</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">how could i possibly explain how</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">something spunk how something functions</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">if i didn&#39;t have some sense of what it</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">what its ontological nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">was what what its nature is uh and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">i think we should follow descartes</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">in trying to uh answer these two</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">in an integrated fashion now that is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">typically what&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">there&#39;s been a there&#39;s been a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">recent papers that are trying to do this</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">but typically</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">some of the biggest theories global</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">workspace theory is largely a theory</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.119" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">of the function of consciousness the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">integrated information theory of tononi</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">is largely a theory of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">of consciousness and there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">recent paper that&#39;s tried to put the two</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">together because people are realizing</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">hey we really should be answering these</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">two problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">in an integrated fashion so we&#39;ve have</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">along and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">greg could perhaps speak more to it than</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">i could we have a long history within</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">science and neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">of not tackling until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">not tackling these two problems in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">integrated fashion</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">together and that has i think further</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">and sorry i keep saying this that has</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">made this problem even more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of uh a deceptive kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">because it looks like we&#39;re attempting</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">to solve</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">untangle the world not but the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">which we&#39;re pursuing a functional theory</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">or a nature theory independent of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">other i think this is really to which</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">um still making the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">more deeply problematic more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting about descartes</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">he has a sense of where they come</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">and this is a little bit tricky because</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">it requires me</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">going back to the example of the dog</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">remember we talked about how descartes</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">willing to sort of uh you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">this is apocryphal maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">uh you know do a live dissection of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">dog because dogs have no</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:34.839" style="s2">consciousness so therefore they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">feeling any pain</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.839" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">etc which i find just a massively</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">improbable</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">uh claim right and morally</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">well orally um</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">so but</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">what many people don&#39;t realize and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:52.720" style="s2">here&#39;s where i&#39;m very dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">excellent work done by</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.720" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">uh bill seeger on this is that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">that animals were not were not</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.319" end="00:52:05.760" style="s2">right and this is one of and this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">another thing that i&#39;m going to want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.760" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">challenge which is this dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">between intelligence and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:12.800" style="s2">and notice how much the function</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:15.920" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.800" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">can lead you to well i can most of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.920" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">intelligence is happening unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">so therefore there&#39;s no deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">between consciousness intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">but that actually flouts against the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.200" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">practice the way we practice is we</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">generally attribute consciousness where</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">we find clear behavioral evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">so now what was going on in descartes</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">describe said well he realized there was</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">a problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:45.040" style="s2">it seemed like animals learn and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">seems like animals solve</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">problems he could see dogs doing this</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">you could teach a dog something</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">i mean human beings have been teaching</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">dogs for a long time and dogs can</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">you know a dog can come up you can even</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:56.720" style="s2">see a dog doing you know when the dogs</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">do this with their head</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.720" end="00:53:00.079" style="s2">and their and then they seem to they</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">they solve a problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.079" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s like so there&#39;s intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:05.839" style="s2">there so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t have they don&#39;t have minds or</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">what descartes would call soul</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:10.559" style="s2">so what&#39;s going on well descartes had</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.559" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">that the the brain had states</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:19.839" style="s2">there are brain states that reliably</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">co-vary</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.839" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">with the world so what do i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">reliable covariance think of the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">your thermostat reliably co-varies with</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">the temperature in your room</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">so in that sense and we&#39;re going to come</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:34.480" style="s2">this is going to be contentious</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">but in that sense the thermostat</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.480" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">represents</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">the temperature in the room because it</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">reliably co-varies with it</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">it allows the thermostat to reliably</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:45.839" style="s2">discriminate</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">between different states in the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.839" end="00:53:50.400" style="s2">and then act accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">it will turn your furnace on or off</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.400" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">so in a more complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">sophisticated fashion descartes</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">understands this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">the dog has brain states that co-vary</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">with the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">that allow it to reliably discriminate</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">between different states affairs in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.680" end="00:54:09.599" style="s2">so that it can do it can reliably</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">differentiate its behavior</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.599" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">so that it can achieve its goals we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.079" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">we&#39;ll we&#39;ll sort of not pay too much</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">attention to that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">right now because that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">teleology and uh they curl but</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">the idea is that you have something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">um brain states sorry we have brain</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">states that are something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">representations and here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">astute people and that are watching us</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">might say ah but isn&#39;t he giving in</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t he giving in to hobbes here</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:39.920" style="s2">because isn&#39;t that what hobbes said</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">right and then here&#39;s where descartes</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.920" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">makes the difference</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">descartes said ah but those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">actually representations</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">and descripts actually borne out by sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">of current philosophy of mind because</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">current philosophy of mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a one of the most central</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">accounts of mental representation</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">is the idea that representations are</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">things in the head</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">the brain whatever that reliably covari</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">with the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:08.400" style="s2">but most people say that&#39;s an inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:11.280" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.400" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">of representation because co-variation</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.280" end="00:55:15.920" style="s2">does not pick up</p>

<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">reliably co-varying with it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.720" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">is it covariating with phone</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">is important what i&#39;m now going to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:44.480" style="s2">of different aspects of the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.920" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">thing the covariation is co-varying with</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:18.559" style="s2">technical information to me</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">all of the properties that are actually</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.680" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">so any way in which i represent it</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">as a phone or as a potential weapon i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">selecting out of all of that information</p>

<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:42.880" style="s2">higgledy-piggledy like when i think of</p>

<p begin="00:56:42.880" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">it it forms an integrated hole so how</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:26.079" style="s2">consciousness does is it aspectualizes</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">the co-variation so that it becomes a</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:37.599" style="s2">in the rediscovery of the mind in the</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:41.599" style="s2">because of how cartesian his view uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">really is so</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.599" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s the idea i got this</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">co-variation</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">and it may allow intelligent behavior</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s not representation it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:55.359" style="s2">have meaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:56.280" style="s2">it can&#39;t be evaluated for truth because</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.359" end="00:57:58.400" style="s2">it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.280" end="00:57:59.440" style="s2">aspectualized first and all</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.440" end="00:58:02.720" style="s2">are aspectual and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:05.160" style="s2">consciousness does</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.720" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">consciousness is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.160" end="00:58:09.119" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.640" style="s2">this is why for descartes you had to</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.119" end="00:58:12.640" style="s2">always be able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.640" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">when you were doing an argument you</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.640" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">could you had to be able to at some you</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">had to be able to get the whole argument</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">in mind at one time you had to have like</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">a flash of insight</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">it had to go through an aspect shift</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">because only then</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">where you was is it was it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">that you could reason on</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:35.280" style="s2">only then were you capable of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">determining meaning and therefore truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">notice what descartes is doing here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.079" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not claiming and i know greg is not</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:45.119" style="s2">claiming this is not</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">any kind of solution this is not an</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.119" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">untangling but notice what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">to the epistemic function of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">that and what this what this does is it</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">gives it gives a function to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">consciousness basically aspectualizes</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:10.720" style="s2">covariation into representations</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">and readies that information for reason</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:14.319" style="s2">which is very much like in many ways the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2">global workspace</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">and other models about access</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">consciousness as</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">poising information for you for</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.559" style="s2">reasoning so descartes got that there</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s also looks like he&#39;s giving an</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.559" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how much he was quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:32.319" style="s2">explicitly aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">of how mind emerges</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.319" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">from matter if we could figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">we do</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">a spectralization in</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:45.280" style="s2">within a physical process</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">then we could also perhaps explain</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.280" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">the emergence of consciousness via that</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">spectralization</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:52.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t think this is complete i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">think it&#39;s adequate i&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.480" end="00:59:55.440" style="s2">but what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:56.559" style="s2">notice how brilliant this is because</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.440" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">he&#39;s operating</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.559" end="01:00:01.280" style="s2">he&#39;s offering an integrated response to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">both the function problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.280" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">right and the nature problem here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">of the things i do want to argue</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.200" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">i do think that we can give and greg and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.000" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">i are going to argue about physicalism</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">and i know that</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:16.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically and it&#39;s but i do</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.040" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">think we can give because that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.720" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">attempt to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">i think we can give a scientific account</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">of aspectualization in terms of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:27.280" style="s2">process called relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:28.640" style="s2">and i&#39;ve already invoked it here but if</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.280" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">we could explain it</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">um ultimately in terms of brain well</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">embodied brain coupling to the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:37.280" style="s2">functionality</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">then we would have an account of how a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.280" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">spectralization at least</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.040" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">emerges within an otherwise scientific</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:48.000" style="s2">world view and then that would also link</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">directly to the functionality</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.000" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">of consciousness now there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:53.280" style="s2">like look at my hands</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more that has to be done</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">but what i&#39;m trying to do is show you</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">the promise</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">of zeroing in on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">point where the nature problem and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">function problem seems to continue to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:06.079" style="s2">come together</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">which is in the process of aspect</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.079" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">realization and i think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">important lesson</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">to take forward from descartes and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">going to see again this</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">these connections between consciousness</p>

<p begin="01:01:19.200" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">ramifying through a lot of the accounts</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:24.720" style="s2">of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:26.240" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to take a look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">brilliant brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.240" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">so let me summarize some of this in</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">uh so where what i&#39;m hearing so this</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:37.280" style="s2">aspect realization</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:40.799" style="s2">uh is then harmonizing at you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.280" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">aspects of this co-variation somehow</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.799" end="01:01:43.920" style="s2">right and then we talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.400" end="01:01:44.640" style="s2">function like global neuronal workspace</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.920" end="01:01:48.079" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.640" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">globally make available okay some sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.079" end="01:01:50.880" style="s2">of harmonizing a whole brain way to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.880" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">system on the same frequency yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.640" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s and so and let&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.280" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">make a distinction here between</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">sort of the ontogenetic and proximal</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">definition of functional like</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:07.599" style="s2">okay how do we manage this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">and what is my consciousness doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.599" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">um versus we haven&#39;t talked about darwin</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.599" style="s2">but of course when we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">darwin coming on the scene right yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.599" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">talk about the phylogenetic</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:19.280" style="s2">functionality</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:21.119" style="s2">yeah right and then nature built this in</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.280" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">phylogenetically for certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.119" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">purposes</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.000" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">okay and i&#39;ll just put a little plug</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">here for behavioral investment</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:31.359" style="s2">theory framework for understanding what</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">the nervous system is trying to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.359" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">very consistent with</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">carl tristan&#39;s work and others okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">basically the nervous system is trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.240" end="01:02:41.119" style="s2">to direct your energy</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">work effort all right toward</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.119" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">the good and the bad you know whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">is correlated with uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.400" end="01:02:49.039" style="s2">survival and reproductive success okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:51.760" style="s2">and what it says is it sort of downloads</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.039" end="01:02:52.799" style="s2">a model of that work investment you got</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.760" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">a model of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.799" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">the animal in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">environment paths of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">work effort</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">okay and what so what the what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">trying to do then is create</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:04.799" style="s2">a model that allows you to make</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">predictions</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.799" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">so that your investments pay off all</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.839" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:14.799" style="s2">when that&#39;s going fine great when not</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:16.559" style="s2">the system needs to reboot and check</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.799" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">okay when it gets surprised in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.559" end="01:03:20.880" style="s2">particular type of way</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:23.359" style="s2">all right so one of the things then that</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.880" end="01:03:26.640" style="s2">we may start to do phylogenetically is</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.359" end="01:03:30.079" style="s2">maybe some of this aspectualization</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.640" end="01:03:32.720" style="s2">pertains to predictability expectation</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.079" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">yeah okay yeah and then when things are</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.720" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">not expected then the things light up in</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">a particular way</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">to try to get them to model uh into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.960" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">more expected route</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">and if that&#39;s the case then this aspect</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">realization tying into prediction</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.640" end="01:03:48.000" style="s2">tying into work investment of this</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:50.799" style="s2">phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.000" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">really starts to have a phylogenetic and</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.799" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">an ontogenetic functionality</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:57.440" style="s2">um in a way that you know starts to tie</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">stuff together</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">excellent well said um so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:05.160" style="s2">there are probably deep connections</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:07.680" style="s2">between the capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.160" end="01:04:09.359" style="s2">aspectualization and model formation i</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.680" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s deep connections between</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:14.160" style="s2">aspectualization and relevance</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:15.680" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s deep connections</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.680" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">between predictive modeling</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:23.280" style="s2">relevance realization and intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">and therefore though we will turn out</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.280" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">though i will argue and i think greg</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.880" end="01:04:29.599" style="s2">agrees with me and this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:30.319" style="s2">part of i think some of my work uh plugs</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.599" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.319" end="01:04:36.960" style="s2">the history of knowledge continuum is</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.520" end="01:04:40.240" style="s2">that um there is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.960" end="01:04:42.240" style="s2">a deep connection even continuity</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.240" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">uh between the processes that make you</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.240" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:46.799" style="s2">and the processes that make you</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.880" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">conscious um</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:52.960" style="s2">which has really strong implications</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">for strong ai uh actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.960" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">um so that&#39;s where we&#39;re heading that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:05:00.000" style="s2">where we&#39;re heading</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.640" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">um and so next time uh greg&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.000" end="01:05:04.559" style="s2">take us through how this very complex</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:06.960" style="s2">and tortured grammar</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.559" end="01:05:09.359" style="s2">uh ramifies through the history of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.960" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">psychology right the field then tries to</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.359" end="01:05:14.559" style="s2">say okay we&#39;ll scientize this thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">right and then ultimately what happens</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.559" end="01:05:18.880" style="s2">is you get a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:20.880" style="s2">multi pre a multi-pre paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.880" end="01:05:22.720" style="s2">emergence multi meaning many</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.880" end="01:05:25.599" style="s2">pre meaning that they&#39;re unable to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.720" end="01:05:28.640" style="s2">develop a fully functioning paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.599" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">okay so newton paradigmatically</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.640" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">organizes classical mechanics for 200</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:33.680" style="s2">years and really remains as a classical</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:36.480" style="s2">mechanic</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.680" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">paradigm okay so we&#39;re going to try the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">system is going to try to wake up and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:41.520" style="s2">say hey should we</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.799" end="01:05:42.880" style="s2">can we scientifically paradigmatically</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.520" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">organize the mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.880" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">from this logic and then what we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.799" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">is the answer is actually no</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">that&#39;s the short answer it&#39;s no it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:53.839" style="s2">that interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">no you&#39;re not able to do it i look</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.839" end="01:05:58.720" style="s2">forward to this this is going to be very</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:05:59.839" style="s2">very exciting very interesting so uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.720" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">thank you my good friend</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.839" end="01:06:03.520" style="s2">uh this was thank you that was a great</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:05.119" style="s2">uh articulation you know it really</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.520" end="01:06:07.280" style="s2">really nailed some really central points</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.119" end="01:06:09.200" style="s2">i enjoyed it thank you very much</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.280" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">and thank you for all all of you who</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.200" end="01:06:12.960" style="s2">have given us your time and attention</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:14.319" style="s2">and look forward to seeing you next time</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.960" end="01:06:16.640" style="s2">when we continue</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.319" end="01:06:17.520" style="s2">uh to try as best we can at least to</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.640" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">some degree</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.520" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">on tangling the world not</p>
