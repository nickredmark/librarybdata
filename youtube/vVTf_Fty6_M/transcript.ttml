<p begin="00:00:04.960" end="00:00:10.730" style="s2">okay so the first one I want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.090" end="00:00:12.290" style="s2">this his talk about hierarchy so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.730" end="00:00:14.510" style="s2">gonna take me a while to unpack this</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.290" end="00:00:16.580" style="s2">because I first want to summarize his</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.510" end="00:00:20.090" style="s2">own line of thinking and then talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.580" end="00:00:21.529" style="s2">what my issue is with it so the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.090" end="00:00:22.789" style="s2">chapter of his book is stand up</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.529" end="00:00:24.980" style="s2">straightening the shoulders back and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.789" end="00:00:27.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a talk about exactly their</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.980" end="00:00:29.779" style="s2">hierarchy and he starts with lobsters</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.470" end="00:00:31.310" style="s2">and talks about how you know the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.779" end="00:00:33.560" style="s2">strongest lobster gets the best catch</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.310" end="00:00:36.470" style="s2">and access to the hottest women and all</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.560" end="00:00:39.110" style="s2">of that kind of thing and that the brain</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.470" end="00:00:42.079" style="s2">pathway in chemistry responsible for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.110" end="00:00:45.649" style="s2">lobsters recognition of its position in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.079" end="00:00:47.809" style="s2">the hierarchy is the same as we have in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.649" end="00:00:51.350" style="s2">our own in our own brains in our own</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.809" end="00:00:53.629" style="s2">chemistry you think goes on to look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.350" end="00:00:55.640" style="s2">live all the complexities of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.629" end="00:00:58.179" style="s2">and you know goes from lobsters to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.640" end="00:01:01.789" style="s2">wolves and fools to chimpanzees and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.179" end="00:01:03.260" style="s2">talks about how it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.789" end="00:01:05.660" style="s2">biggest strongest wolf or the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.260" end="00:01:10.700" style="s2">strongest chimpanzee that is leader of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.660" end="00:01:13.220" style="s2">the pack because the Sociology is more</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.700" end="00:01:15.830" style="s2">complex and so you know with chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.220" end="00:01:18.050" style="s2">in particular the biggest strongest</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.830" end="00:01:20.030" style="s2">chimp if he&#39;s just the ugly vicious</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.050" end="00:01:21.440" style="s2">tyrant world two or three other chimps</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.030" end="00:01:23.930" style="s2">will get together and bring him down and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.440" end="00:01:25.310" style="s2">so you know that just being the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.930" end="00:01:26.390" style="s2">and the strongest is not enough yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.310" end="00:01:27.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to be big and strong but you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.390" end="00:01:30.470" style="s2">also have to be able to negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.800" end="00:01:33.620" style="s2">relationships within the group in order</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.470" end="00:01:35.660" style="s2">to maintain your position anything goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.620" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">on to talk about human hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.660" end="00:01:41.540" style="s2">that human hierarchies are a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:43.780" style="s2">evolution of the concept because within</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.540" end="00:01:46.610" style="s2">human society we can create new</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.780" end="00:01:48.740" style="s2">hierarchies and so you have hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.610" end="00:01:50.120" style="s2">of builders you have hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.740" end="00:01:52.160" style="s2">musicians you have hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.120" end="00:01:53.330" style="s2">accountants and so on and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.160" end="00:01:56.780" style="s2">on so you have lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.330" end="00:01:58.420" style="s2">different hierarchies and in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.780" end="00:02:01.310" style="s2">society there are sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.420" end="00:02:03.650" style="s2">very hierarchies that everybody can find</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.310" end="00:02:07.010" style="s2">a position of some significance in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.650" end="00:02:08.750" style="s2">hierarchy somewhere or other and and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.010" end="00:02:12.920" style="s2">therefore fights and meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.750" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">in their lives he then talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.920" end="00:02:18.630" style="s2">all hierarchies are susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:22.880" style="s2">or tilt towards I think is the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.630" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">that he uses corruption and tyranny and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.880" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">that you can recognize corruption and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">tyranny taking place in a hierarchy when</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">people exercise power and influence in</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">order to ascend the hierarchy rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:37.170" style="s2">then merit that a healthy hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:38.910" style="s2">people ascend the hierarchy because</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.170" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">they&#39;re good at doing that thing you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.910" end="00:02:44.970" style="s2">know so is its merit its competence is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:47.090" style="s2">the word that he uses which allows a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.970" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">healthy hierarchy to be ascended and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.090" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">with all of that I broadly agree I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">take issue with any of that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">thought I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">very well laid out schema however where</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2">I do take issue with him is where he</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:05.430" style="s2">starts to talk about how Western society</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:06.990" style="s2">is broadly healthy hierarchies because</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.430" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">they are based on competence and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.990" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">gives the example of you know how you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">don&#39;t have bands of tyrannical plumbers</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:15.240" style="s2">going up and down the street demanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:18.210" style="s2">that you use their services that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.240" end="00:03:19.860" style="s2">plumbers are selected on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.210" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">their ability to do the job when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.860" end="00:03:25.650" style="s2">want it to a sufficiently high level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">competence and again I agree with all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.650" end="00:03:30.330" style="s2">that where I think he I don&#39;t know if he</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">willfully omits it or simply doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.330" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">fully appreciate it or maybe simply</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">disagrees with with what I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:44.520" style="s2">say but the hierarchies in which all</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:46.770" style="s2">other hierarchies are embedded are those</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.520" end="00:03:48.690" style="s2">where the true power resides so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.770" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">talking about finance we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.690" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">about government and politics we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">talking about corporate influence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">all other hierarchies are embedded</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:01.800" style="s2">within that particularly the money</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:04.500" style="s2">hierarchy I mean you you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.800" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">get anything done in this world without</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.500" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">the use of money in some way or another</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:12.420" style="s2">and so you know those that control the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:14.519" style="s2">the super hierarchies if you like in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.420" end="00:04:17.130" style="s2">which all of the others are embedded are</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">at a significant advantage and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.130" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">he profound Lee underestimates the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:23.970" style="s2">degree to which our super hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">are indeed</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:29.460" style="s2">corrupt and I give us examples the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:31.790" style="s2">revolving door that exists between high</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.460" end="00:04:35.190" style="s2">levels of government and Finance I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.790" end="00:04:37.290" style="s2">one example that springs to mind is hank</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.190" end="00:04:40.290" style="s2">paulson who Yero previously senior</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.370" end="00:05:55.590" style="s2">hierarchies as I refer to them early on</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:59.100" style="s2">that the real controlling hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.590" end="00:06:00.630" style="s2">are controlled by a very few people for</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.100" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">their own ends I don&#39;t think there can</p>

<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:06.900" style="s2">the stuff that we&#39;ve seen since the</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.229" end="00:06:23.100" style="s2">to that occurring then those systemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.419" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">barriers needs to be examined very</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.100" end="00:06:31.880" style="s2">carefully and I think there&#39;s a big gap</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.700" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">some deeply flawed systems that we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:47.330" style="s2">I mean just just one for example our</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.340" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">system of money because 97% of money is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.330" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">created as debt and debt carries</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:53.510" style="s2">interest you have this constant constant</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">ever-increasing shortfall in the money</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.510" end="00:06:57.500" style="s2">supply with a greater and greater demand</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:06:59.000" style="s2">on the existing supply of money to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.500" end="00:07:01.370" style="s2">paid out in interest payments so less</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.000" end="00:07:04.150" style="s2">and less to actually go around and do</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.370" end="00:07:06.500" style="s2">commerce you know that it necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.150" end="00:07:07.730" style="s2">impoverishes increasing that increasing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.500" end="00:07:09.560" style="s2">numbers of people and this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.730" end="00:07:11.180" style="s2">see going on around us and it&#39;s all very</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.560" end="00:07:13.010" style="s2">well saying that you know lifted this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.180" end="00:07:14.390" style="s2">many people out of starvation this many</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.010" end="00:07:16.280" style="s2">children are getting this much more to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.390" end="00:07:20.060" style="s2">eat in blah blah blah but you know this</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.280" end="00:07:22.280" style="s2">is not this the idea that things are</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.060" end="00:07:25.010" style="s2">broadly getting better this is not most</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.280" end="00:07:26.900" style="s2">people&#39;s experience certainly not in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.010" end="00:07:29.930" style="s2">working and middle classes of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.900" end="00:07:32.780" style="s2">developed world one final thought is is</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.930" end="00:07:36.590" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s use of the Pareto</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.780" end="00:07:39.700" style="s2">distribution to justify is too strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.590" end="00:07:42.770" style="s2">but to explain as somewhat inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.700" end="00:07:45.980" style="s2">very large disparities of wealth in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.770" end="00:07:48.050" style="s2">society and again I don&#39;t deny the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.980" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">existence of the freeter distribution my</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.050" end="00:07:54.920" style="s2">issue with this line of thinking is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:57.140" style="s2">whatever inequality in resource</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.920" end="00:08:00.430" style="s2">distribution might naturally manifest</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.140" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">themselves we have chosen systems which</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.430" end="00:08:05.320" style="s2">exacerbate that you know we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:07.220" style="s2">a system of money we&#39;re essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.320" end="00:08:08.390" style="s2">obviously more complex in this but</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.220" end="00:08:09.710" style="s2">essentially rich people lend money</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.390" end="00:08:10.490" style="s2">supporting because rich people have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.710" end="00:08:11.900" style="s2">surplus of money</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.490" end="00:08:13.220" style="s2">so they&#39;ve ended the poor people early</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.900" end="00:08:15.920" style="s2">interest you pay it back with interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.220" end="00:08:17.750" style="s2">and so rich people accumulate more money</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.920" end="00:08:19.640" style="s2">and poor people get poorer because</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.750" end="00:08:21.500" style="s2">things having to pay money to rich</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.640" end="00:08:22.940" style="s2">people and yeah sure a few a few poor</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.500" end="00:08:24.680" style="s2">people strike it rich and become rich</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.940" end="00:08:27.920" style="s2">people but you know for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.680" end="00:08:30.230" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a game where money is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.920" end="00:08:33.979" style="s2">inevitably drawn away from most people</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.230" end="00:08:36.710" style="s2">towards a very very few people and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.979" end="00:08:40.300" style="s2">know I he talks about Maslow&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.710" end="00:08:42.039" style="s2">as being flawed because</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.300" end="00:08:43.779" style="s2">if you accept the reality of Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.039" end="00:08:45.670" style="s2">hierarchy then rich people must</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.779" end="00:08:47.019" style="s2">necessarily be more moral than poor</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.670" end="00:08:48.670" style="s2">people because they&#39;ve had more of their</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.019" end="00:08:50.950" style="s2">needs met and therefore they&#39;ve ascended</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.670" end="00:08:53.170" style="s2">higher up the hierarchy and we all know</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.950" end="00:08:54.550" style="s2">from our own daily experience that rich</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.170" end="00:08:56.680" style="s2">people are no more moral than poor</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.550" end="00:08:59.620" style="s2">people but the fact of the matter is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.680" end="00:09:01.269" style="s2">it&#39;s very much easier to think about you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.620" end="00:09:04.029" style="s2">know working on yourself as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.269" end="00:09:07.420" style="s2">individual if your base needs are met</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.029" end="00:09:08.980" style="s2">and while very very large numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.420" end="00:09:10.750" style="s2">people are basically living</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:12.040" style="s2">hand-to-mouth struggling to survive day</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.750" end="00:09:13.240" style="s2">to day they don&#39;t have time to think</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.040" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">about them so they don&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.240" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">think about society at large they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:17.950" style="s2">have time to educate themselves or</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:19.750" style="s2">broaden their minds you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.950" end="00:09:23.890" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re bidding raising</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.750" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">kids on no money so I I think he does a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.890" end="00:09:30.670" style="s2">disservice to reality if you like by by</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:33.130" style="s2">failing to acknowledge fully the extent</p>
