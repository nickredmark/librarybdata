<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:03.050" style="s2">bit variable I&#39;m working on it I hope I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.720" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">will get better with practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.050" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">secondly and this is the main part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:08.370" style="s2">this I wanted to talk a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">about Adam Smith I refer to him very</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.370" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">briefly in passing but actually is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">incredibly important figure his main</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:17.420" style="s2">work is book called The Wealth of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">Nations and this is the seminal work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.420" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">which all of modern economic theory is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">based and I thought it would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">interesting to a take a very brief look</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:29.340" style="s2">at his thinking in his ideas but more</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">importantly because this is the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.340" end="00:01:35.190" style="s2">remember to look at how some of his</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">actually very sensible very reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.190" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">ideas have been perverted and so been</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">subverted in our modern economy Adam</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">Smith was born in 1723 and his main work</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">The Wealth of Nations was written in set</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:52.710" style="s2">will published in 1776 it took them</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">about 10 years to write it in that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.710" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">starts off by saying that people act out</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:58.440" style="s2">of a combination of benevolence and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">self-interest but the self-interest is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.440" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">the reliable gauge and that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">that is what should be used as the</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">so yeah his thinking basically goes on</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.800" end="00:02:12.390" style="s2">after the people act primarily out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:14.070" style="s2">self-interest and people require goods</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">and services that others provide</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.070" end="00:02:17.940" style="s2">especially now as because people have</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:18.760" style="s2">become more specializing and production</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.760" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">and targeted laborer meant that you know</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">self-sufficient is no longer there</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.349" end="00:02:33.730" style="s2">other things that they need and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.930" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">life requires the assistance and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.730" end="00:02:38.650" style="s2">cooperation of whether it was the phrase</p>

<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:54.129" style="s2">purely out of benevolent motives and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.370" end="00:02:58.140" style="s2">we therefore exchange with each other in</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.929" end="00:12:04.069" style="s2">in way few hands and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.369" end="00:12:07.399" style="s2">re-evaluate the way that we think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.069" end="00:12:09.379" style="s2">money the fact is we&#39;re facing new</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.399" end="00:12:11.089" style="s2">conditions now conditions that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.379" end="00:12:13.730" style="s2">never seen before you know with our</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.089" end="00:12:18.019" style="s2">technological ability and our knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.730" end="00:12:21.829" style="s2">we have the capability now to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.019" end="00:12:24.170" style="s2">abundance for everybody instead of which</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.829" end="00:12:26.199" style="s2">we&#39;re creating profits for the very few</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.170" end="00:12:29.689" style="s2">in there and this quest for profit is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.199" end="00:12:33.620" style="s2">blocking us because abundance is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.689" end="00:12:35.269" style="s2">enemy of profit scarcity makes things</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.620" end="00:12:37.100" style="s2">more valuable makes them more desirable</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.269" end="00:12:40.189" style="s2">and therefore more valuable for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.100" end="00:12:41.629" style="s2">diamonds when they find a very high</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.189" end="00:12:43.939" style="s2">number of diamonds in any particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.629" end="00:12:46.100" style="s2">here there they hold some of them back</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.939" end="00:12:48.350" style="s2">in order to keep them off the market so</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.100" end="00:12:50.839" style="s2">that it maintains the high prices of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.350" end="00:12:54.290" style="s2">diamond so you know the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.839" end="00:12:57.740" style="s2">abundance is entirely antithetical to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.290" end="00:12:59.179" style="s2">profit debt interest based monetary</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.179" end="00:13:03.379" style="s2">to go into the particulars of one on it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.350" end="00:13:06.499" style="s2">is monetary system and how and show at</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.499" end="00:13:11.689" style="s2">from progressing as a society but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.350" end="00:13:13.309" style="s2">point is that given we are facing new</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.689" end="00:13:16.699" style="s2">conditions in the light of new</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.309" end="00:13:18.740" style="s2">conditions we should be seeking new</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.699" end="00:13:21.110" style="s2">systems of organization if our current</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.740" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">ones no longer service and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.110" end="00:13:26.990" style="s2">pretty clear that our current model</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.870" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">of Finance does not serve us not as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.990" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">people this idea of needing to exchange</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.860" style="s2">one thing for another in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.720" style="s2">what you want if there is an abundance</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.860" end="00:13:38.900" style="s2">of everything for everyone that need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.720" end="00:13:44.029" style="s2">exchange things is room you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.900" end="00:13:49.010" style="s2">no longer valid so what we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.029" end="00:13:52.040" style="s2">allow technology automation the ability</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.010" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">to communicate so easily and so readily</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.040" end="00:13:56.690" style="s2">with each other now we need to that let</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:13:58.220" style="s2">that come to the fore I came across the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.690" end="00:14:00.440" style="s2">idea of the technological singularity</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.220" end="00:14:03.800" style="s2">recently on a guy called XAR beers</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.440" end="00:14:05.930" style="s2">channel well worth a watch is funny he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.800" end="00:14:07.940" style="s2">talking about this the singularity worm</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.930" end="00:14:10.130" style="s2">the singularity he defines as being the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.940" end="00:14:14.180" style="s2">point at which technology is developing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.130" end="00:14:15.650" style="s2">so rapidly it isn&#39;t possible to see even</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.180" end="00:14:16.760" style="s2">a few years down the road where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.650" end="00:14:18.830" style="s2">going to take us and whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.760" end="00:14:21.770" style="s2">reaching that point now you know where</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.830" end="00:14:23.960" style="s2">we can do almost anything we have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.770" end="00:14:27.050" style="s2">capability to do almost anything I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.960" end="00:14:29.089" style="s2">in terms of solving the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.050" end="00:14:32.300" style="s2">survival and living on this planet if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.089" end="00:14:33.890" style="s2">were to unleash technology take away the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.300" end="00:14:35.240" style="s2">restraints that are currently placed on</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.890" end="00:14:37.430" style="s2">it they need to make profit from it they</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.240" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">need to shield it from others so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.430" end="00:14:40.970" style="s2">they can&#39;t profit from it you know Toto</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:44.510" style="s2">take all of that away and just unleash</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.970" end="00:14:46.040" style="s2">it I really believe I know there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.510" end="00:14:48.080" style="s2">many out there that don&#39;t agree this I</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.040" end="00:14:50.870" style="s2">really believe that what we currently</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.080" end="00:14:52.250" style="s2">think of as human nature the need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.870" end="00:14:56.089" style="s2">trade with each other in order to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.250" end="00:14:58.100" style="s2">acquire things and seeking you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.089" end="00:15:00.410" style="s2">ideally mutual self-interest but if</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.100" end="00:15:01.700" style="s2">necessary profiting from and exploiting</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.410" end="00:15:04.250" style="s2">other people in order to get what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.700" end="00:15:07.240" style="s2">want I really think it&#39;s time we start</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.250" end="00:15:11.570" style="s2">to think of those as archaic outdated</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.240" end="00:15:14.270" style="s2">irrelevant unhelpful attitudes and start</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.570" end="00:15:18.200" style="s2">to embrace the idea of there being</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.270" end="00:15:19.610" style="s2">plenty for everyone we can do it I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.200" end="00:15:20.630" style="s2">having a conversation with somebody the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">other day and they were saying what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.630" end="00:15:24.019" style="s2">need to do is want five billion people</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.550" end="00:15:26.420" style="s2">planet I think that&#39;s an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.019" end="00:15:28.940" style="s2">cynical viewing do we really come to</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.420" end="00:15:30.110" style="s2">hate our fellow human being so much that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.940" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">we&#39;re happy to see two-thirds</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.110" end="00:15:33.740" style="s2">three-quarters of the wiped out just so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:35.420" style="s2">they&#39;re the rest of us can have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.740" end="00:15:36.830" style="s2">easier life somebody else said to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.420" end="00:15:38.390" style="s2">where&#39;s the money going to come from to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.830" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">provide this abundance for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.390" end="00:15:42.290" style="s2">well again it&#39;s a simple read channeling</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.640" end="00:15:43.640" style="s2">of resources as I said in the last video</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.290" end="00:15:45.500" style="s2">we don&#39;t need the money</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.640" end="00:15:47.750" style="s2">we need the manpower the skills the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.500" end="00:15:49.130" style="s2">knowledge the resources we need a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.750" end="00:15:51.470" style="s2">different way of channeling those things</p>
