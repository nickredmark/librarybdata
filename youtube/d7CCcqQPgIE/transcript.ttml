<p begin="00:02:35.410" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">what happened three years ago basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.739" end="00:02:43.060" style="s2">there was a series of protests at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:45.250" style="s2">Evergreen State College the Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.060" end="00:02:48.870" style="s2">State College is a very small liberal</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.870" end="00:02:57.070" style="s2">after the election of Donald Trump a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.709" end="00:02:58.900" style="s2">series of protests erupted on campus</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.070" end="00:03:01.870" style="s2">that got more and more brazen that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.900" end="00:03:03.610" style="s2">culminated in well it began it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.870" end="00:03:06.670" style="s2">culminated in a week-long series of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.610" end="00:03:08.609" style="s2">protests beginning with the protests of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.670" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">Brett Weinstein who&#39;s the brother of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.609" end="00:03:14.530" style="s2">Eric Weinstein he&#39;s an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">biologist and Brett had been I guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.530" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">arguing against certain certain methods</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">that the college was implementing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:27.250" style="s2">make the college life</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:29.500" style="s2">around anti-racism and he had some</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.250" end="00:03:32.709" style="s2">qualms with the way in which they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.500" end="00:03:35.140" style="s2">going about implementing equity and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.709" end="00:03:38.290" style="s2">was you know he argued with other</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.140" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">faculty and staff about that and those</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.290" end="00:03:44.740" style="s2">emails got into the hands of the student</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:47.230" style="s2">journal the Cooper pointer and all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.740" end="00:03:49.330" style="s2">student newspaper and then got into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.230" end="00:03:51.670" style="s2">hands of the protesters now the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.330" end="00:03:54.250" style="s2">protesters weren&#39;t really intending to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.670" end="00:03:56.709" style="s2">protest brett weinstein he was just one</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.250" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">example that they wanted to make of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.709" end="00:04:03.010" style="s2">quote-unquote racist faculty and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:05.410" style="s2">unfortunately for them they accused him</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.010" end="00:04:08.470" style="s2">of many things that were demonstrably</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.410" end="00:04:10.900" style="s2">untrue about his racist his racism or</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.470" end="00:04:13.600" style="s2">whatever and then the the protesters</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.900" end="00:04:15.940" style="s2">went on to take over the administration</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.600" end="00:04:17.950" style="s2">building to kind of basically take</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.940" end="00:04:20.739" style="s2">people hostage to roam the campus with</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.950" end="00:04:22.630" style="s2">baseball bats to assault people who were</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.739" end="00:04:26.440" style="s2">writing in chalk that they wanted class</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.630" end="00:04:28.690" style="s2">and and they uploaded and live-streamed</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.440" end="00:04:31.240" style="s2">all of their protests onto the internet</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.690" end="00:04:34.210" style="s2">and it shows some of the most egregious</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.240" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">behavior that you could probably come</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.210" end="00:04:40.360" style="s2">across in the 2010s kind of the social</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">justice activism era that i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.360" end="00:04:43.930" style="s2">kind of in a new phase of though some</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:47.050" style="s2">things are happening on twitter that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.930" end="00:04:50.380" style="s2">that seemed to want to reboot that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.050" end="00:04:51.910" style="s2">but um anyway so the campus kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.380" end="00:04:54.070" style="s2">became the laughingstock of the internet</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.910" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">for a few weeks well for a few months</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.070" end="00:05:01.000" style="s2">and became kind of a harbinger for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:05:03.490" style="s2">progressivism gone toxic and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.000" end="00:05:05.020" style="s2">sparked a whole lot or it was the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.490" end="00:05:07.810" style="s2">of like the lightning rod for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.020" end="00:05:09.550" style="s2">discussions around what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.810" end="00:05:11.320" style="s2">anti-racist what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.550" end="00:05:14.710" style="s2">progressive and what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.320" end="00:05:17.229" style="s2">conservative in these issues now while</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.710" end="00:05:19.450" style="s2">the internet was roundly mocking the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.229" end="00:05:22.270" style="s2">protesters for acting the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.450" end="00:05:25.539" style="s2">did I had been a student there and I had</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.270" end="00:05:28.630" style="s2">been kind of on camera for a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.539" end="00:05:30.340" style="s2">lectures and seminars and orientations</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.630" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">and workshops that the college was</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.340" end="00:05:36.849" style="s2">putting on that basically I&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:38.200" style="s2">since the that point that the college</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.849" end="00:05:39.970" style="s2">was setting up the students</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.200" end="00:05:43.330" style="s2">to act this way the college was</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.970" end="00:05:46.150" style="s2">programming students to become radicals</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.330" end="00:05:47.890" style="s2">and to not be very nuanced with the ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.150" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">in which they wanted to effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.890" end="00:05:53.020" style="s2">progressivism and also not really giving</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:55.180" style="s2">them the tools to combat criticism when</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.020" end="00:05:57.730" style="s2">it eventually came in fact the college</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.180" end="00:06:00.280" style="s2">itself guarded and coddled the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.730" end="00:06:01.990" style="s2">protesters before during and after the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.280" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">protests and to the state of the college</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.990" end="00:06:07.720" style="s2">and still not made amends and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:10.870" style="s2">actually apologized or done any thorough</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.720" end="00:06:13.930" style="s2">review of what actually happened anyway</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.870" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">so I had been on camera for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.930" end="00:06:18.760" style="s2">those workshops and then I went through</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:22.570" style="s2">because it&#39;s a state institution I got</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.760" end="00:06:25.060" style="s2">that footage the public records requests</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.570" end="00:06:26.740" style="s2">and I began to go through the emails and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.060" end="00:06:30.220" style="s2">the videos and present it to the public</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.740" end="00:06:33.670" style="s2">to try to get a full 360 degree</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.220" end="00:06:35.530" style="s2">exploration of the causes of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.670" end="00:06:37.720" style="s2">behavior of the students and then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.530" end="00:06:39.700" style="s2">outcomes too and really try to map out</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.720" end="00:06:41.820" style="s2">as thoroughly as possible everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.700" end="00:06:44.440" style="s2">that happened and the ideas that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.820" end="00:06:47.380" style="s2">germinating and driving and propelling</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.440" end="00:06:51.400" style="s2">all of those events so it&#39;s been three</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.380" end="00:06:53.800" style="s2">years and I&#39;m about finished with a 24</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.400" end="00:06:55.690" style="s2">episode documentary that lays out</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.800" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">everything that I have except for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.690" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">emails there&#39;s just too many emails to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:02.710" style="s2">read but all the footage and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:04.420" style="s2">give a complete story to that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.710" end="00:07:05.950" style="s2">almost done with that and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.420" end="00:07:08.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of lessons to take from</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.950" end="00:07:10.690" style="s2">that but um maybe I should ask you let</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.530" end="00:07:13.450" style="s2">you ask another question because I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.690" end="00:07:15.130" style="s2">rambled for 10 minutes tonight you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.450" end="00:07:17.350" style="s2">that&#39;s really helpful framing I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.130" end="00:07:18.610" style="s2">for everybody yeah I mean I was also on</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.350" end="00:07:21.370" style="s2">campus at the time and I can really</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.610" end="00:07:23.290" style="s2">attest to the tension that there was and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.370" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">being between worlds of just like</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.290" end="00:07:29.500" style="s2">knowing that I had all these friends who</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.820" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">were just absolutely compelled by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.500" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">narrative that of the protests and were</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:38.740" style="s2">calling Brett a racist and rallying</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:40.420" style="s2">around these things and and living with</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.740" end="00:07:43.270" style="s2">anarchist I mean it was a really crazy</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.420" end="00:07:45.400" style="s2">and difficult time to be at Evergreen to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.270" end="00:07:50.590" style="s2">be at the center of all of this so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.400" end="00:07:51.970" style="s2">guess I&#39;m wondering about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.590" end="00:07:52.300" style="s2">contemporary situation that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.970" end="00:07:54.280" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.300" end="00:07:56.440" style="s2">you kind of arise a new a new wave of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.280" end="00:07:58.690" style="s2">maybe political activity is there any</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.440" end="00:08:00.879" style="s2">lessons that we can take from from what</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.690" end="00:08:05.050" style="s2">happened at Evergreen that may apply to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.879" end="00:08:08.289" style="s2">what you see happening today well I</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.050" end="00:08:10.780" style="s2">think that what you guys are doing here</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.289" end="00:08:14.139" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t recall the the words</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.780" end="00:08:17.229" style="s2">that use mimetic masochism or something</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.139" end="00:08:23.080" style="s2">like that I mediation mediation all</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.229" end="00:08:25.419" style="s2">right I wasn&#39;t that fat I spending a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.080" end="00:08:27.699" style="s2">great deal of time really investigating</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.419" end="00:08:30.009" style="s2">the Evergreen State College you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.699" end="00:08:31.960" style="s2">whole thing I needed to branch out</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.009" end="00:08:34.149" style="s2">because I kind of ended up with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.960" end="00:08:37.419" style="s2">YouTube channel and it kind of turned</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.149" end="00:08:39.490" style="s2">into a very you know humble sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.419" end="00:08:41.769" style="s2">source of income and it was a business</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.490" end="00:08:43.630" style="s2">and I was finally creating content and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.769" end="00:08:44.890" style="s2">interacting with an audience which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.630" end="00:08:47.950" style="s2">something that I really wanted to do so</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.890" end="00:08:50.649" style="s2">I needed to branch out and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.950" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">things I ended up doing was interviews</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.649" end="00:08:55.180" style="s2">because I wanted to bring to YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:57.579" style="s2">some content that I thought would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.180" end="00:09:00.100" style="s2">unique and that would be desirable kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.579" end="00:09:02.230" style="s2">of following kind of following the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.100" end="00:09:05.070" style="s2">interest in loosely following the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.230" end="00:09:07.290" style="s2">interest of Jordan Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.070" end="00:09:10.390" style="s2">because Jordan Pederson was bringing an</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.290" end="00:09:12.459" style="s2">academic content to the youtubes that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.390" end="00:09:14.110" style="s2">was already there but he he was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.459" end="00:09:16.779" style="s2">making it really popular he was turning</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.110" end="00:09:19.899" style="s2">a lot of people on to it and in various</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.779" end="00:09:22.709" style="s2">levels of awareness and and interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.899" end="00:09:26.920" style="s2">and discourse so I began to interview</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.709" end="00:09:28.930" style="s2">you know academics first but then I kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.920" end="00:09:30.550" style="s2">of realized that oh well I I&#39;m good at</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.930" end="00:09:32.770" style="s2">listening and asking the right questions</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.550" end="00:09:34.630" style="s2">and and I can get the I can get my</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.770" end="00:09:37.110" style="s2">interviewee to really open up and get</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.630" end="00:09:39.779" style="s2">into a different level of discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.110" end="00:09:42.070" style="s2">eventually I started to interview</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.779" end="00:09:44.470" style="s2">individuals around and this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.070" end="00:09:48.040" style="s2">get back to your question I began to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.470" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">interview individuals that were trans or</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.040" end="00:09:54.370" style="s2">who had transitioned their their sex or</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">their gender or who had begun that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.370" end="00:09:59.100" style="s2">process and then reverted from that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:10:04.750" style="s2">process and I began and this is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.100" end="00:10:05.590" style="s2">this is a very ideal well this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.750" end="00:10:08.440" style="s2">direct manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.590" end="00:10:10.570" style="s2">of the evergreen way of learning is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.440" end="00:10:12.790" style="s2">you choose a topic and you really get</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.570" end="00:10:14.620" style="s2">into it and you really speak with people</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.790" end="00:10:18.430" style="s2">who are different from you and and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.620" end="00:10:21.190" style="s2">really try to just provide as a broad</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.430" end="00:10:26.040" style="s2">range of data into a topic and really</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.190" end="00:10:28.060" style="s2">get deep into it and as I progressed in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.040" end="00:10:30.670" style="s2">investigating gender sexuality and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.060" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">transition I I for whatever reason I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.670" end="00:10:36.670" style="s2">started to contact people in various</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:39.130" style="s2">different relationships to that topic</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.670" end="00:10:42.100" style="s2">feminists who had been I had been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.130" end="00:10:46.510" style="s2">strongly criticizing a certain brand of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.100" end="00:10:49.090" style="s2">kind of contemporary op-eds ism I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.510" end="00:10:51.580" style="s2">pretty critical of that sort of feminism</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.090" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">but then I I&#39;m like well if I want to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.580" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">further with understanding gender I need</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:57.340" style="s2">to speak with women who have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.510" end="00:10:59.830" style="s2">thinking about gender and thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.340" end="00:11:02.440" style="s2">it in a different way than me and and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.830" end="00:11:05.080" style="s2">I began to speak with a broad range of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.440" end="00:11:07.300" style="s2">feminists and and researchers and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.080" end="00:11:10.090" style="s2">sexuality I got to speak with some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.300" end="00:11:12.550" style="s2">the top researchers in the field and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.090" end="00:11:15.640" style="s2">then a lot of young people too and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:18.660" style="s2">get back to your question what I what</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.640" end="00:11:21.700" style="s2">what kind of initiated my interest in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.660" end="00:11:24.220" style="s2">the transition gender topic was because</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.700" end="00:11:27.210" style="s2">I saw through what happened at Wilfrid</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.220" end="00:11:30.460" style="s2">Laurier University in the fall of 2017</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.210" end="00:11:32.620" style="s2">where this TA Lindsay Sheppard got you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.460" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">know kind of GU logged a bit by her</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.620" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">professors for showing a problematic</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:42.520" style="s2">Peterson clip but I saw a lot of trans</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:45.310" style="s2">activists start to grandstand and use</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.520" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">that as a way to shut down discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.310" end="00:11:50.440" style="s2">to become very authoritarian under the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">trans umbrella and I saw with at</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.440" end="00:11:56.260" style="s2">Evergreen that you have these activists</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:58.450" style="s2">who are taking the identity at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.260" end="00:12:01.510" style="s2">Evergreen State College of blackness or</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.450" end="00:12:04.090" style="s2">of being black and then elect themselves</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.090" end="00:12:08.640" style="s2">and then because they&#39;re operating on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.400" end="00:12:11.470" style="s2">group level and not an individual level</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.640" end="00:12:13.480" style="s2">excuse any sort of behavior that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.470" end="00:12:15.400" style="s2">civil or not really take any</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.480" end="00:12:17.300" style="s2">responsibility for their behavior as</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.400" end="00:12:19.570" style="s2">individuals because they&#39;re acting</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.459" end="00:12:31.910" style="s2">excuses all their means in the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:34.899" style="s2">of that ends and I wanted to rescue not</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.899" end="00:12:42.130" style="s2">discourse from the activists I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.630" end="00:12:44.660" style="s2">to basically erode the activists</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.070" end="00:14:18.920" style="s2">suffering and and a lot of like lower</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.370" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">kind of very strong currents that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.920" end="00:14:24.350" style="s2">are very difficult to deal with and so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:26.810" style="s2">was kind of trying to take a break from</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.350" end="00:14:29.240" style="s2">that while still up still trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.810" end="00:14:30.870" style="s2">wrestle with activism by going to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.240" end="00:14:33.900" style="s2">gender topic which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.870" end="00:14:40.200" style="s2">not as fraud as the racial conversation</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.200" end="00:14:46.529" style="s2">interviewing and meeting people what</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.450" end="00:14:49.800" style="s2">would you say are like the tensions in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.529" end="00:14:51.029" style="s2">in the trans community but inside of</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.029" end="00:14:56.610" style="s2">perspective rather than kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.610" end="00:15:04.370" style="s2">are but rather from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:06.570" style="s2">people in their lived experience the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.370" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">questions kind of self-defeating because</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.070" end="00:15:27.470" style="s2">and and my my stance towards that topic</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.820" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">is one of inquiry I do have some</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.470" end="00:15:35.190" style="s2">opinions about activism and I use and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:39.060" style="s2">mock the activist portion of the LGBTQ</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.490" end="00:15:48.900" style="s2">framing that but when you get out of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.290" end="00:15:51.570" style="s2">that conversation and you go into okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.900" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">what is it like to be a trans person or</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.420" end="00:16:36.630" style="s2">a very strong large wave of young people</p>

<p begin="00:17:07.059" end="00:17:09.910" style="s2">gender is I don&#39;t even think most of us</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.890" end="00:17:57.970" style="s2">there&#39;s this other contingent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.410" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2">basically controlling the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.970" end="00:18:03.790" style="s2">right now that is acting on these</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.200" end="00:18:25.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a weird phenomenon that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:27.340" style="s2">pre transhumanism it&#39;s where human</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.870" end="00:18:30.280" style="s2">beings are starting to use our</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.490" end="00:19:05.110" style="s2">opinions on but what I&#39;m trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.100" end="00:19:08.410" style="s2">give people access to thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.110" end="00:19:12.190" style="s2">in a more nuanced unless less urgent</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.410" end="00:19:16.630" style="s2">activist way of motive of engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.190" end="00:19:19.690" style="s2">a topic can you speak a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.630" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">into the connection to the spiritual</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.809" end="00:33:05.530" style="s2">and then this one is just being human</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.540" end="00:33:09.990" style="s2">for the long game yeah like it Lisa&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.580" end="00:33:18.910" style="s2">your question like where are these</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.090" end="00:33:31.390" style="s2">I was just wondering there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.309" end="00:33:33.429" style="s2">argument that some of this less evidence</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.390" end="00:33:35.500" style="s2">based kind of weaker arguments that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.429" end="00:33:37.210" style="s2">see within some of these activist</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.500" end="00:33:39.820" style="s2">spheres are coming because there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.210" end="00:33:43.559" style="s2">of leftover institutional framework from</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.820" end="00:33:47.070" style="s2">perhaps the gay rights movement where</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.559" end="00:33:51.900" style="s2">there it&#39;s have you have you heard the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.070" end="00:33:55.210" style="s2">term the iron law of institutions</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.900" end="00:33:57.700" style="s2">basically a framework that says if an</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.210" end="00:33:58.030" style="s2">institution has been around for some</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.700" end="00:33:59.710" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.030" end="00:34:02.760" style="s2">eventually the actors within the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.710" end="00:34:05.260" style="s2">institution become more focused on</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.760" end="00:34:08.230" style="s2">advancing the institution rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.260" end="00:34:11.500" style="s2">the causes that the institution it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.230" end="00:34:13.720" style="s2">originally put in place for so some one</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.500" end="00:34:16.780" style="s2">argument might be that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.720" end="00:34:18.909" style="s2">these wonderful old charities and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.780" end="00:34:19.899" style="s2">nonprofits from the AIDS crisis are</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.909" end="00:34:22.060" style="s2">still around</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.899" end="00:34:23.950" style="s2">and in order to retain donations they</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.060" end="00:34:26.440" style="s2">have to look for new things to grow and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.950" end="00:34:28.540" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like what sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.440" end="00:34:32.200" style="s2">Milwaukee problem as Scott Alexander and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.540" end="00:34:34.060" style="s2">all that sort of a self creating thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.200" end="00:34:38.230" style="s2">that and then I wonder if that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.060" end="00:34:40.420" style="s2">where some of the less good arguments</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.230" end="00:34:41.680" style="s2">might be coming from just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.420" end="00:34:44.050" style="s2">not coming from the heart it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.680" end="00:34:48.910" style="s2">from this big institutional monster yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.050" end="00:34:51.370" style="s2">I think this is really fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.910" end="00:34:53.380" style="s2">on a sociological philosophical</p>

<p begin="00:34:59.050" end="00:35:04.150" style="s2">noticed is that we have a lot of these</p>

<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">was founded on gay rights and now over</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:37.540" style="s2">since gay marriage came through</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:40.030" style="s2">you see them switch and all this money</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.540" end="00:36:43.380" style="s2">goes directly into transit the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.030" end="00:36:45.370" style="s2">transgender riots and you see them now</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.380" end="00:36:48.310" style="s2">deleting tweets where they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.370" end="00:36:51.670" style="s2">that homosexuality is a is a</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.600" end="00:37:09.970" style="s2">just unreal why somebody would think</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.180" end="00:37:13.530" style="s2">that or why these categories would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.970" end="00:37:16.450" style="s2">swapped about that why why we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.530" end="00:37:18.610" style="s2">allowed people to decouple the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.450" end="00:37:21.700" style="s2">biological sex of what it is to be a</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.150" end="00:37:47.590" style="s2">wonderful you know the processes that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.930" end="00:37:51.250" style="s2">are pre ancient and and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.590" end="00:37:54.700" style="s2">take that category and then just make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.250" end="00:37:58.210" style="s2">not mean anything by by just handing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.700" end="00:38:00.430" style="s2">over to whoever wants to identify into</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.210" end="00:38:04.300" style="s2">that you can just elect yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.430" end="00:38:06.220" style="s2">that and and there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.300" end="00:38:08.590" style="s2">different ways to react to that I react</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.220" end="00:38:10.390" style="s2">to that because I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.590" end="00:38:12.670" style="s2">slandering something that for me I</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.670" end="00:38:18.490" style="s2">is sacred it&#39;s it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.490" end="00:38:23.590" style="s2">towards respect towards because that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.070" end="00:38:26.050" style="s2">what caused me to have life and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.590" end="00:38:27.820" style="s2">what causes more life to exist so just</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.050" end="00:38:29.380" style="s2">on the very foundational I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.820" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">individual women I&#39;m just talking on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:34.290" style="s2">the concept of female is a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.710" end="00:38:39.150" style="s2">important category for me because</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.290" end="00:38:43.330" style="s2">protecting that category ensures that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.150" end="00:38:45.400" style="s2">and that which follows from I persists</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.330" end="00:38:47.830" style="s2">through time it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.400" end="00:38:48.829" style="s2">category insofar as we are biological</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.829" end="00:38:54.190" style="s2">but that is just eroded now for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.289" end="00:38:57.380" style="s2">of what and and one more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.190" end="00:39:01.339" style="s2">off-topic thought or kind of tangential</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.380" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">thought is that the activist isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.339" end="00:39:05.809" style="s2">to be right they&#39;re not there to pursue</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.989" end="00:39:14.809" style="s2">sort of activist I guess group and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.319" end="00:39:16.579" style="s2">can see rampant hypocrisy where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.809" end="00:39:17.900" style="s2">one statement and another statement that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.579" end="00:39:19.910" style="s2">are made with the same amount of</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.910" end="00:39:22.579" style="s2">and the same amount of urgency but if</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.589" end="00:39:23.180" style="s2">you put them together they don&#39;t make</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.180" end="00:39:28.249" style="s2">they don&#39;t make sense as a as a coherent</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.039" end="00:39:40.249" style="s2">truth it goes all the way back to pre</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.089" end="00:39:43.160" style="s2">Stowe at I&#39;m sorry it goes back to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.249" end="00:39:46.489" style="s2">know Plato and and Socrates and and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.160" end="00:39:49.489" style="s2">had Socrates going down one court one</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.489" end="00:39:52.069" style="s2">frame of discourse that&#39;s aiming towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.489" end="00:39:54.079" style="s2">I guess the good or the true and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.069" end="00:39:55.819" style="s2">you have the Sophists that are going</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.079" end="00:39:59.569" style="s2">down another course of discourse about</p>

<p begin="00:40:02.210" end="00:40:06.289" style="s2">those frames of discourse I think need</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.309" end="00:40:08.719" style="s2">to come into harmony because you have to</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.719" end="00:40:12.589" style="s2">thoughts you have to follow your</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.369" end="00:40:15.289" style="s2">thoughts and and maybe maybe</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.289" end="00:40:20.630" style="s2">tried to harmonize those two things in</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.349" end="00:40:22.819" style="s2">that discourse around faith and works</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.630" end="00:40:24.890" style="s2">like you need to have the right faith</p>

<p begin="00:40:31.609" end="00:40:35.299" style="s2">has to check out and and you&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.499" end="00:40:38.390" style="s2">they&#39;ll switch discourse in order to</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.390" end="00:40:43.910" style="s2">their control there&#39;s a lot of judo</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.269" end="00:40:46.430" style="s2">going on and that happens in any given</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.099" end="00:40:53.690" style="s2">I think that we need to do is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:56.749" style="s2">kind of turning the temperature down or</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.690" end="00:41:01.069" style="s2">providing a lot of cool headed behavior</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.749" end="00:41:01.710" style="s2">where that level high radioactive level</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.560" end="00:41:12.150" style="s2">talking through things rationally but</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.780" end="00:41:14.490" style="s2">when you have these institutions that</p>

<p begin="00:50:43.120" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">concepts to interact on an individual</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.770" end="00:50:50.900" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:55.340" style="s2">not as enforcement&#39;s of a stereotype but</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.900" end="00:50:59.840" style="s2">as a sort of expression of these very</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.340" end="00:51:02.030" style="s2">deep patterns of biology and psychology</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.840" end="00:51:04.280" style="s2">that are emerging through us as</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.030" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">individuals and every individual is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.280" end="00:51:09.260" style="s2">mixture of all these different concepts</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:13.220" style="s2">and and to be able to to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.260" end="00:51:15.890" style="s2">the stereotype and the archetype and not</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.220" end="00:51:18.590" style="s2">a lot not and to kind of section that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.890" end="00:51:21.080" style="s2">off to how I interact with an individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.590" end="00:51:22.660" style="s2">goes back into what I&#39;ve been wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.080" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">with with regards to the racial</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.660" end="00:51:27.530" style="s2">discourse with regards to any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:30.290" style="s2">identitarian discourse like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.530" end="00:51:32.990" style="s2">hold onto yourself as a human being and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.290" end="00:51:35.240" style="s2">as a man and as I and then as Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.990" end="00:51:37.010" style="s2">you know like how do you go through all</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.240" end="00:51:39.110" style="s2">those different and contain all those</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.010" end="00:51:42.710" style="s2">different categories and not let the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.110" end="00:51:44.750" style="s2">category corrupt the individual but not</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.710" end="00:51:46.220" style="s2">to think that the individual is so free</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.750" end="00:51:48.530" style="s2">of category that the category doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.220" end="00:51:50.300" style="s2">actually exist anymore yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.530" end="00:51:52.850" style="s2">lot of wiggle room but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.300" end="00:51:55.400" style="s2">that those categories don&#39;t have a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.850" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">strong foundation and and to deny those</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.400" end="00:52:00.230" style="s2">categories and deny the exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:02.210" style="s2">those categories is to cut ourselves off</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.230" end="00:52:04.100" style="s2">from certain knowledge that will</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.210" end="00:52:06.200" style="s2">reproduce itself in</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.100" end="00:52:07.850" style="s2">some behavior over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.200" end="00:52:09.170" style="s2">again because we can&#39;t escape that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.850" end="00:52:11.240" style="s2">not at the point where we can just</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.170" end="00:52:13.100" style="s2">unplug from the body and upload</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.240" end="00:52:15.140" style="s2">ourselves into the mind and into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.100" end="00:52:19.880" style="s2">into the network where we&#39;re not at that</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.140" end="00:52:21.620" style="s2">point yet so I try to model humility</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.880" end="00:52:23.990" style="s2">while it&#39;s still having the courage to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.620" end="00:52:25.970" style="s2">take a position you know like you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.990" end="00:52:27.950" style="s2">and then be wrong and then to allow for</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.970" end="00:52:32.200" style="s2">people to show me where I&#39;m wrong and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.950" end="00:52:32.200" style="s2">that they can have their ideas voiced</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.440" end="00:52:36.800" style="s2">yeah thank you thank you for modeling</p>
