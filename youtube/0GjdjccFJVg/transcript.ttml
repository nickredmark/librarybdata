<p begin="00:00:01.500" end="00:00:04.859" style="s2">listening as a podcast remember to</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.179" end="00:00:08.940" style="s2">subscribe and hit the bell to track</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.859" end="00:00:12.799" style="s2">upcoming releases so I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.940" end="00:00:21.630" style="s2">both joining me here for this and I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.799" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">a sense of how to proceed here and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">first thing I had asked we do is that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">take 30 seconds of silence together and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">after that silence I&#39;m going to open a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:44.610" style="s2">space as it were I have a sense perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">of what a link one of many between us is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.610" end="00:00:53.550" style="s2">and I would presence that and not put</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">that link or that frame before being</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.550" end="00:00:58.100" style="s2">here now together more as a departure</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">point and we&#39;ll see where we land and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.100" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">then we are then we are off so if that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.049" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">sounds good then perhaps we can take 30</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">seconds of silence here I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">shut my eyes please feel free to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:24.110" style="s2">whatever is most natural yeah I will do</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:24.110" style="s2">the same okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.340" end="00:01:34.659" style="s2">oh so it is a a real pleasure in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.159" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">uncertain time to be here with you both</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.659" end="00:01:42.740" style="s2">over the last four to five months I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:45.049" style="s2">had the privilege of speaking with both</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.740" end="00:01:48.709" style="s2">of you separately on a few Cape on a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.049" end="00:01:51.109" style="s2">occasions each now and both of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.709" end="00:01:55.189" style="s2">conversations have been deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.109" end="00:01:57.950" style="s2">meaningful to me and meaningful to many</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.189" end="00:02:04.729" style="s2">I know who have listened and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.950" end="00:02:10.160" style="s2">even transformative for me and and my</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.729" end="00:02:12.739" style="s2">sense is the wisdom inherent in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.160" end="00:02:15.319" style="s2">embodiment I have been present to in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.739" end="00:02:20.180" style="s2">each of you as well as in the theory</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.319" end="00:02:22.790" style="s2">that each of you have been developing on</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.180" end="00:02:26.420" style="s2">and Express is one that is in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.790" end="00:02:29.209" style="s2">important sense deeply resonant and well</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.420" end="00:02:32.060" style="s2">worth present seeing together although</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.209" end="00:02:35.350" style="s2">of course I don&#39;t just mean theory so my</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.060" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">hope is that in this conversation we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.350" end="00:02:44.209" style="s2">all of get to know each other and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:46.190" style="s2">generate insight informative of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.209" end="00:02:48.730" style="s2">understanding that is beneficial and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.190" end="00:02:52.900" style="s2">helpful really up and down the stack for</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.730" end="00:02:58.459" style="s2">for for ourselves each other others and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.900" end="00:03:01.819" style="s2">not in any way disconnected from from</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.459" end="00:03:08.419" style="s2">mind and heart and soul and what have</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.819" end="00:03:10.130" style="s2">you and the sense I have of and here</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.419" end="00:03:15.590" style="s2">I&#39;ll present something that is as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.130" end="00:03:19.209" style="s2">core to the core insight that is moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.590" end="00:03:24.859" style="s2">me and driving me to express and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.209" end="00:03:27.049" style="s2">realize things in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.859" end="00:03:28.970" style="s2">conformity with or being informed by is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.049" end="00:03:31.579" style="s2">the following and perhaps we can take</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.970" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">that as a departure point and that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.579" end="00:03:38.030" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.230" end="00:03:41.670" style="s2">dynamic of the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.030" end="00:03:45.180" style="s2">authentic expression and how it is met</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.670" end="00:03:46.980" style="s2">in relationship in its context and here</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.180" end="00:03:49.410" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use words that I know are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.980" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">resonant with each of you in perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.410" end="00:03:55.980" style="s2">slightly different ways but to that end</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:59.220" style="s2">hopefully bring our vocabulary and sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.980" end="00:04:01.800" style="s2">together in the expression of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.220" end="00:04:04.140" style="s2">authenticity when it is met in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.800" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2">environment of care and perhaps a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.140" end="00:04:07.800" style="s2">other things although I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">belabor us with too many words when</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.800" end="00:04:17.549" style="s2">authentic expression is met with care we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:20.700" style="s2">have here a core dynamic of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.549" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">dynamic of growth and when authentic</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.700" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">expression is truncated perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">traumatized we have here the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:33.630" style="s2">opposite we have here the retraction of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:36.840" style="s2">the opportunity for growth in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.630" end="00:04:40.440" style="s2">extreme and there&#39;s links here with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.840" end="00:04:45.780" style="s2">with notions of voluntary confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.440" end="00:04:48.540" style="s2">you know of a fear of uncertainty and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.780" end="00:04:51.330" style="s2">have here also notions of the value of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.540" end="00:04:52.350" style="s2">stepping into vulnerability we also</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.330" end="00:04:54.530" style="s2">presencing the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.350" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">relationship and this dynamic between</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.530" end="00:05:05.790" style="s2">individual and context and self and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:07.380" style="s2">other so i from here as a framing I see</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.790" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">this as being something important to all</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.380" end="00:05:17.220" style="s2">of us and deeply informative of the of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:18.920" style="s2">the ideas and ultimately embodied way we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.220" end="00:05:21.050" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.920" end="00:05:26.030" style="s2">realize in our lives and together and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.050" end="00:05:30.020" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in how that lands for</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.030" end="00:05:37.670" style="s2">both of you so that&#39;s that&#39;s all I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">to say powerful framing I guess I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.670" end="00:05:43.490" style="s2">say I&#39;d want to pull out two of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">central things that were sort of anchor</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.490" end="00:05:47.900" style="s2">points on what you said this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.950" style="s2">authentic dialogue authentic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.900" end="00:05:55.220" style="s2">and part of what I would like to explore</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.950" end="00:05:57.380" style="s2">is the possibility of opening both of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.220" end="00:05:59.270" style="s2">those back up putting them into question</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.380" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">and you know in a high to garyun sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.270" end="00:06:06.170" style="s2">what do we mean by authenticity I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:09.350" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean Heidegger is perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.170" end="00:06:09.800" style="s2">person who made that you know a way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.350" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.800" end="00:06:16.820" style="s2">and but I imagine it has drifted quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:18.350" style="s2">away from what it could be for us I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.820" end="00:06:19.760" style="s2">like to what I&#39;m saying is I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.350" end="00:06:22.850" style="s2">open these both up in a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.760" end="00:06:24.230" style="s2">questioning what do we mean what are we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.850" end="00:06:30.650" style="s2">trying to get at when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.230" end="00:06:33.890" style="s2">get out of anticipating dialogue or what</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.650" end="00:06:35.660" style="s2">I&#39;d like to call deal logos and how do</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.890" end="00:06:38.810" style="s2">those two opening up how do they relate</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.660" end="00:06:42.500" style="s2">to each other because I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.810" end="00:06:43.790" style="s2">right there&#39;s a there&#39;s people are at</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.500" end="00:06:48.190" style="s2">least the people I&#39;m coming into</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.790" end="00:06:52.370" style="s2">communication with people are hungry for</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.190" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">a kind of connectedness that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.370" end="00:06:58.820" style="s2">simultaneously grounds them and affords</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:07:02.110" style="s2">them also growth and transformation they</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.820" end="00:07:06.110" style="s2">have a there&#39;s a hunger for this but</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.110" end="00:07:07.790" style="s2">they feel that a lot of the ways the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.110" end="00:07:10.220" style="s2">terms and the concepts they bring to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.790" end="00:07:13.370" style="s2">bear to try and express it are not</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.220" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">translating into transformative practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.370" end="00:07:18.980" style="s2">and so there seems to me to be a gap</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:24.170" style="s2">between the conceptual framework we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.980" end="00:07:27.620" style="s2">using to try and express this and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.170" end="00:07:29.750" style="s2">ability to achieve the goals that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.620" end="00:07:31.190" style="s2">pursuing in the expression so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.750" end="00:07:31.610" style="s2">kind of what I&#39;m interested in in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.190" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.610" end="00:07:49.509" style="s2">I guess what comes up for me right away</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:52.699" style="s2">around that is this the paradoxes of of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.509" end="00:07:55.340" style="s2">where actually is the self so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.699" end="00:07:56.810" style="s2">assuming that there&#39;s if we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.340" end="00:07:58.819" style="s2">starting with this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.810" end="00:08:02.860" style="s2">authenticity that we would be tapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.819" end="00:08:06.110" style="s2">into something that was something</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.860" end="00:08:12.430" style="s2">sincerely within me that I could share</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.110" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">with you and the paradox there is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.430" end="00:08:20.180" style="s2">that I know of course I would offer you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:28.789" style="s2">everything I would gladly unzip myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.180" end="00:08:32.779" style="s2">and be there but I have this this kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.789" end="00:08:36.349" style="s2">of interesting tension of recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.779" end="00:08:39.979" style="s2">that if I did what you would see is all</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.349" end="00:08:42.409" style="s2">the ways in which the context that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.979" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">have lived with in the experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.409" end="00:08:51.019" style="s2">I have had the the you know the traumas</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:55.670" style="s2">from school and being wrong and the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.019" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">way in which you know maybe right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.670" end="00:09:06.050" style="s2">our speech patterns are getting judged</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">that those would be indications and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.050" end="00:09:13.820" style="s2">would be they would be an illustration</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:15.829" style="s2">of all the ways in which that thing that</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.730" end="00:09:37.190" style="s2">say and Here I am in my most authentic</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.449" end="00:09:40.850" style="s2">self what the heck is that and how could</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.190" end="00:09:44.810" style="s2">I possibly extract that or find this</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.850" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">this nugget or essence even</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.810" end="00:09:50.570" style="s2">because I think there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:54.010" style="s2">yearning to get out that essence that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.570" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">somehow untouched by my culture my</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.690" end="00:10:12.470" style="s2">and I think especially right now in this</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.470" end="00:10:18.200" style="s2">the structures around us that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.400" end="00:10:24.830" style="s2">question that bears a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.580" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">think that&#39;s really important how what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:46.279" style="s2">understanding is saying and of course</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:05.990" style="s2">very much the thing I want to bring into</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.300" end="00:11:08.260" style="s2">question and that assumed idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.990" end="00:11:11.180" style="s2">have this tables for the Cartesian</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:22.310" style="s2">Heidegger introduced the term</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.310" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">into question and now it has somehow</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:32.300" style="s2">around their authenticity is if that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.510" end="00:11:35.000" style="s2">shows you how pervasive almost parasitic</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.000" end="00:11:38.990" style="s2">we want to call it the question is how</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.990" end="00:11:43.880" style="s2">carefully crafted to call it into</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.270" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">question and absorb it back into itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.880" end="00:11:47.510" style="s2">and say no no this is what it means and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">this is what we&#39;ve always been talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.510" end="00:11:52.760" style="s2">about I I find that for something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:55.190" style="s2">we should also just step back and pause</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.760" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">on right away and say notice how this</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.190" end="00:11:58.460" style="s2">how the very thing was supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:01.430" style="s2">challenge</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.460" end="00:12:04.040" style="s2">all of this got reabsorbed into the very</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.040" end="00:12:09.890" style="s2">think that&#39;s that should give us some</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.310" end="00:12:11.660" style="s2">pause for how carefully we need to work</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.890" end="00:12:13.850" style="s2">together on this right now because</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.660" end="00:12:15.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot happening in our cultural</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.290" end="00:12:21.560" style="s2">that&#39;s going to keep driving us back</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.850" end="00:12:23.090" style="s2">towards that the very thing it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.560" end="00:12:24.050" style="s2">drive us towards a closure the very</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.090" end="00:12:26.060" style="s2">thing we&#39;re trying to bring into</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.050" end="00:12:27.500" style="s2">question but I hope I understood you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.060" end="00:12:28.940" style="s2">Nora because that&#39;s what that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.500" end="00:12:31.640" style="s2">connection I&#39;m getting from what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.940" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">said that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly where I want</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.640" end="00:12:39.650" style="s2">to go and I mean even language and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:43.730" style="s2">certainly communication patterns become</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.650" end="00:12:46.640" style="s2">a kind of reflection of repetition of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.730" end="00:12:49.310" style="s2">extension of these various contextual</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.640" end="00:12:51.710" style="s2">threads that say this is who I am this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.310" end="00:12:57.940" style="s2">is and when I want to say yeah but this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.710" end="00:13:00.830" style="s2">is the real me where&#39;s the real me and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.940" end="00:13:04.450" style="s2">think that that there have been moments</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.830" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">and I think those moments of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.450" end="00:13:12.350" style="s2">might be something really to look into</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:16.460" style="s2">and that those moments where I prior to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.350" end="00:13:19.250" style="s2">the past couple of weeks my most</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.460" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">frequent experience of moments of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.250" end="00:13:26.200" style="s2">confusion that maybe had something of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:26.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.720" end="00:13:34.500" style="s2">what do I even want to call it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.459" end="00:13:38.970" style="s2">something raw okay I&#39;ll just say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.500" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">something wrong so it is when I live in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.970" end="00:13:47.670" style="s2">in Sweden and I live in I do a lot of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">lot of my life in multiple cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.670" end="00:13:54.449" style="s2">so I mean Rana which is inherently a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:56.279" style="s2">multicultural place very multicultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.449" end="00:13:58.230" style="s2">place please go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.279" end="00:14:00.990" style="s2">yeah so one of the things that can</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.230" end="00:14:02.610" style="s2">happen is that you I have found that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.990" end="00:14:06.120" style="s2">could think that I have expressed</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.610" end="00:14:09.959" style="s2">something and and then realized that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.120" end="00:14:13.500" style="s2">that is not what was received and get</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.959" end="00:14:15.480" style="s2">very kind of disoriented in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.500" end="00:14:18.689" style="s2">reception in the way the reception is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.480" end="00:14:23.180" style="s2">reflected back to me and and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.689" end="00:14:29.610" style="s2">something that happens there that is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.180" end="00:14:32.279" style="s2">like a crack in the matrix of my various</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.610" end="00:14:39.300" style="s2">contextual formations and language and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.279" end="00:14:43.860" style="s2">and those cracks those cracks might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.300" end="00:14:46.500" style="s2">the closest I know to to getting at this</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.860" end="00:14:49.670" style="s2">thing and and and right now I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.500" end="00:14:52.199" style="s2">there&#39;s an awful lot of cracks of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.670" end="00:14:56.569" style="s2">looking around and thinking you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.199" end="00:15:00.389" style="s2">really who who are we what what do I say</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.569" end="00:15:03.779" style="s2">what can we possibly say in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.389" end="00:15:05.100" style="s2">being is authentic and the second I try</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.779" end="00:15:10.019" style="s2">to make it authentic</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.100" end="00:15:13.709" style="s2">it becomes hinting for sure yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.019" end="00:15:17.730" style="s2">understand but that was a good point you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.709" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">made about how you know the pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.730" end="00:15:21.139" style="s2">I was pointing to sort of historically</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:27.720" style="s2">with Heidegger is also something we find</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.139" end="00:15:29.339" style="s2">prevalent in our own attempts IIIi was</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.720" end="00:15:31.740" style="s2">what called to mind was a Leonard Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.339" end="00:15:33.660" style="s2">song and he talks about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.740" end="00:15:40.970" style="s2">crack that lets you know that lets the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.660" end="00:15:40.970" style="s2">light in yeah and so this leads me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.730" end="00:15:48.329" style="s2">that this leads me to well somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.930" end="00:15:52.290" style="s2">practiced introducing those cracks as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.329" end="00:15:53.670" style="s2">way of trying to provoke wonder and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.290" end="00:15:55.800" style="s2">like to at some point talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.670" end="00:15:57.630" style="s2">difference between wonder which calls</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.800" end="00:16:00.449" style="s2">this self and the world into question</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.630" end="00:16:04.139" style="s2">and curiosity which tries to feed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.449" end="00:16:08.370" style="s2">plug up the gaps in the self and and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.139" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">worldview and so but I&#39;m so and and had</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.370" end="00:16:13.320" style="s2">a lot to say about a biological notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:15.209" style="s2">of the self and I&#39;m thinking here of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.320" end="00:16:17.010" style="s2">figure of Socrates that I&#39;m and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.209" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">I&#39;m working to try and understand very</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.010" end="00:16:24.779" style="s2">deeply precisely because he had a form</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:28.139" style="s2">of communicative practice that centered</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.779" end="00:16:31.380" style="s2">upon introducing those cracks getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.139" end="00:16:33.510" style="s2">people to a place of aporia where it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.380" end="00:16:35.490" style="s2">possible it was not inevitable not</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.510" end="00:16:37.560" style="s2">inevitable but it was possible for them</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.490" end="00:16:39.000" style="s2">to come to a state of wonder that</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.560" end="00:16:41.940" style="s2">opening where they could call that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.000" end="00:16:46.730" style="s2">self and the world into question and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.940" end="00:16:48.839" style="s2">then they and that could induce them to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.730" end="00:16:51.089" style="s2">see the self as something that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.839" end="00:16:53.399" style="s2">aspired to as opposed to something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.089" end="00:17:00.269" style="s2">has already possessed and so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.399" end="00:17:02.040" style="s2">interested in all of that and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.269" end="00:17:04.949" style="s2">question and the work I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.040" end="00:17:07.860" style="s2">with Peter Lindbergh and guys Sen stark</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.949" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">and Chris Masters Pietro is is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.860" end="00:17:11.339" style="s2">possible for us and I&#39;m changing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:12.780" style="s2">question slightly no I don&#39;t I hope</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.339" end="00:17:17.819" style="s2">you&#39;ll be patient with me is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.780" end="00:17:23.490" style="s2">for us to learn from that such that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.819" end="00:17:24.900" style="s2">could be better able to pursue what</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.490" end="00:17:30.270" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to pursue right now which</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.900" end="00:17:34.440" style="s2">is getting some sense of how to move</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.130" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">to think about this right now I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.540" end="00:17:49.380" style="s2">to think about it in terms of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:52.290" style="s2">have managed in past to give us examples</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.380" end="00:17:54.550" style="s2">and to be exemplars of how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.290" end="00:17:57.040" style="s2">thing we&#39;re doing and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.550" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">it mean for us to learn from him well</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.040" end="00:18:01.900" style="s2">first of all can we learn from them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.830" style="s2">then what does it mean for us to learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.900" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">from them and how do we bring that about</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.830" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">[Applause]</p>

<p begin="00:18:14.140" end="00:18:19.960" style="s2">to see how we do this is a bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.460" end="00:18:22.600" style="s2">unlikely occurrence the internet hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.960" end="00:18:24.280" style="s2">had any problems since I&#39;ve moved into</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.370" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">shining coming right now for us so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.100" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">technology is the God that limps opening</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:55.780" style="s2">the door to let the internet in this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.450" end="00:18:59.020" style="s2">that&#39;s next level my friend internet in</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.780" end="00:19:01.870" style="s2">you know yeah yeah yeah the sacrifice is</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.020" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">my girlfriend&#39;s extra a couple hours of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.870" end="00:19:07.000" style="s2">sleeping here so there has been a cost</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:08.920" style="s2">to this door opening but does it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.000" end="00:19:12.550" style="s2">actually work to open the door to let</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.550" end="00:19:17.830" style="s2">understand how signals work but there</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.180" end="00:19:20.410" style="s2">seems to be a physical world where there</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.830" end="00:19:22.360" style="s2">are some interactions and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.410" end="00:19:24.820" style="s2">level of madness by which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.360" end="00:19:26.680" style="s2">approaching this environment but as far</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.820" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned it may be possible at</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.680" end="00:19:35.740" style="s2">least you know I care it&#39;s my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:40.630" style="s2">thing all day yeah it&#39;s how I so called</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.740" end="00:19:44.140" style="s2">my problems actually but please get</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.630" end="00:19:48.810" style="s2">serious here and let&#39;s get to work hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.140" end="00:19:51.220" style="s2">all right so I was I was proposing a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.810" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">model that we could consider for</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.220" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">somebody who regularly you like I said</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:20:03.220" style="s2">he he crafted the virtue of inducing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:04.630" style="s2">cracks in people the aporia which let</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.220" end="00:20:06.820" style="s2">the light shine through of a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.630" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">possibility of self and also a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.820" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">possibility of world and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:15.610" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s wonder as just</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:17.049" style="s2">and I follow fuller and other people and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.610" end="00:20:21.940" style="s2">seeing wonder is very different from</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.049" end="00:20:25.690" style="s2">mere mere curiosity and that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.940" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">induce wonder and to put the bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.690" end="00:20:29.460" style="s2">people to a place</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:32.260" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t inevitable but it was possible</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.460" end="00:20:40.090" style="s2">where they could aspire to a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.260" end="00:20:43.620" style="s2">self and a different world is is I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.090" end="00:20:46.299" style="s2">a valuable example for us to consider</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.620" end="00:20:48.549" style="s2">precisely because the the Socratic model</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.299" end="00:20:50.380" style="s2">of authenticity is an aspirational model</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.549" end="00:20:52.600" style="s2">the true self is not something you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.380" end="00:20:54.610" style="s2">possess and it&#39;s not something you</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.600" end="00:20:56.860" style="s2">possess in distinction from others or</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.610" end="00:20:59.019" style="s2">your world it&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.860" end="00:21:01.750" style="s2">aspire to continually and never in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.019" end="00:21:04.929" style="s2">kind of completion to an ongoing process</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.750" end="00:21:07.179" style="s2">of mutual transformation and although</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.929" end="00:21:09.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not claiming we can get back that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.179" end="00:21:11.799" style="s2">would be anachronistic and and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.010" end="00:21:13.779" style="s2">therefore fallacious to Socrates or the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.799" end="00:21:15.970" style="s2">Socratic world although there are some</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.779" end="00:21:17.470" style="s2">very important similarities Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.970" end="00:21:19.809" style="s2">carrying out his practice while Athens</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.470" end="00:21:21.130" style="s2">is literally under siege the whole city</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.809" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">is quarantined and there had been a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.130" end="00:21:25.149" style="s2">plague so his context is not that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:29.110" style="s2">different from ours in some important</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.149" end="00:21:32.200" style="s2">ways I&#39;m recommending that we that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.110" end="00:21:36.179" style="s2">take a look at Socratic dialogue as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.200" end="00:21:40.690" style="s2">way of perhaps speeding up the process</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.179" end="00:21:44.230" style="s2">by which we can learn about how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.690" end="00:21:47.320" style="s2">recover a relational sentence of self</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.230" end="00:21:51.190" style="s2">and an operational sense of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.320" end="00:21:51.580" style="s2">perhaps that are urgently needed right</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.190" end="00:21:53.980" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.580" end="00:21:56.919" style="s2">and then that&#39;s on and I propose that to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.980" end="00:22:01.299" style="s2">Nora and then she had something to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.919" end="00:22:03.850" style="s2">about it um yeah I really love that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.299" end="00:22:07.450" style="s2">you&#39;re taking it to this place John</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.850" end="00:22:11.980" style="s2">because this is kind of where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.450" end="00:22:15.450" style="s2">working with all my hours and moments</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:22.590" style="s2">and days and heart and soul right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.450" end="00:22:22.590" style="s2">and I have been generating these</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.019" end="00:22:30.129" style="s2">okay let&#39;s call them dialogues but</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.429" end="00:22:32.979" style="s2">there&#39;s they&#39;re sort of I called them</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.129" end="00:22:38.739" style="s2">warm data labs okay so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.979" end="00:22:42.450" style="s2">there&#39;s an exploration of a complex</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.739" end="00:22:46.899" style="s2">question with a number of people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.450" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">that exploration includes them starting</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.899" end="00:22:53.049" style="s2">in small groups around various contexts</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:54.700" style="s2">and then they move when they want to but</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.049" end="00:22:55.989" style="s2">if I don&#39;t ring a bell and make a move</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.700" end="00:22:58.509" style="s2">they go where they want when they want</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.989" end="00:23:00.129" style="s2">and things get mixed up this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.509" end="00:23:06.789" style="s2">back in the days when people could be in</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.129" end="00:23:09.309" style="s2">the same room together so what I started</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.789" end="00:23:14.830" style="s2">to witness happening with that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.309" end="00:23:17.529" style="s2">really interesting because as people to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.830" end="00:23:21.070" style="s2">explore to question whether that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.529" end="00:23:25.450" style="s2">question is something like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.070" end="00:23:29.169" style="s2">is health or what is identity or what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.450" end="00:23:32.999" style="s2">authenticity could even be one look that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.169" end="00:23:38.169" style="s2">that becomes something that is very</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.999" end="00:23:42.070" style="s2">swiftly revealed in the stories and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.169" end="00:23:44.019" style="s2">inputs between the people as being</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.070" end="00:23:46.059" style="s2">something that exists between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.019" end="00:23:49.419" style="s2">contexts and between the people so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.059" end="00:23:55.590" style="s2">started a liminal revealer and an</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.419" end="00:23:57.480" style="s2">interdependency revealer and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.590" end="00:23:59.940" style="s2">I guess where I&#39;m going with that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.480" end="00:24:02.610" style="s2">that the the more of those processes</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.940" end="00:24:04.500" style="s2">that I have done and I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.610" end="00:24:09.779" style="s2">hundreds of them around the world the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.500" end="00:24:15.659" style="s2">more I I&#39;m seeing how important it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.779" end="00:24:21.720" style="s2">that that process of opening those</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.659" end="00:24:25.940" style="s2">cracks of coming into that that wonder</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.720" end="00:24:29.880" style="s2">is actually uh it&#39;s not to be done alone</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.940" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">no we actually need each other to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.880" end="00:24:35.429" style="s2">provide multiple description and by that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:38.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t just mean lots of perspectives I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.429" end="00:24:41.250" style="s2">also mean lots of textures of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.700" end="00:24:44.299" style="s2">talking so it&#39;s not just my professional</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.250" end="00:24:47.250" style="s2">knowledge or or just my personal stories</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.299" end="00:24:50.460" style="s2">right you have to have both of those and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.250" end="00:24:52.140" style="s2">questions and jokes and things that come</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.460" end="00:25:00.029" style="s2">up between people that are unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.140" end="00:25:03.750" style="s2">and that in a strange way in the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.029" end="00:25:10.250" style="s2">most intimate kind of shiftings happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.750" end="00:25:12.630" style="s2">in this possibility of having multiple</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.250" end="00:25:16.500" style="s2">patterning &#39;he&#39;s kind of overlay like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.630" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">more a phenomenon mm-hmm so that in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.500" end="00:25:21.809" style="s2">moiré a phenomenon there becomes I guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:23.399" style="s2">one of the signatures of them soiree is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.809" end="00:25:24.990" style="s2">that you have one pattern and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.399" end="00:25:28.470" style="s2">have another pattern and when you cross</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.990" end="00:25:31.020" style="s2">them you have a third pattern and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.470" end="00:25:32.700" style="s2">third pattern can actually tell you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.020" end="00:25:36.510" style="s2">something about either of the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.700" end="00:25:39.740" style="s2">patterns but it is this pet right and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.510" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">what I&#39;m getting at is that a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.740" end="00:25:50.220" style="s2">insight can come out of that overlay and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">and so this is where where those</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.220" end="00:25:57.029" style="s2">insights are not actually accessible</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:26:00.899" style="s2">very often in life and in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.029" end="00:26:02.970" style="s2">I&#39;m with you there&#39;s an urgency so this</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.899" end="00:26:07.280" style="s2">process that I&#39;ve been playing with is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.970" end="00:26:09.420" style="s2">actually kind of an accelerated an</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.280" end="00:26:13.430" style="s2">accelerated interdependency</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.420" end="00:26:17.150" style="s2">insite maker that&#39;s great that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.430" end="00:26:20.820" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool it&#39;s really cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.150" end="00:26:24.300" style="s2">I&#39;m very excited about this so I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.820" end="00:26:27.540" style="s2">unpack this just a little that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.300" end="00:26:29.880" style="s2">practice I don&#39;t know how much you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.540" end="00:26:31.500" style="s2">of my work but I&#39;ve been engaging in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.880" end="00:26:33.240" style="s2">lot of participant observation and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.500" end="00:26:34.950" style="s2">of these emerging I call them psycho</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.240" end="00:26:39.890" style="s2">technologies or these practices of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.950" end="00:26:44.490" style="s2">trying to afford insight and flow within</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.890" end="00:26:48.680" style="s2">you know within dialog within you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.490" end="00:26:52.050" style="s2">distributed cognition and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.680" end="00:26:52.680" style="s2">you know and also people trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.050" end="00:26:54.270" style="s2">things together</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.680" end="00:26:56.040" style="s2">it&#39;s what I&#39;m saying is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.270" end="00:26:57.810" style="s2">interesting convergence or for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.040" end="00:26:58.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve been participating in circling and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.810" end="00:27:01.350" style="s2">then they&#39;re they&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.800" end="00:27:03.900" style="s2">circling to integrate with you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.350" end="00:27:05.820" style="s2">bringing in important topical questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.900" end="00:27:08.190" style="s2">so how do we go from just circling where</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.820" end="00:27:10.770" style="s2">we&#39;re maintaining the circle to making</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.190" end="00:27:12.420" style="s2">it topical in a fashion and and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.770" end="00:27:13.710" style="s2">what are the bridging processes you do</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.420" end="00:27:16.590" style="s2">because if you just sort of slam people</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.710" end="00:27:19.080" style="s2">from circling to a topic they can get</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.590" end="00:27:22.410" style="s2">sort of it can the coherence can break</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.080" end="00:27:25.880" style="s2">and so I&#39;m it&#39;s really interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.410" end="00:27:29.730" style="s2">how a lot of things seem to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.880" end="00:27:30.930" style="s2">you know towards each other so I can I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.730" end="00:27:32.910" style="s2">ask you some more</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.930" end="00:27:35.100" style="s2">I don&#39;t know this isn&#39;t the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.910" end="00:27:36.630" style="s2">adjective so but be forgiving on it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.100" end="00:27:39.180" style="s2">I ask you some more technical questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.630" end="00:27:41.070" style="s2">more specific questions about so sorry</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.180" end="00:27:42.360" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m just gonna be a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.070" end="00:27:43.410" style="s2">bit of a cognitive scientist here for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.360" end="00:27:45.900" style="s2">moment because I&#39;m really really</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.410" end="00:27:49.460" style="s2">intriguing this one thing and and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.900" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">this is something that pattern my pipe</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.460" end="00:27:53.310" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to take anything away for</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">you I&#39;ve thought about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.310" end="00:27:56.970" style="s2">because that&#39;s very similar about you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:27:59.100" style="s2">know this sort of small world network</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.970" end="00:28:01.560" style="s2">formation you get within a brain to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.100" end="00:28:03.120" style="s2">provoke insight with in effort and I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.560" end="00:28:05.670" style="s2">wondering if we could get that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.120" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">fluid small world network restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.670" end="00:28:09.930" style="s2">between people that would also bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:12.270" style="s2">about an insight and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.930" end="00:28:15.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually already cottoned onto</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.270" end="00:28:16.710" style="s2">this and made it work so that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.030" end="00:28:18.630" style="s2">really fascinating and then I&#39;m what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.710" end="00:28:20.130" style="s2">really interested in well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.630" end="00:28:21.770" style="s2">multiple things use what you said is</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.130" end="00:28:23.090" style="s2">just lighting me up right now I</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.770" end="00:28:25.490" style="s2">interested in the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.090" end="00:28:27.830" style="s2">relationship between you know the group</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.490" end="00:28:29.810" style="s2">insight if you and the individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.830" end="00:28:32.090" style="s2">insights how are they resonating with</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.810" end="00:28:33.860" style="s2">each other how is that working and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.090" end="00:28:35.300" style="s2">the thing you talked about with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.860" end="00:28:37.340" style="s2">patterns so Chris and I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.300" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">that in the article the chapter we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.340" end="00:28:41.540" style="s2">written about this sort of third factor</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:43.550" style="s2">that emerges I see it encircling all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.540" end="00:28:46.580" style="s2">time in which you get you get so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.550" end="00:28:48.290" style="s2">get people who get into this like two</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.580" end="00:28:50.420" style="s2">people than these people and then that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.290" end="00:28:52.730" style="s2">gets late and you get that emergent this</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.420" end="00:28:54.950" style="s2">what we call the third factor I can give</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.730" end="00:28:58.010" style="s2">it sort of an extensive reference</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.950" end="00:29:00.740" style="s2">without a very just clear denotation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.010" end="00:29:03.470" style="s2">I&#39;m real and what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.740" end="00:29:04.220" style="s2">people&#39;s I I want to ask you if this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.470" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">also the huh</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.220" end="00:29:09.080" style="s2">like do people sense that but do they</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:12.830" style="s2">get a sense of something telling them or</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.080" end="00:29:14.540" style="s2">calling them to move from one one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.830" end="00:29:16.640" style="s2">groups to another and do they get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.540" end="00:29:19.610" style="s2">sense of you know that something is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.640" end="00:29:22.070" style="s2">taking shape like a like that has a sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.610" end="00:29:24.890" style="s2">of a systemic life of its own above and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.070" end="00:29:26.750" style="s2">beyond not only the individuals but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.890" end="00:29:30.590" style="s2">subgroup because I&#39;m definitely finding</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.750" end="00:29:32.510" style="s2">that you know reported continuously when</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.590" end="00:29:34.580" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the participant observation of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.510" end="00:29:37.370" style="s2">these other kinds of practices is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.580" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">is that also going on in the one-day to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.370" end="00:29:44.300" style="s2">lab absolutely and and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.460" style="s2">that happens is that it it I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.300" end="00:29:49.040" style="s2">did a lot of systems teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.460" end="00:29:53.180" style="s2">complexity teaching and it was frankly</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.040" end="00:29:54.800" style="s2">irritating because you know II people</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.180" end="00:29:56.750" style="s2">would come and we&#39;d have these great</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.800" end="00:29:58.610" style="s2">workshops and people who understood it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.750" end="00:29:59.930" style="s2">before felt very clever and the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.610" end="00:30:03.140" style="s2">who didn&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.930" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">maybe had a little sense of it for a</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.140" end="00:30:07.940" style="s2">little while but then it would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">fade away with ether away from them and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.940" end="00:30:17.420" style="s2">a here&#39;s what I&#39;m finding is that there</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:21.680" style="s2">the the structure of the process has to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.420" end="00:30:24.470" style="s2">do with creating the opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.680" end="00:30:27.050" style="s2">about so that people can have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.470" end="00:30:29.330" style="s2">conversation about the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.050" end="00:30:30.890" style="s2">is health through the context of economy</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:33.260" style="s2">and then they can move over to family</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.890" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">and and in those little circles they</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.260" end="00:30:35.309" style="s2">tell all sorts of stories and all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:37.970" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.309" end="00:30:41.249" style="s2">stuff you there&#39;s absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.970" end="00:30:43.350" style="s2">conscious purpose control over what gets</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.249" end="00:30:47.580" style="s2">talked about there&#39;s no documentation</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.350" end="00:30:48.870" style="s2">very important no documentation what do</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.580" end="00:30:50.370" style="s2">you mean specifically by that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.870" end="00:30:51.450" style="s2">recorded or people aren&#39;t allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.370" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">cite stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.450" end="00:30:56.220" style="s2">what does that mean I usually don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:58.110" style="s2">either okay okay there&#39;s no post-its</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.220" end="00:31:00.289" style="s2">there&#39;s no paper tablecloths there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.110" end="00:31:05.549" style="s2">nobody writing anything down because</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.289" end="00:31:08.119" style="s2">those contextual interactions the story</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.549" end="00:31:12.899" style="s2">that you tell me about your grandmother</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.119" end="00:31:16.799" style="s2">recipe reminds me of something and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.899" end="00:31:20.840" style="s2">is a link like compost finding links</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.799" end="00:31:24.059" style="s2">finding relational process right and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.840" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">that that is and then I go to another</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.059" end="00:31:28.200" style="s2">context and someone says something and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:30.149" style="s2">it connects then to your grandmother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.200" end="00:31:34.759" style="s2">story and the memory that that brought</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.149" end="00:31:37.289" style="s2">me to and so that this understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.759" end="00:31:39.210" style="s2">if you want to call it systemics or</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.289" end="00:31:42.600" style="s2">complexity or inter dependency whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.210" end="00:31:46.169" style="s2">you want to call that it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.600" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">very intimate so is the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.169" end="00:31:50.220" style="s2">there there exemplifying it now right</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:31:52.139" style="s2">there instantiate it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.220" end="00:31:55.799" style="s2">participating in it they&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.139" end="00:31:58.220" style="s2">sort of talking about it yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.799" end="00:32:02.610" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is there&#39;s an about and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.220" end="00:32:06.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a within ah right right so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.610" end="00:32:09.960" style="s2">the conditions of the lab are structured</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.809" end="00:32:14.869" style="s2">to offer the space for people to talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.960" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">about right but in the negative space of</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.869" end="00:32:17.960" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:20.820" style="s2">there&#39;s the liminal of what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.960" end="00:32:24.269" style="s2">connecting in the within so you never</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.820" end="00:32:26.070" style="s2">have a warm data lab on relationships or</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.269" end="00:32:29.249" style="s2">communication because that would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.070" end="00:32:34.470" style="s2">ridiculous those are all things that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.249" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">forming in the within yeah right so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.470" end="00:32:40.619" style="s2">that&#39;s been really interesting and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:44.220" style="s2">after the lab there&#39;s this moment that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.619" end="00:32:48.059" style="s2">would call the mutual learning moment so</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.220" end="00:32:49.710" style="s2">then there&#39;s a sort of a moment when we</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.059" end="00:32:52.110" style="s2">have the room in plenary</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.710" end="00:32:54.630" style="s2">and say so you know what did you notice</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.110" end="00:33:00.330" style="s2">what have you observed and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.630" end="00:33:03.240" style="s2">you get that group lift but most of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.330" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have words for what</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.240" end="00:33:07.470" style="s2">they&#39;ve experienced because it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:10.470" style="s2">such a combination of intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.470" end="00:33:12.539" style="s2">physical and emotional and memory and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.470" end="00:33:15.059" style="s2">all these things have been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.539" end="00:33:17.130" style="s2">mushing and reconnecting and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.059" end="00:33:20.520" style="s2">a territory they&#39;ve never actually had</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.130" end="00:33:22.350" style="s2">to make words for before hmm but a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.520" end="00:33:25.799" style="s2">couple of people in the room will find</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.350" end="00:33:27.570" style="s2">the words and when they start to find</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.799" end="00:33:31.230" style="s2">the words the other people also find</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.570" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">words and the words are usually</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.230" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">something along the lines of I started</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:38.909" style="s2">to notice that I you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:41.100" style="s2">repeated things in multiple contacts</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.909" end="00:33:44.100" style="s2">that there was overlap that when I left</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.100" end="00:33:46.500" style="s2">one context the conversation that I had</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.100" end="00:33:49.140" style="s2">there didn&#39;t go out of my body I took it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.500" end="00:33:54.260" style="s2">with me it was season two the next</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.140" end="00:33:57.240" style="s2">conversation and so you get this lift</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.260" end="00:34:00.630" style="s2">that happens in that moment where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.240" end="00:34:04.140" style="s2">whole room realizes that they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.630" end="00:34:06.330" style="s2">very different experiences but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.140" end="00:34:09.750" style="s2">had a they&#39;ve had a mutual learning at</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.330" end="00:34:11.820" style="s2">the same time so this idea that mutual</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.750" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">learning doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re learning the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.820" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">same thing look it means we&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:22.440" style="s2">together and that that is as unique for</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:24.330" style="s2">you or me or you know anybody of any age</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.440" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">and and really I&#39;ve been working with</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.330" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">this in very vulnerable communities and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">also in Parliament&#39;s so in inner-city</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:40.349" style="s2">Pittsburgh with groups of Islamic women</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:46.669" style="s2">in Asia in really broken towns in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.349" end="00:34:50.040" style="s2">and then with the Finnish politicians or</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.669" end="00:34:53.929" style="s2">with so it&#39;s really it kind of anyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.040" end="00:35:00.630" style="s2">can do it kids can do it for sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.929" end="00:35:03.240" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty interesting so have you has</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.630" end="00:35:06.390" style="s2">it&#39;s been written down anywhere or have</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.240" end="00:35:08.040" style="s2">you liked because I&#39;d like to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.390" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">about it and we have limited time here</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.040" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">maybe you and I can I mean how does one</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:22.950" style="s2">learn to practice it because come on</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">take our now so it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.950" end="00:35:27.960" style="s2">a lot of theory there and so to bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">this kind of back to where we are with</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.960" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">this conversation I think probably one</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:40.110" style="s2">of the most important pieces is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:44.580" style="s2">piece around abductive process and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.110" end="00:35:47.880" style="s2">that that is the piece where it starts</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.580" end="00:35:52.550" style="s2">to become clear in this question of of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.880" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">authenticity that there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.550" end="00:36:00.270" style="s2">cross contextual description that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:36:02.580" style="s2">live within everyone lives within it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.270" end="00:36:05.850" style="s2">fact I would say probably every living</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.580" end="00:36:07.770" style="s2">thing lives within a cross contextual</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.850" end="00:36:11.310" style="s2">description so if you look at an</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.770" end="00:36:14.730" style="s2">earthworm that earthworm is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.310" end="00:36:17.700" style="s2">description in a way of the soil it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.730" end="00:36:20.490" style="s2">also a description of the tree or of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.700" end="00:36:23.460" style="s2">bird or of the grandpa and grandson that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.490" end="00:36:27.330" style="s2">are going to go fishing or right so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.460" end="00:36:29.580" style="s2">earthworm is is just like you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.330" end="00:36:31.860" style="s2">a description of our education system</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.580" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">we&#39;re a description of our culture we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.860" end="00:36:41.030" style="s2">and in these different contexts are</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:44.420" style="s2">difficult to grab hold of and fix</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.030" end="00:36:46.460" style="s2">in isolation are in reductionism because</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.420" end="00:36:49.250" style="s2">they&#39;re actually not where they you grab</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.460" end="00:36:50.870" style="s2">them and they&#39;re not there you want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.250" end="00:36:54.860" style="s2">fix the education system but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.870" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">actually it&#39;s actually creative in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.860" end="00:36:59.770" style="s2">abductive process of our economy and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:02.660" style="s2">culture and intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.770" end="00:37:07.220" style="s2">expectations and identity and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.660" end="00:37:09.730" style="s2">all these things good then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.220" end="00:37:10.940" style="s2">education system is a consequence right</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.730" end="00:37:17.030" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.940" end="00:37:19.730" style="s2">I see here John if if I can just to know</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.030" end="00:37:21.650" style="s2">we are track do it no no no no no no no</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.730" end="00:37:23.300" style="s2">no not at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.650" end="00:37:26.600" style="s2">just to draw some things together and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.300" end="00:37:32.930" style="s2">make sure that I&#39;m up and with this and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.600" end="00:37:35.840" style="s2">also perhaps is to add a little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.930" end="00:37:39.050" style="s2">if I can synthesize sort of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.840" end="00:37:43.880" style="s2">themes we&#39;ve we&#39;ve touched on so far and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.050" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">importantly authenticity is not the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.880" end="00:37:49.220" style="s2">expression or the capturing of something</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">that is the inherent and importantly</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.220" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">fixed to you but something that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:57.440" style="s2">realized in a some form of cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.040" end="00:38:00.380" style="s2">but ultimately interdependent dynamic on</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">an ongoing basis with each other so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.380" end="00:38:04.940" style="s2">are we are present seeing from a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:07.370" style="s2">phenomenological perspective that we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.940" end="00:38:10.720" style="s2">talking more than that a question might</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.370" end="00:38:14.420" style="s2">be what is it to show up to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">transformation to learning to the during</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.420" end="00:38:20.360" style="s2">fourth and and remembering of engaging</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:22.670" style="s2">in a remembering of what it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.360" end="00:38:27.250" style="s2">with each other and also an aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.670" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">of our becoming and deepening together</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.250" end="00:38:35.810" style="s2">too so what we can perhaps add in</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:37.910" style="s2">although not to jump the gun is what are</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.810" end="00:38:39.350" style="s2">some of these modes of orientation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.910" end="00:38:42.410" style="s2">this is something I&#39;ve thought a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.350" end="00:38:47.150" style="s2">about what are ways we show up actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.410" end="00:38:47.930" style="s2">to these moments of when the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.150" end="00:38:50.600" style="s2">upon us</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.930" end="00:38:53.090" style="s2">John you like to use this term Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.600" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">that there is a significant imminence to</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.090" end="00:38:56.609" style="s2">the now where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:59.550" style="s2">maybe particularly challenged or call up</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.609" end="00:39:01.380" style="s2">called upon to presence ourselves in an</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.550" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">appropriate or right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.380" end="00:39:07.770" style="s2">each other given the given a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:10.230" style="s2">particular energetic context thrust upon</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.770" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">us and it seems to me we if we really</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.230" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">were to not be reductive but but attempt</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:20.330" style="s2">to synthesize some core modes we might</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:26.130" style="s2">take in response to this we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.330" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">allow ourselves to be moved by this</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.130" end="00:39:31.619" style="s2">process in a way that&#39;s appropriate and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:34.170" style="s2">we can allow ourselves as well to more</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.619" end="00:39:35.930" style="s2">confront and move this process too so</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.170" end="00:39:39.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of a push and pull</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.930" end="00:39:41.880" style="s2">dynamic that can be done effectively or</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.210" end="00:39:44.460" style="s2">less effectively and a lot of that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.880" end="00:39:47.840" style="s2">think has to do with how well we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.460" end="00:39:51.750" style="s2">able to sense what is the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.840" end="00:39:53.910" style="s2">ripening vulnerability to step into with</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.750" end="00:39:59.430" style="s2">a certain kind of care and courage</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.910" end="00:40:02.310" style="s2">rather than to rather than to either</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.430" end="00:40:05.700" style="s2">bury our heads when faced with a moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.310" end="00:40:08.609" style="s2">or in fact to attempt to close that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.700" end="00:40:11.550" style="s2">opening before in fact we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.609" end="00:40:15.060" style="s2">find and be with each other in order to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.550" end="00:40:18.330" style="s2">then come to some kind of harmony or</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.060" end="00:40:20.280" style="s2">movement together so and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.330" end="00:40:22.109" style="s2">can help ground us as well back in what</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.280" end="00:40:24.270" style="s2">some of the experiences are we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.109" end="00:40:26.010" style="s2">in our lives at the moments because fear</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.270" end="00:40:30.060" style="s2">of course is very much heightened and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.010" end="00:40:32.490" style="s2">care and courage are very much called</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.060" end="00:40:34.380" style="s2">for in this time and it is my hope in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.490" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">deeper sense that the kind of theory we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.380" end="00:40:39.270" style="s2">might be discussing in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">is in actual fact a crucial piece at</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.270" end="00:40:44.310" style="s2">more than a crucial piece that all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:46.140" style="s2">this together is very much involved in</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.310" end="00:40:48.330" style="s2">the movement towards the realization of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.140" end="00:40:50.550" style="s2">we because that is also what we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.330" end="00:40:52.740" style="s2">discussing here how can we create these</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.550" end="00:40:55.260" style="s2">mutual learning environments where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.740" end="00:40:57.890" style="s2">can give and receive to our fullest as</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.260" end="00:40:59.970" style="s2">best we can informative and enabling of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.890" end="00:41:02.609" style="s2">transformation both individually and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.970" end="00:41:05.190" style="s2">collectively in touch with ecology so</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.609" end="00:41:07.080" style="s2">grounding this back in our moment today</p>

<p begin="00:42:13.890" end="00:42:17.720" style="s2">gives you insight and then there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:08.580" end="00:44:14.910" style="s2">practices have a value I would argue in</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.670" end="00:44:17.430" style="s2">helping people remember in you know in</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.910" end="00:44:20.580" style="s2">in a sense of sati right mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.430" end="00:44:22.440" style="s2">deeply remember you know and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.580" end="00:44:23.910" style="s2">use this taste metaphor like in the</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.470" end="00:44:33.690" style="s2">like to be immersed in this to flow with</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.990" end="00:44:36.830" style="s2">this and I think that gives people a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.690" end="00:44:40.290" style="s2">kind of faith encourage that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.830" end="00:44:42.900" style="s2">realizable and relevant right here right</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.290" end="00:44:44.369" style="s2">now that&#39;s so yes I&#39;m getting the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.900" end="00:44:46.260" style="s2">nerdish scientist and I&#39;m really excited</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.369" end="00:44:48.450" style="s2">and interested about what Noor is</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.260" end="00:44:50.820" style="s2">talking about you know as a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.450" end="00:44:52.680" style="s2">but I think I can make I think I just</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.820" end="00:44:54.630" style="s2">made it there&#39;s a case for this the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.680" end="00:44:56.520" style="s2">existential import of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.630" end="00:44:59.990" style="s2">discussing I think is also apparent and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.520" end="00:44:59.990" style="s2">should be should be noted</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.840" end="00:45:06.190" style="s2">that&#39;s one that&#39;s how I would response</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.770" end="00:45:13.600" style="s2">year that sort of reframing I think they</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.190" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">here I think we&#39;re there is we have we</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.600" end="00:45:17.770" style="s2">can have a kind of stereoscopic vision</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:19.570" style="s2">where the the theoretical concern and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.770" end="00:45:21.880" style="s2">the existential concern are both</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.570" end="00:45:24.820" style="s2">actually being fused into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.880" end="00:45:28.150" style="s2">depth in which that is a value to us</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.820" end="00:45:30.790" style="s2">right here right now hmm well that seems</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.150" end="00:45:33.820" style="s2">to be called for in this time and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.790" end="00:45:36.310" style="s2">wonder if the framing of the concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.820" end="00:45:39.610" style="s2">the interior and the exterior is part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.310" end="00:45:42.730" style="s2">what is may be helpful to presence here</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.610" end="00:45:44.920" style="s2">as well so core to how I&#39;ve been one way</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.730" end="00:45:47.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve been attempting to communicate the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.920" end="00:45:51.730" style="s2">project I&#39;ve been on with this for some</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.470" end="00:45:53.230" style="s2">years is to and I&#39;m not like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.730" end="00:45:55.750" style="s2">happy with this framing necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.230" end="00:45:57.490" style="s2">there&#39;s other things I would prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.750" end="00:46:00.850" style="s2">say but what I have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.490" end="00:46:02.860" style="s2">explicitly in places is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.850" end="00:46:04.270" style="s2">making sense of what to care about and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.860" end="00:46:06.670" style="s2">of course it&#39;s more like caring about</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.270" end="00:46:08.980" style="s2">making sense of what to care about but</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.670" end="00:46:10.210" style="s2">there&#39;s because there&#39;s this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.980" end="00:46:12.280" style="s2">sense in which these things are so</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.210" end="00:46:15.070" style="s2">interdependent yet there is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.280" end="00:46:19.120" style="s2">orientation towards I think ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.070" end="00:46:21.610" style="s2">grounded in something like of love and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.120" end="00:46:23.710" style="s2">for love that&#39;s I think better made</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.610" end="00:46:25.660" style="s2">better related to in a language of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.710" end="00:46:28.090" style="s2">perhaps care or towards that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.660" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">metaphorical way rather than sense but</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.090" end="00:46:32.080" style="s2">we are here in this moment together</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:34.540" style="s2">where so much is shifting and it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.080" end="00:46:38.350" style="s2">can we draw in what is most relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.540" end="00:46:39.400" style="s2">also be anchored in what is what is most</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.350" end="00:46:41.110" style="s2">worth caring about</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.400" end="00:46:44.650" style="s2">and so it&#39;s bringing these two together</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.110" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">in the process absolutely that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.650" end="00:46:49.150" style="s2">be so fundamental well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:51.310" style="s2">Socrates taught erotica</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.150" end="00:46:54.450" style="s2">Socrates knew how to care and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.310" end="00:46:57.610" style="s2">central idea in Heidegger like the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.450" end="00:46:59.980" style="s2">the the the you know the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.610" end="00:47:01.810" style="s2">caring well and you know that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.980" end="00:47:03.430" style="s2">think and I want to turn it back to Nora</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.810" end="00:47:05.940" style="s2">now that&#39;s what I think the work I do on</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.430" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">relevance realization seems to line up I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.940" end="00:47:10.990" style="s2">think I have a sense I&#39;m not clear yet</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:12.190" style="s2">but it seems at least it&#39;s convergent</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.990" end="00:47:13.340" style="s2">with what she stopped talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.190" end="00:47:16.670" style="s2">she&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.340" end="00:47:20.030" style="s2">sort of this abductive process that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.670" end="00:47:23.150" style="s2">work because that comes up a lot in in</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.030" end="00:47:25.790" style="s2">in in my work too and so I want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.150" end="00:47:29.270" style="s2">back to Nora and I want to hear more</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.790" end="00:47:31.100" style="s2">about this abductive process mmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.270" end="00:47:35.290" style="s2">the abductive process is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.100" end="00:47:41.960" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m pretty sure that</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.290" end="00:47:45.080" style="s2">that&#39;s where the change actually is and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.960" end="00:47:50.090" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is is largely</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.080" end="00:47:53.690" style="s2">missing from most of the diagrams of and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.090" end="00:47:56.030" style="s2">explanations of systems change there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.690" end="00:47:57.710" style="s2">it&#39;s actually in the abductive process</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.030" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to get the real shift</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.710" end="00:48:08.360" style="s2">and and that&#39;s really I would say in in</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:11.240" style="s2">my sort of verbage around this that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.360" end="00:48:13.790" style="s2">very trans contextual yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.240" end="00:48:18.350" style="s2">happening across them through multiple</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.790" end="00:48:21.290" style="s2">contexts and it requires that and we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.350" end="00:48:24.410" style="s2">it all the time anyway it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.290" end="00:48:27.800" style="s2">matter of allowing for a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.410" end="00:48:30.740" style="s2">abductive process so if if I&#39;m in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.800" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">abductive process where my identity is</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.740" end="00:48:37.850" style="s2">formed through and across the various</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:41.480" style="s2">institutions of our world my education</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.850" end="00:48:45.920" style="s2">my job my family my wealth my economy my</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.480" end="00:48:50.090" style="s2">health my sexuality my gender my right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.920" end="00:48:53.330" style="s2">all of these things and and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.090" end="00:48:55.190" style="s2">them are describing each other that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.330" end="00:48:57.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the piece that when it when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.190" end="00:48:59.750" style="s2">get it it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s there it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.320" end="00:49:08.690" style="s2">but it&#39;s a little tricky to do in a you</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.750" end="00:49:12.590" style="s2">know 40 minute podcast but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.690" end="00:49:17.240" style="s2">is that in there there is another kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.590" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">of integrity so when when I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.240" end="00:49:24.500" style="s2">abductive shift in groups with groups of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:26.530" style="s2">people I don&#39;t guide it know I just make</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.500" end="00:49:31.560" style="s2">a space for it and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.530" end="00:49:34.270" style="s2">critical I don&#39;t ever ever make any</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.560" end="00:49:36.220" style="s2">inclination of what I think people</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.270" end="00:49:38.470" style="s2">should learn or could come out the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.220" end="00:49:43.270" style="s2">end of this thinking because I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.470" end="00:49:45.400" style="s2">that is absolutely not my territory I</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.270" end="00:49:47.650" style="s2">can make a space for those connections</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.400" end="00:49:50.140" style="s2">to happen but they should be alive they</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:53.140" style="s2">should be as complex and as unique as</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.140" end="00:49:56.590" style="s2">every person in that room with infinite</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.140" end="00:50:02.440" style="s2">possibilities of connecting their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.590" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">and stories and inputs so it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.440" end="00:50:09.940" style="s2">alive and that living thing is totally</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:12.850" style="s2">unpredictable at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.940" end="00:50:17.290" style="s2">pretty predictable every time I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.850" end="00:50:19.150" style="s2">it there&#39;s been a shift um and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.290" end="00:50:23.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the details of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.150" end="00:50:25.900" style="s2">shift are I don&#39;t get to voice or shape</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.140" end="00:50:30.970" style="s2">or define or in any way describe that</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.900" end="00:50:34.660" style="s2">shift I can only make a space for it so</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.970" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">what people are able to do when they</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.660" end="00:50:40.450" style="s2">start to move across those contexts as</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:44.280" style="s2">they can see the way in which they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.450" end="00:50:49.740" style="s2">interdependent and that perception</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.280" end="00:50:52.810" style="s2">without any effort has the second-order</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.740" end="00:50:55.630" style="s2">response of a kind of integrity it has</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.810" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2">to do with recognizing not integrity</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.630" end="00:51:05.080" style="s2">around what&#39;s right or wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:07.000" style="s2">integrity to show up and respond in ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.080" end="00:51:09.580" style="s2">that are inclusive of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.000" end="00:51:13.720" style="s2">interdependence II as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.580" end="00:51:17.320" style="s2">looking at one one sort of solution in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.720" end="00:51:20.560" style="s2">one context at a time or or one one</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.320" end="00:51:23.230" style="s2">trauma in one context at a time you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.560" end="00:51:26.890" style="s2">so often trauma gets put into really</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.230" end="00:51:29.710" style="s2">reductionist terms and so there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.890" end="00:51:31.450" style="s2">of a therapeutic and a healing quality</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.710" end="00:51:32.890" style="s2">to this that is I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.450" end="00:51:37.120" style="s2">talking about when we say people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.890" end="00:51:40.090" style="s2">longing this connection that in in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.120" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">longing what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.090" end="00:51:46.570" style="s2">that when you start to see that this</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">thing that is a trauma that you might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.570" end="00:51:53.820" style="s2">carrying is not actually it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:56.860" style="s2">actually located in any particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.820" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2">context it&#39;s moving between all of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.860" end="00:52:03.430" style="s2">and other people are sharing other</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:07.170" style="s2">traumas that are woven between all these</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.430" end="00:52:11.770" style="s2">different contexts and suddenly that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.170" end="00:52:16.200" style="s2">trauma isn&#39;t as internal it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.770" end="00:52:19.480" style="s2">something that is a perceivably</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.200" end="00:52:22.300" style="s2">contextual and trans contextual which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.480" end="00:52:24.940" style="s2">an enormous relief and when I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.300" end="00:52:27.430" style="s2">warm data it&#39;s it&#39;s like literally warm</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.940" end="00:52:34.510" style="s2">you can literally feel the warmth of</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.430" end="00:52:37.450" style="s2">that so it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.510" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">that and especially in this moment which</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.450" end="00:52:54.070" style="s2">i think is a moment of a need for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:59.650" style="s2">completely it&#39;s a need to integrate in</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.070" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">another way so how do we begin to create</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.650" end="00:53:09.000" style="s2">the conditions for people to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:13.900" style="s2">together into a way of seeing and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.000" end="00:53:15.790" style="s2">responding to this time I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.900" end="00:53:19.180" style="s2">an excellent question and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.790" end="00:53:20.860" style="s2">particularly interested in one aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.180" end="00:53:22.810" style="s2">that question that I alluded to or I</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.860" end="00:53:24.340" style="s2">mentioned earlier which is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.810" end="00:53:27.010" style="s2">interested in what are the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.340" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">that afford insight for people and how</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.010" end="00:53:29.890" style="s2">those interact with what are those what</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:33.400" style="s2">are the conditions that afford insight</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.890" end="00:53:36.250" style="s2">between people and how and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.400" end="00:53:37.870" style="s2">kind of a third thing what is the what</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.250" end="00:53:41.800" style="s2">is for the optimal relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.870" end="00:53:45.190" style="s2">the the the individual insight and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.800" end="00:53:47.650" style="s2">collective insight and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.190" end="00:53:50.450" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get a deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.650" end="00:53:53.900" style="s2">of IIIi think</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.450" end="00:53:57.190" style="s2">the fact that people are enacting and</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.900" end="00:53:59.869" style="s2">literally moving and they&#39;re embodying</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.190" end="00:54:01.670" style="s2">the interdependence I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.869" end="00:54:05.930" style="s2">probably playing a very significant role</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.670" end="00:54:07.490" style="s2">in in the practice because you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.930" end="00:54:09.740" style="s2">you&#39;re triggering the cerebellum you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.490" end="00:54:11.510" style="s2">getting people to literally reorient</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.740" end="00:54:12.980" style="s2">their visual processing what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.510" end="00:54:15.559" style="s2">foregrounding and back rounding is</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.980" end="00:54:17.180" style="s2">literally shifting we know that those</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.559" end="00:54:19.160" style="s2">kinds of processes trigger individual</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.180" end="00:54:21.799" style="s2">insight and then if they&#39;re and if that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.160" end="00:54:23.720" style="s2">if that&#39;s an insight that also you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.799" end="00:54:26.119" style="s2">gets them to realize the interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.720" end="00:54:28.670" style="s2">then I can see how the groups would also</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.119" end="00:54:35.329" style="s2">restructure collectively so that various</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.670" end="00:54:38.180" style="s2">things are again being facilitated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.329" end="00:54:39.619" style="s2">interesting about this maybe I can form</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.180" end="00:54:42.369" style="s2">a question around that bridge that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.619" end="00:54:45.410" style="s2">just made because when you look within</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.369" end="00:54:47.329" style="s2">individual cognition inducing</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.410" end="00:54:50.119" style="s2">criticality you have to introduce some</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.329" end="00:54:51.559" style="s2">significant amount of disruption like if</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.119" end="00:54:53.059" style="s2">if you hear somebody&#39;s trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.559" end="00:54:55.490" style="s2">an insight problem on a computer screen</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.059" end="00:54:57.890" style="s2">you put some static or some noise and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.490" end="00:55:00.470" style="s2">put a bit of entropy in it or you allow</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.890" end="00:55:02.089" style="s2">or or you moderately distract them not</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.470" end="00:55:04.819" style="s2">to distracted so they leave the problem</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.089" end="00:55:07.700" style="s2">but enough that they&#39;ll sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.819" end="00:55:10.009" style="s2">they get you break up the stability and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.700" end="00:55:11.809" style="s2">that criticality actually affords the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.009" end="00:55:13.579" style="s2">restructuring like the way a sand pile</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.809" end="00:55:15.140" style="s2">will self organize and then it</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.579" end="00:55:19.519" style="s2">avalanches and that affords a new</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.140" end="00:55:21.980" style="s2">structure so I&#39;m wondering if if if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.519" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">if you see that playing a role within</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.980" end="00:55:26.900" style="s2">the one data that there&#39;s there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:29.240" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.900" end="00:55:32.569" style="s2">there a presence of disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.240" end="00:55:34.730" style="s2">strategies sort of being played with you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.569" end="00:55:36.740" style="s2">know in contrast but interdependently</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.730" end="00:55:38.329" style="s2">with constructive strategies you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.740" end="00:55:39.890" style="s2">seeing that the criticality and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.329" end="00:55:41.859" style="s2">construction are sort of usually</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.890" end="00:55:45.410" style="s2">interpenetrating is that happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.859" end="00:55:47.630" style="s2">absolutely because when people go into</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.410" end="00:55:49.849" style="s2">so if you get up from one context and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.630" end="00:55:52.579" style="s2">you walk over to another one noise</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.849" end="00:55:56.329" style="s2">induction yeah yeah right you you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.579" end="00:55:58.640" style="s2">to actually you know come into that so</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.329" end="00:56:01.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of what&#39;s happening who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.640" end="00:56:04.100" style="s2">here there&#39;s a whole process of paying</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.970" end="00:56:08.090" style="s2">attention in ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.100" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">are all sorts of nonverbal attention and</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.090" end="00:56:15.170" style="s2">then in engaging in that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2">and bringing with you this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.170" end="00:56:19.910" style="s2">that just came onboard and maybe the one</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:23.210" style="s2">before that because it&#39;s usually the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.910" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">third context that you start to get the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.210" end="00:56:32.030" style="s2">the pop yeah that makes sense to me and</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:35.030" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s also being in a room where</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.030" end="00:56:36.800" style="s2">there are all those contexts so you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.030" end="00:56:40.340" style="s2">you&#39;re in a room where there is this</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.800" end="00:56:41.600" style="s2">meta right and that people can hear it</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.340" end="00:56:44.990" style="s2">in the background to some degree right</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.600" end="00:56:47.120" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah and so that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.990" end="00:56:49.630" style="s2">get to forget that you&#39;re in this meta</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.120" end="00:56:54.830" style="s2">which is really interesting it it</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.630" end="00:56:59.330" style="s2">actually it really decreases the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.830" end="00:57:01.490" style="s2">possibility for polarization which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.330" end="00:57:03.590" style="s2">really really interesting especially in</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.490" end="00:57:07.370" style="s2">you know in these times where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.590" end="00:57:09.770" style="s2">been so much polarization that you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.370" end="00:57:11.780" style="s2">usually we go traveling down a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.770" end="00:57:15.260" style="s2">hole because we feel like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.780" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">context someone&#39;s not seeing and but if</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.260" end="00:57:18.950" style="s2">it&#39;s in the room and it&#39;s just over</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:22.670" style="s2">there you can just go over there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.950" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">not people are less prone to positioning</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.670" end="00:57:30.110" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s that and that is I guess</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:32.630" style="s2">you could call that a disruptor but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.110" end="00:57:34.430" style="s2">a gentle one yeah I think I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.630" end="00:57:35.660" style="s2">want wild it&#39;s also you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.430" end="00:57:38.150" style="s2">want to you don&#39;t want to break the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.660" end="00:57:39.740" style="s2">system right now you&#39;ve got to perturb</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.150" end="00:57:41.840" style="s2">it because if you don&#39;t perturb it</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.740" end="00:57:44.060" style="s2">enough it you know it&#39;ll get into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.840" end="00:57:47.660" style="s2">local minima it&#39;ll stabilize prematurely</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.060" end="00:57:49.970" style="s2">and then people can often not you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.660" end="00:57:55.280" style="s2">explore this the space of possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.970" end="00:57:58.430" style="s2">as deeply as as is probably needed and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.280" end="00:58:01.550" style="s2">the other thing is that I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.430" end="00:58:03.830" style="s2">talked about topics yeah and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.550" end="00:58:06.140" style="s2">things that is really important is to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.830" end="00:58:08.870" style="s2">not have topics where people have</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.140" end="00:58:11.240" style="s2">scripts so that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.870" end="00:58:12.500" style="s2">question how do you do that because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.240" end="00:58:15.470" style="s2">know a lot of the a lot of the things</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.500" end="00:58:17.570" style="s2">you brought up as examples struck me as</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.470" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">one which people often have</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.570" end="00:58:24.080" style="s2">you know pretty firm opinions that have</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:26.120" style="s2">a lot of cultural baggage of touch them</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.080" end="00:58:27.860" style="s2">like health for example like you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.120" end="00:58:29.840" style="s2">people have lots of opinions about</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.860" end="00:58:32.090" style="s2">health of course now even more so and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.840" end="00:58:34.430" style="s2">there&#39;s all this cultural valuation of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.090" end="00:58:37.130" style="s2">health han says you know that health has</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.430" end="00:58:38.480" style="s2">become our God in some ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.130" end="00:58:41.780" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s the thing that justifies</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:43.670" style="s2">everything else we do so what does that</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.780" end="00:58:45.890" style="s2">mean that that&#39;s very provocative what</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.670" end="00:58:47.630" style="s2">you just said how would you bring up</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.890" end="00:58:49.520" style="s2">like that existed let&#39;s do that one</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.630" end="00:58:51.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually relevant to how</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.520" end="00:58:54.830" style="s2">would you bring up health and keep it</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.260" end="00:58:58.970" style="s2">off script how does that work well you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.830" end="00:59:02.090" style="s2">might bring up family hmm okay if I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.970" end="00:59:06.950" style="s2">working with a bunch of doctors but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.090" end="00:59:11.360" style="s2">might bring use family health be one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.950" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">the contexts I see I see I see so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.360" end="00:59:18.920" style="s2">you get this right you get it off center</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:21.650" style="s2">so that you can actually reorient and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.920" end="00:59:24.080" style="s2">read that the abductive processes move</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.650" end="00:59:26.570" style="s2">in other ways oh that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.080" end="00:59:28.310" style="s2">that&#39;s very good yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.570" end="00:59:30.500" style="s2">decentering strategies also are things</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.310" end="00:59:33.050" style="s2">found within individual cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.500" end="00:59:34.610" style="s2">insight so it&#39;s interesting of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.050" end="00:59:38.030" style="s2">murren that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.610" end="00:59:40.610" style="s2">I had one recently and and this I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.030" end="00:59:42.770" style="s2">Tim this really is important with your</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.610" end="00:59:45.980" style="s2">question around authenticity because</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.770" end="00:59:49.130" style="s2">this is this is kind of critical is how</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.980" end="00:59:56.120" style="s2">to get off of these scripts and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.130" end="00:59:59.750" style="s2">scripts have meaning and have have have</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.120" end="01:00:04.280" style="s2">have a set of signaling and receiving</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.750" end="01:00:07.070" style="s2">possibilities within relationships if</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.280" end="01:00:09.050" style="s2">you if you are in a set of different</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.070" end="01:00:12.550" style="s2">relationships those signaling</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.050" end="01:00:18.950" style="s2">don&#39;t go anywhere you can still signal</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.550" end="01:00:22.610" style="s2">they just kind of dud so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.950" end="01:00:24.710" style="s2">something to get off context too if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.610" end="01:00:30.050" style="s2">have a bunch of you know doctors talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.710" end="01:00:32.870" style="s2">about media for example</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.050" end="01:00:34.970" style="s2">and family and suddenly that there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.870" end="01:00:39.590" style="s2">kinds of health stuff that is implicit</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.970" end="01:00:41.480" style="s2">in there and it connects in but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.590" end="01:00:44.600" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying so it&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.480" end="01:00:47.260" style="s2">of not going for the direct corrective</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.600" end="01:00:55.940" style="s2">which is going to generate all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.260" end="01:00:57.860" style="s2">reductionist scripted maybe I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.940" end="01:01:00.380" style="s2">how that connects to authenticity but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.860" end="01:01:02.180" style="s2">know that when people don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.380" end="01:01:05.230" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna say and they haven&#39;t said</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.180" end="01:01:08.750" style="s2">that thing before and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.230" end="01:01:10.580" style="s2">considering the the thing that was going</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.750" end="01:01:14.390" style="s2">to come from the person that just said a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.580" end="01:01:16.940" style="s2">thing that that they they enter into a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.390" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">discourse in another way they enter into</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.940" end="01:01:23.360" style="s2">a mutual learning in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.760" end="01:01:24.740" style="s2">surprises even them but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.360" end="01:01:27.500" style="s2">excellent connection to authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.740" end="01:01:30.230" style="s2">Nora I mean there&#39;s a deep connection</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.500" end="01:01:32.630" style="s2">between getting off script and what</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.230" end="01:01:34.880" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do here I mean right it</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.630" end="01:01:36.770" style="s2">is in this discussion about authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.880" end="01:01:37.970" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to get I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.770" end="01:01:39.830" style="s2">kind of a metal level we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.970" end="01:01:41.840" style="s2">get off script about authenticity and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.830" end="01:01:44.060" style="s2">it&#39;s now it&#39;s now that well part of what</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.840" end="01:01:46.670" style="s2">this attempt to reformulate authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.060" end="01:01:49.250" style="s2">is is centering on is the very capacity</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.670" end="01:01:50.570" style="s2">and ability to get off script but do it</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.250" end="01:01:52.760" style="s2">like you said you have to do it in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.570" end="01:01:54.710" style="s2">to do it you know you have to do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.760" end="01:01:56.060" style="s2">certain way you have to pick you have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.710" end="01:01:57.350" style="s2">get it like if it&#39;s health and you go</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.060" end="01:01:58.790" style="s2">off center because you actually talked</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.350" end="01:02:00.680" style="s2">about family you wouldn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.790" end="01:02:03.530" style="s2">like elephants for example right you</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.680" end="01:02:06.500" style="s2">it&#39;s about it&#39;s you&#39;ve got it like so</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.530" end="01:02:08.810" style="s2">there&#39;s finesse in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.500" end="01:02:10.580" style="s2">there&#39;s finesse in this if you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.810" end="01:02:13.250" style="s2">a Tai Chi player and there&#39;s this sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.580" end="01:02:15.830" style="s2">about you know a can you can you pick up</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.250" end="01:02:18.440" style="s2">on the grain of things and follow the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.830" end="01:02:20.690" style="s2">grain and and get a sense of how you</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.440" end="01:02:21.920" style="s2">know well you know you&#39;re sparring with</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.690" end="01:02:23.660" style="s2">somebody as you said you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.920" end="01:02:26.300" style="s2">just hit them cuz that they&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.660" end="01:02:28.100" style="s2">flock but can you get them off center</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.300" end="01:02:31.400" style="s2">and then there&#39;s possibilities that open</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.100" end="01:02:33.820" style="s2">up and so I think I think I like what</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.400" end="01:02:38.870" style="s2">you just said I like this idea about a</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.820" end="01:02:41.360" style="s2">connection between reconceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.870" end="01:02:42.950" style="s2">perhaps of authenticity by connecting it</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.360" end="01:02:45.559" style="s2">to getting people off script</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.950" end="01:02:48.500" style="s2">in you know in a way that shows finesse</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.559" end="01:02:50.780" style="s2">and affords inside it I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.500" end="01:02:52.250" style="s2">very I think that&#39;s very powerfully</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.780" end="01:02:56.210" style="s2">connected to what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.250" end="01:02:59.440" style="s2">with authenticity yeah that all of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.210" end="01:02:59.440" style="s2">rings very true and</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.730" end="01:03:07.800" style="s2">there&#39;s some things I can presence here</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.290" end="01:03:10.500" style="s2">that I think are vital and I supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.800" end="01:03:16.670" style="s2">go metal on it the turn is for me to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.500" end="01:03:16.670" style="s2">speak personally the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.730" end="01:03:25.020" style="s2">when we drop into the personal and move</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.109" end="01:03:27.770" style="s2">towards where we are vulnerable this has</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.020" end="01:03:27.770" style="s2">an effect on</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.950" end="01:03:33.890" style="s2">getting the context within which other</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.270" end="01:03:37.010" style="s2">participants may or may not be willing</p>

<p begin="01:03:37.010" end="01:03:42.109" style="s2">reference finesse because of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.890" end="01:03:44.180" style="s2">there are the three of us here but there</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.109" end="01:03:46.760" style="s2">are also more than the three of us here</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.180" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">at least potentially and this is very</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.760" end="01:03:52.700" style="s2">significant and this is an obstacle not</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:54.710" style="s2">an obstacle without it&#39;s an opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.700" end="01:03:57.740" style="s2">but an obstacle we all here</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.710" end="01:04:00.800" style="s2">face this notion of off-script is</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.740" end="01:04:04.010" style="s2">something that has had much resonance</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.800" end="01:04:06.349" style="s2">with me for a long time I in fact set up</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.010" end="01:04:09.950" style="s2">an event last year</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.349" end="01:04:12.560" style="s2">I hired out a theater and the event was</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.950" end="01:04:16.339" style="s2">called off script and I attempted to</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.560" end="01:04:19.550" style="s2">have people come along to that event but</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.339" end="01:04:23.300" style="s2">I cancelled it because I could not get</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.550" end="01:04:28.420" style="s2">anyone to come so the question is how</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.300" end="01:04:31.550" style="s2">then do you invite a setting where we</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.420" end="01:04:35.480" style="s2">really can&#39;t go off script because the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.550" end="01:04:40.190" style="s2">price is high the price of admission is</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.480" end="01:04:42.319" style="s2">much higher than a ticket because really</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.190" end="01:04:44.780" style="s2">if we were to open up again to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.319" end="01:04:49.369" style="s2">significance we are here a part of this</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.780" end="01:04:51.560" style="s2">moment we are in in the world the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.369" end="01:04:55.220" style="s2">vulnerability there the confrontation</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.560" end="01:04:59.420" style="s2">with death and perhaps worse that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.220" end="01:05:03.020" style="s2">there the various ways in which we may</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.420" end="01:05:08.089" style="s2">or may not have been seen with each</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.020" end="01:05:10.670" style="s2">other in this on this ride towards that</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.089" end="01:05:15.230" style="s2">which we perceive as perhaps ending and</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.670" end="01:05:20.260" style="s2">in suffering I think all magnifies each</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.230" end="01:05:20.260" style="s2">other and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.820" end="01:05:26.580" style="s2">yes things are about going off-script</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.060" end="01:05:28.080" style="s2">and they always have been and whether or</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.580" end="01:05:30.840" style="s2">not we were aware of it part of us</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.080" end="01:05:33.810" style="s2">always was we just lost awareness of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.840" end="01:05:37.290" style="s2">even as we ran out certain programs and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.810" end="01:05:40.530" style="s2">mistook perhaps programs for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.290" end="01:05:42.840" style="s2">totality but there are it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.530" end="01:05:45.330" style="s2">things we can&#39;t stand on and ground</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.840" end="01:05:48.320" style="s2">ourselves on even though that is not a</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.330" end="01:05:54.240" style="s2">fixed ground they are certain</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.320" end="01:05:57.240" style="s2">imperatives that we can or cannot accept</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.240" end="01:06:01.080" style="s2">a covenant if you like we can enter into</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.240" end="01:06:02.970" style="s2">of course all things can be broken but</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.080" end="01:06:05.960" style="s2">there are consequences to those to that</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.970" end="01:06:09.000" style="s2">breaking and so as we are here</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.960" end="01:06:11.010" style="s2">attempting to understand what is a for</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.000" end="01:06:13.590" style="s2">dn&#39;t of authenticity and what is a for</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.010" end="01:06:17.400" style="s2">dn&#39;t of or the presencing of</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.590" end="01:06:19.470" style="s2">authenticity in relationship as amiable</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.400" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">to a reciprocal opening and this</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.470" end="01:06:31.170" style="s2">abductive process of understanding we</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:34.200" style="s2">one thing I think can be put forward is</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.170" end="01:06:36.650" style="s2">that a commitment to be here now</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.200" end="01:06:39.810" style="s2">together at least for a certain duration</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.650" end="01:06:43.290" style="s2">knowing that cutting the duration itself</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.810" end="01:06:46.200" style="s2">is already limiting the context if we</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.290" end="01:06:52.830" style="s2">take that to be truly what we are doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.200" end="01:06:55.040" style="s2">so what does it mean to then truly</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.830" end="01:07:01.500" style="s2">commit to being here with each other and</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.040" end="01:07:04.830" style="s2">just how much are we able to integrate</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.500" end="01:07:10.560" style="s2">through that process even as someone</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.830" end="01:07:14.400" style="s2">drops into the space with the context</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.560" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">shifting and psyche unsettling and chaos</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.400" end="01:07:23.210" style="s2">inducing fluxes apparitions of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:25.560" style="s2">vulnerability of our existential</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.210" end="01:07:28.520" style="s2">predicament both now and perhaps also</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.560" end="01:07:28.520" style="s2">eternally</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.160" end="01:07:38.549" style="s2">to really step in is not a flippant one</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.530" end="01:07:40.770" style="s2">and this I suppose is not a bad place</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.549" end="01:07:49.140" style="s2">for me to for me to stop this and see if</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.770" end="01:07:54.630" style="s2">this is landed I it strikes me that what</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.140" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">what what you&#39;re talking about is a kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.630" end="01:08:04.230" style="s2">of rigor and that it&#39;s a rigor that I I</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:09.260" style="s2">have so much fection</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.230" end="01:08:09.260" style="s2">for because it&#39;s it&#39;s a rigor for</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.319" end="01:08:15.270" style="s2">perceiving and looking for maybe with</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.049" end="01:08:21.890" style="s2">that wonder that you were speaking of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.270" end="01:08:27.480" style="s2">earlier John you know interdependency is</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.890" end="01:08:30.920" style="s2">a lot of differences a lot of vitality a</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.480" end="01:08:37.049" style="s2">lot of interactions a lot of relational</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.920" end="01:08:38.870" style="s2">messiness and it&#39;s not to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.049" end="01:08:49.489" style="s2">underestimated</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.870" end="01:08:53.429" style="s2">the kind of the kind of multi sensory</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.489" end="01:08:59.370" style="s2">perception that it takes to pay</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.429" end="01:09:01.920" style="s2">attention in that way and so it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.370" end="01:09:06.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s not as if you can just do</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.920" end="01:09:10.500" style="s2">complexity as an intellectual game</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.210" end="01:09:13.860" style="s2">right it&#39;s if you don&#39;t allow that</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.500" end="01:09:19.500" style="s2">complexity to be perceived through your</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.860" end="01:09:23.490" style="s2">own complexity that is not just in words</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.500" end="01:09:27.060" style="s2">or jargons or maps but also in stories</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.490" end="01:09:30.210" style="s2">and music and unspoken sensed things and</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.060" end="01:09:33.630" style="s2">all kinds of other information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.210" end="01:09:36.240" style="s2">there you need all of it if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.630" end="01:09:39.990" style="s2">enter into that integrity or that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.240" end="01:09:45.450" style="s2">authenticity it&#39;s a kind of alertness in</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.990" end="01:09:48.120" style="s2">the rigor and so I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.450" end="01:09:49.920" style="s2">kind of hearing you say right off the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.120" end="01:09:51.930" style="s2">bat what do you think John what are you</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.920" end="01:09:54.120" style="s2">hearing well I&#39;m hearing something</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.930" end="01:09:58.050" style="s2">similar to that and overlaps with it and</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.120" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing the commitment and I like</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.050" end="01:10:07.410" style="s2">the notion of rigor I&#39;m hearing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:10.140" style="s2">noir that you&#39;re you talk about things I</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.410" end="01:10:11.700" style="s2">used the language of kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.140" end="01:10:13.740" style="s2">that are not propositional there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.700" end="01:10:15.690" style="s2">procedural knowing and respect travel</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.740" end="01:10:18.300" style="s2">and participatory and I think what</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.690" end="01:10:19.500" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is the knowing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.300" end="01:10:22.650" style="s2">using knowing that knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.500" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">deliberately knowing of complexity is</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.650" end="01:10:27.390" style="s2">something we only know within and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:29.100" style="s2">through our own complexity right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.390" end="01:10:31.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a participatory knowing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.100" end="01:10:34.890" style="s2">just a referential knowing and I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.170" end="01:10:37.740" style="s2">that&#39;s really important and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.890" end="01:10:44.840" style="s2">hearing that the commitment therefore is</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.740" end="01:10:47.160" style="s2">a kind of comprehensive commitment to I</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.840" end="01:10:56.280" style="s2">like this notion of rigor</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.160" end="01:10:58.770" style="s2">about trying to bring I well let me let</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.280" end="01:11:00.840" style="s2">me try it this way what I heard when I</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.770" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">heard that rigor and that you took it to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.840" end="01:11:04.770" style="s2">those deep levels in response to Tim</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:08.900" style="s2">he&#39;s like I said I&#39;m hearing I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.770" end="01:11:11.640" style="s2">virtue I&#39;m hearing I&#39;m hearing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.900" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">we&#39;re virtue doesn&#39;t mean the possession</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.640" end="01:11:16.890" style="s2">of a rule we reduced virtue which were</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.490" style="s2">it originally meant they sort of person</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.890" end="01:11:21.950" style="s2">hole capacity and power for D</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.490" end="01:11:23.900" style="s2">with you know the the messy ill-defined</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.950" end="01:11:27.250" style="s2">situations of life and then we reduced</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.900" end="01:11:30.500" style="s2">it to the possessions of sets of rules</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.250" end="01:11:33.650" style="s2">and you know and you know sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.500" end="01:11:35.360" style="s2">content procedures and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.650" end="01:11:37.280" style="s2">why the Aristotelian model of the virtue</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.360" end="01:11:41.530" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of something that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.280" end="01:11:44.720" style="s2">found between different kinds of vices</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.530" end="01:11:47.450" style="s2">vices of defect and vices of excess and</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.720" end="01:11:48.650" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s a virtue is more like a</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.450" end="01:11:51.830" style="s2">virtual engine it</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.650" end="01:11:53.720" style="s2">it&#39;s what constantly steers you between</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.830" end="01:11:55.820" style="s2">the vicissitudes of a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.720" end="01:11:59.900" style="s2">process so you don&#39;t fall out of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.820" end="01:12:03.830" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s what I hear Tim saying</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.900" end="01:12:06.710" style="s2">is is needed that people that come into</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.830" end="01:12:08.810" style="s2">these the intention to commit is</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.710" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">necessary but nowhere sufficient for</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.810" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">being able to commit you need particular</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.600" end="01:12:17.030" style="s2">skills and virtues in order to commit in</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:19.460" style="s2">the way we&#39;re talking about here now I</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.030" end="01:12:22.580" style="s2">don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to build a</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.460" end="01:12:24.170" style="s2">you know a catch-22 in here I think with</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.580" end="01:12:25.730" style="s2">the practice that Nora is talking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.170" end="01:12:28.670" style="s2">is a way in which people can start to</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.730" end="01:12:30.530" style="s2">cultivate of these virtues but I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.670" end="01:12:32.510" style="s2">to meet the normative demand that Tim is</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.530" end="01:12:34.640" style="s2">talking about I think we do need to talk</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.510" end="01:12:38.540" style="s2">about virtue at some point that these</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.640" end="01:12:40.970" style="s2">practices should result in people</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.540" end="01:12:43.370" style="s2">carrying away in their person not</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.970" end="01:12:46.010" style="s2">beliefs but carrying away skills and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.370" end="01:12:48.890" style="s2">virtues that transfer into multiple</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.010" end="01:12:51.080" style="s2">contexts in your life and I you know I</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.890" end="01:12:54.530" style="s2">think the meta virtue of course is</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.080" end="01:12:58.340" style="s2">wisdom and so I that&#39;s what I think is</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.530" end="01:13:00.590" style="s2">the normativity that I heard you</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.340" end="01:13:03.410" style="s2">pointing towards Tim and I think when</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.590" end="01:13:04.610" style="s2">you can when people can realize and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.410" end="01:13:06.860" style="s2">mean that in both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.610" end="01:13:09.080" style="s2">come to awareness and make real when</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.860" end="01:13:14.300" style="s2">people can realize that these practices</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.080" end="01:13:18.410" style="s2">our affording deeply affording of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.300" end="01:13:21.950" style="s2">cultivation of connectedness and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.410" end="01:13:24.410" style="s2">virtues that would properly how&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.950" end="01:13:26.480" style="s2">and and guide it</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.410" end="01:13:28.790" style="s2">I think that&#39;s deeply motivating to</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.480" end="01:13:30.500" style="s2">people I think that&#39;s deeply motivating</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.790" end="01:13:33.050" style="s2">to people I think that goes back towards</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.500" end="01:13:34.880" style="s2">you know giving them a taste</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.050" end="01:13:37.250" style="s2">but a taste of the good if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.880" end="01:13:38.810" style="s2">me a platonic word and you know what you</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.250" end="01:13:40.550" style="s2">know what Nora was talking about sounded</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.810" end="01:13:42.980" style="s2">so similar to me to what Iris Murdoch</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.550" end="01:13:45.410" style="s2">talks about when she talks about the you</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.980" end="01:13:47.719" style="s2">know the the the necessity for paying</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.410" end="01:13:50.540" style="s2">you know to for a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.719" end="01:13:52.070" style="s2">complex attention and she it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.540" end="01:13:55.100" style="s2">the sovereignty of the good for a reason</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.070" end="01:13:57.170" style="s2">she she allies that capacity with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.100" end="01:13:59.500" style="s2">ability to orient towards the good to</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.170" end="01:14:02.360" style="s2">love the good to be tempted by the good</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.500" end="01:14:05.330" style="s2">and I think when people get a taste for</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.360" end="01:14:09.140" style="s2">this Tim that could really afford the</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.330" end="01:14:10.940" style="s2">kind of commitment that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.140" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">about that&#39;s what that&#39;s how that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.940" end="01:14:20.300" style="s2">I hear yes yes um can I ask how I just</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.800" end="01:14:22.580" style="s2">think it appropriate here to just check</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.300" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">in and to be conscious of everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.580" end="01:14:29.180" style="s2">time what are we looking at over the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:33.770" style="s2">next few minutes here I&#39;m I had us down</p>

<p begin="01:14:40.550" end="01:14:46.280" style="s2">presumptive and I don&#39;t want a corner</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.980" end="01:14:48.020" style="s2">Nora in any way or you Tim but I&#39;m happy</p>
